<p>Everything has a beginning &ndash; including evil. But what is the origin of evil? Some say it&rsquo;s the shadow world. Some say it is humans themselves that manifest evil. But whatever the case, what happens if evil comes to overshadow the light? Something that is never meant to happen &ndash; might happen &ndash; the merger of the shadow world and the regular world. How can one fight the true essence of evil?</p>

<p>&ldquo;No...this cannot be true!&rdquo; screamed the silver haired man.</p>

<p>The woman and man, dressed in rich clothes, laughed at the man&rsquo;s misfortune. He was on the ground, bleeding from a deep wound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why...Elinora...why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You fool! Did you really think I loved you? Face the truth. You have no money and no power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is right. You will learn one day, that power and money are everything.&rdquo; said the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nooooo!!!&rdquo; screamed the victim. He was heart-broken and grief-stricken. It was as if his heart split in two.</p>

<p>Arthur hit him with his sword. Chop! He saw a pool of blood...his own blood. His vision was blinded by red&#8230;</p>


<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="1">1: Introduction </span></p></center>

</span></p></center><p>All was quiet in the alley. A poor, ragged man was crouched behind a garbage can, shivering. He was smoking Angel Dust. He sniffed the white stuff and enjoyed it. The pain and negative emotions he felt suddenly disappeared. He sighed in relief.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a shadow figure emerged from the shadows. Its glaring red eyes stared in hatred. The drug man turned around and screamed cowardly. &ldquo;What...what are you?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Vega, ruler of the shadow world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not real...this is all in my head!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just need your energy.&rdquo; Vega attacked.</p>

<p>The man collapsed, blood splattered on the wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are we going today?&rdquo; asked Junior.</p>

<p>Faith bent down a little bit to look at her son in the eyes. &ldquo;We are going to see your grandfather today. Isn&rsquo;t that exciting?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yay! I can&rsquo;t wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He seems excited.&rdquo; said Tyson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because father always gives him a present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow. I wish I had a grandfather like that. In fact, I wish I had a grandfather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will be one someday.&rdquo; Faith said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not anytime soon.&rdquo; Tyson replied.</p>

<p>Nebula walked along the market place, looking and glancing at the products the salesmen have to offer. There were mostly fruit stands, stores that sold fish, clothing, jewelry, and accessories. People walked about casually, as usual. A kid ran past Nebula, almost bumping him. Then two other kids in bikes chased him. &ldquo;Wait for us!&rdquo; they said.</p>

<p>Ahhh, it sure is a nice day, Nebula thought. The sky was perfectly blue and not a cloud was in sight. What could possibly go wrong on this glorious day?</p>

<p>A man ran desperately in his direction and pushed him. &ldquo;Hey, at least say excuse me!&rdquo; he shouted ungratefully. Then he saw Marianna running after that man. She ran past him, not seeing him. &ldquo;Marianna? What is she up to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He figured standing around won&rsquo;t help answer his questions, so he went after Marianna. After several blocks of chasing, he finally caught up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alright, you thief, there is no place to run.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man searched desperately for a way to escape, but found none. He was in a dead end, and the only way out was through Marianna. She took out a bow and arrow.</p>

<p>Nebula came. &ldquo;What's going on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;Now, thief, give back what you have stolen and no one will be hurt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here! Just don't kill me!&rdquo; he said. He threw the small bag at the floor.</p>

<p>Marianna picked it up, then felt it. &ldquo;Hey...one coin is missing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The thief was already climbing up the wall, his legs pushing on the bricks. Marianna grabbed his feet and pulled him down. Wham!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hand it over.&rdquo; she said, opening her palm.</p>

<p>The thief took out a coin from his pocket and gave it to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good. Next time earn your money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula now understood what happened.</p>

<p>Nebula and Marianna were walking back to the castle. &ldquo;So, how are you getting used to this world? Actually that&rsquo;s a stupid question...you just got robbed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, other than the bad people, I&rsquo;d say this place is pretty neat.&rdquo; Marianna replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty neat? So you like it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, whether I like it or not, it does not matter. It won&rsquo;t change how things are.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;That's true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome back, Marianna!&rdquo; said Ace, waving.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hi Acelot!&rdquo; she said, waving back.</p>

<p>The man in the woods stood still, getting ready to chop the tree down. He spit in his hands, rubbed them, and then picked up the axe. Tyson gave a powerful swing; the axe&rsquo;s blade went into the tree trunk. He took it out and then gave it another swing. Chop. He estimated it will take about four or five more to chop it down.</p>

<p>Tyson was about to chop, but before the blade touched the tree, it fell. Timber. Tyson was shocked. What could have done this? He looked behind and gasped. A familiar face emerged from the darkness. If it wasn&rsquo;t for his head, he would have been nothing but a black silhouette, completely camouflaged with darkness.</p>

<p>Tyson&rsquo;s pupils dilated and his jaw dropped. &ldquo;Vega?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am back. Did you miss me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson grunted. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a stupid question. I want revenge for what you did to me. You have spoiled my plans a second time, Tyson. But this time I will not fail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo; Tyson charged and punched.</p>

<p>Vega leaped like a tiger and dodged his fist. He jumped all around the place with super speed. Tyson was barely able to keep up with him. His movements were so fast it looked like he was a bunch of lines jumping around.</p>

<p>Tyson formed an energy ball and threw it. Vega jumped, dodging the ball. He attacked Tyson and he fell. &ldquo;Oof!&rdquo; He got up, feeling a pain on his chest. He grabbed his chest and moaned. &ldquo;What...what did you do to me?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I gave you a curse. The curse of Shadow World.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A curse? What kind of curse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One that you will never forget nor remember. It is a symbiotic life form that drains your life energy. It feeds off of it&rsquo;s victim&rsquo;s emotions. Each time you feel a positive emotion it will drain you life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are about to suffer great pain. But you will not die. Whenever you have positive emotions you will feel the pain, thus forcing you to feel only negative emotions. And eventually, the negative emotions fill up your mind so much that you will no longer be you. You will feel only hatred, anger, and sorrow, and become evil. Ha ha ha ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson charged, Vega smacked him away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bastard...this is...not over...&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vega disappeared into the woods.</p>

<p>Tyson woke up, breathing hard. The event that occurred earlier (or did it?) seemed like a bad dream. Did it really happen? He was unclear and not sure. Maybe it didn&rsquo;t happen. Yeah, it was a bad dream. Just to make sure, Tyson took off his shirt and checked.</p>

<p>The symbiotic life form was stuck to his chest. It was like a piece of black bubble gum glued to him. It had a pulse, beating at the same rate as a human heart. &ldquo;No...no!!! No!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Knock knock. &ldquo;Whos&rsquo; there?&rdquo; Faith asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tyson? Where have you been? You said you were getting some lumber. And five hours later you return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry, I was having too much fun out there and didn&rsquo;t keep track of time.&rdquo; He went in and Faith closed the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost dinner time. Help out with the stuff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure thing.&rdquo; As Tyson set the dishes, he just realized he was hungry. He could feel his stomach talking to him. Feed me, it said. Since Faith improved her cooking, Tyson loved her food. They were so delicious. Then he thought about how lucky he was. A loving family was all that a man needed. Suddenly his chest hurt. He grabbed it and moaned. &ldquo;Ughhhh...ugh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;Tyson? What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uhh...uhh...uhhh...&rdquo; One hand was on the table, the other on his chest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tyson? You alright?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. Really.&rdquo; he responded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; she asked, not convinced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah...it&rsquo;s just that Nebula punched me too hard today. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brothers shouldn&rsquo;t fight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know. But we just can&rsquo;t help it, ya know?&rdquo; He forced a laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, really. Let&rsquo;s eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson just hoped no more incidents like that happened. As he ate, he remembered Vega&rsquo;s words before he fell unconscious. Whenever you have positive emotions you will feel the pain, thus forcing you to feel only negative emotions. Luckily for him, the dinner went successfully. Junior ate like a pig as Faith taught him table manners.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now now, you use a fork like this.&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ohhh mom I don&rsquo;t wanna do use that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson tried his best not to think or feel anything. He just ate and did nothing else.</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;This is how you use a fork, see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Junior: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stick it into the steak!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, you&rsquo;re holding it wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson thought the food was delicious. Brocolli, steak, and fried fish. What could be better? He felt very lucky. Because he had a wonderful, loving family. A woman who loves him and a son who loves him. What more does a man need? Suddenly, while thinking these things, his heart gave him great pain. He choked and gasped and moaned. He slammed his hand on the table, and the dishes made noises. He stood up, his butt knocking the chair down.</p>

<p>Faith gasped. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Junior: &ldquo;Daddy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at them with embarrassment. &ldquo;Ummm&#8230;I&rsquo;m fine, really.&rdquo; he said, forcing himself to sound as normal as possible. &ldquo;Really.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah, positive. Nebula and I practiced today and he roughed me up good. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; He sat down and resumed eating. He just hoped no more things like that happened, especially during dinner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You two should really not take it so rough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah, well, that&rsquo;s how we are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you are alright?&rdquo; she asked again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Half an hour passed. Tyson survived dinner and immediately went up to his room. Faith wondered what the hurry was. She pushed that thought aside, realizing she had to do the dishes.</p>

<p>Derik was meditating inside a mountain, a place he chose that he felt very comfortable. The walls were surrounded with green vines and flowers. There was a hole on the ceiling and it was the only source of light. Derik sat on a piece of rock surrounded by clear water.</p>

<p>He had been doing this for hours. But no matter how hard he tried, he couldn&rsquo;t keep his mind clear. Thoughts of his father and Vega kept contaminating him. He saw an image of his father killing an innocent man in cold blood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How will I go on in this state? How do I expect to be forgiven for the sins I have committed in the past? My hands are tainted with blood, and my heart is tainted with evil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly, the wall cracked and exploded. &ldquo;Forgiveness is for the weak.&rdquo; said Vega.</p>

<p>Derik gasped in surprise. &ldquo;V-Vega? What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Derik, you traitor! Did you not forget that you and your father worked for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am no traitor! It was my father who served you, not me! I had been misled all of my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not let you poison my mind any further, Vega.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will give you one chance. Rejoin my side and I will forgive you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In your dreams!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have it your way.&rdquo; He shot out a tentacle from his arm. Derik slashed it with his sword. More tentacles came at him. He jumped and slashed Vega in the air. Vega knocked the sword away and punched him. He fell face flat. Derik got up and gathered energy, then released a spiritual energy ball. It hit Vega but he blocked it with his shield.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn! His power is just too great!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vega&rsquo;s tentacles caught him and slammed him against the wall. Wham! One tentacle went around his neck and choked him. &ldquo;You will become a part of my force once again, whether you like it or not.&rdquo; He shot out tentacles, tying up Derik.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nooo!&rdquo; He struggled but fell unconscious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uhhhh&#8230;&rdquo; Derik moaned as he was about to wake up. He found himself in chains, stuck to a piece of wood. It was a large, dark room, and Vega liked dark rooms. &ldquo;W-Where am I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vega got up from his seat and went towards him. &ldquo;Where do you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this? Why am I still alive? I thought you&rsquo;d kill me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. You are the only successor to your father, and now that he is dead, you are the only one who possesses his abilities. You are useful to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that how you measure people? By their usefulness?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be careful what you say, traitor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am no traitor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You betrayed your father!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was wrong! You are wrong!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wrong? How can you judge what is right and wrong?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Someone like you, Vega, would never understand the values of love and peace!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! You may be right, those mean nothing to me. And yet, you will never understand my ambitions. &rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not just kill me right here and now and get it over with?&rdquo; Derik said, and he meant it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no. There are much more fun things than killing. You are still useful to me. If I cannot make you join willingly, I have other ways of making you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will never go back to your side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh but you will. You will.&rdquo; He extended his arm and a black, slimy substance crawled its way to Derik.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this?! Get away from me! Ahhhh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop it! Ahhhhhh!&rdquo; The black slime tore the clothes on his chest and attached itself to his body.</p>

<p>Derik woke up, sweating and panting. He found himself in the middle of a barren land. Apparently, Vega had released him, he thought. &ldquo;Why? Why didn&rsquo;t he kill me?&rdquo; he wondered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything is going according to plan.&rdquo; Vega said. &ldquo;If it weren&rsquo;t for Derik, that blasted traitor, I would have accomplished my goals by now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vega was satisfied with the results. Both Tyson and Derik have now been infected with the Curse of Emotions, and it will only be a matter of time (as everything is) before Tyson goes insane and Derik joins him. How could I possibly fail, he thought to himself. He was beaten before, but now he has a full proof plan.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a slithery white ghost appeared from out of nowhere. It had the face of a woman, twisted and ugly.</p>

<p>Vega: &ldquo;What&#8230;what are you? Be gone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly, another ghost appeared.</p>

<p>It did not matter to Vega whether they were real or just in his head. He saw them, and that means they <em>were </em>here. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>_Have you forgettin already, Darwen?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you recognize us. You do...&quot;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! I cannot be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&quot;Do not deny it. You know who we are...you killed us...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You killed us...&quot;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! Stay away from me!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The spirits circled around him in the air, laughing, moaning, and taunting him. They kept on repeating the phrase: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your fault! You killed us!&rdquo; over and over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be gone! Be gone!! Nooooo!&rdquo; Vega collapsed from his seat and fell on his knees, and he grabbed his head and screamed in agony. &ldquo;Noooooo! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just coming from home, Tyson opened the door, expecting his wife and son to be home and greet him happily. But the house was empty. Not a soul was in sight.</p>

<p>Where the heck are they? Tyson thought. He looked upstairs in the bedroom, but no one was there. He was now sure they&rsquo;re gone. Maybe they&rsquo;re on some trip or went shopping. But how could they not tell me and just not be home like that? He suddenly felt a little angry and frustrated.</p>

<p>Maybe those two have a little too much freedom. Coming and going as they like. Who do they think I am? I&rsquo;m the man of the house, yeah. I&rsquo;m the boss here, and that&rsquo;s that.</p>

<p>Faith and Junior came home happily, chatting and laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where have you two been?&rdquo; Tyson asked impatiently.</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;Oh nowhere. Just to the toy store.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson looked at Junior&rsquo;s hand, and he was holding a new robot action figure of some kind. Great, he thought, you two were having fun while I&rsquo;m stuck with this curse. &ldquo;Toys? Doesn&rsquo;t he have enough toys? He should be studying more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh come on. It wouldn&rsquo;t hurt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry.&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You were supposed to be cooking now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just a few minutes late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A few minutes? More like half an hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; She took off her jacket and went to the kitchen and put on an apron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you angry all of a sudden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Angry? I&rsquo;m not angry.&rdquo; He went upstairs.</p>

<p>Derik, miserable and suffering, was walking towards Macintosh&rsquo;s laboratory. He was limping through each step with his hand on his chest. &ldquo;Uhhh&#8230;uggh.&rdquo; He was almost there, but at certain times he thought he would not make it.</p>

<p>As he approached the bedroom, Tyson opened the door sneakily as if this was not his house. Faith was dusting the wall, humming. Tyson closed the door, making a light sound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Tyke?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>Tyson grabbed her, which surprised her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t done it in a long time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Tyke-&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on. Just this once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But right now?&rdquo; she asked reluctantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now is better than later. Come on.&rdquo; He kissed her and she resisted at first, but then she let him, becoming passive. He kissed her neck and grabbed her shoulders. He pulled down her sweater, revealing her shoulders and her under shirt.</p>

<p>Junior was playing with a handball and accidentally dropped it, and it rolled into the bedroom. He went in to pick it up.</p>

<p>Tyson and Faith suddenly let go of each other and let out a shriek of surprise. &ldquo;You little brat! Didn&rsquo;t anyone tell you to knock?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Junior, not knowing what happened, but knowing that his father just yelled at him so loudly, felt like garbage, and his eyes were wet. He ran out.</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;Tyson, what&rsquo;s wrong with you? He&rsquo;s just a kid.&rdquo; She pulled her sweater back up and left the room.</p>

<p>Tyson was pissed. &ldquo;Oh fine, be like that. Pay all attention to the kid and not me.&rdquo; Nobody heard him.</p>

<p>Tyson noticed that the lamp he liked was missing. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the lamp?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh? You mean the one that was over there? I sold it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You what?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you wouldn&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson was outraged, and it showed in his voice. He stood up and started yelling. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t mind? I like that goddamn lamp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith gasped. &ldquo;When did you pick up that kind of language?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can curse when I want, got it? That&rsquo;s not the issue here. You sold it without asking me. I bought that thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry? One little &lsquo;sorry&rsquo; will solve it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, calm down!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I AM calm!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith stood up. &ldquo;What is the matter with you? Recently, you are always yelling and becoming bad-tempered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t be pissed if you didn&rsquo;t piss me off. You think this is some fucking charity, don&rsquo;t you? Selling things if you feel like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t necessary&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was to ME! That&rsquo;s what matters. You just come and go out of this house like its some charity. This is my house! I make the decisions. Not you! Me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith grunted. &ldquo;Since when did you start talking like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been too easy on you, I guess. You think this is all just a playground, don&rsquo;t you? I am the man of the house. I make the decisions. This is my family. You must ask me before doing a single thing.&rdquo; He banged the desk, and it cracked.</p>

<p>Faith was getting scared. &ldquo;Tyson&#8230;you&rsquo;ve changed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Changed? I&rsquo;ve always been like this. I&rsquo;ve been busting my guts to raise you and our son, and what do I get in return? Squat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tyson, stop yelling, please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell me what to do.&rdquo; He grabbed her arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re hurting me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, admit you&rsquo;re wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; She pushed him off, and ran upstairs, into the bedroom.</p>

<p>Junior looked at her with innocent curiosity. &ldquo;Mom, why are you and dad yelling?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing. Nothing at all.&rdquo; She closed the door.</p>

<p>Tyson banged on the door. Bang bang. &ldquo;Open up this instant. Come on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith held Junior in her arms and wished he&rsquo;d go away. Bang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Open Faith!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just leave, please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson went down the stairs, angrier than ever. He could&rsquo;ve broken the door with his bare fist, but he&rsquo;d rather not destroy his own house. After all, he&rsquo;d be the one who has to fix it up.</p>

<p>Faith was relieved he&rsquo;s gone. How could he have changed this much? It&rsquo;s like Tyson became a different person overnight. His behavior is getting worst and worst, from abusive to completely insane. Enough is enough, she thought. Tyson&rsquo;s no different than a madman, and it&rsquo;s best to stay away from him.</p>

<p>Junior: &ldquo;Mom, why are you packing the things? Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pack up your clothes, Junior. And put all your toys on one bag.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are we going? Why do we have to leave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She bent down. &ldquo;We have to get away from your father. He is not normal, son. It is for our own good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He nodded stupidly.</p>

<p>Faith, holding Junior&rsquo;s hand, went down the stairs with their bags. She looked around, being cautious. Suddenly, Tyson was at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going somewhere?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith realized she was caught. &ldquo;Go upstairs, Junior. Go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson approached. &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nowhere&#8230;nowhere at all.&rdquo; She backed away nervously. She was against the wall. &ldquo;Just going&#8230;shopping.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh? Since when do you take your clothes to shopping?!&rdquo; He grabbed the luggage and threw them on the floor like it was insignificant trash. &ldquo;Huh? Tell me.&rdquo; he yelled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m s-sorry&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry? Why did you try to leave? You ungrateful brat! After all I did for you.&rdquo; He grabbed her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. Tyson&#8230;let me go, you&rsquo;re hurting me!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, from now on you do as I say! Got it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alright, alright, I will listen to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He let her go. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s better. If only you were more obedient from the start.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shrank away from him and went to the bedroom.</p>

<p>*Knock knock* Macintosh paused his work and answered the door. Derik was outside, and he fell into Macintosh&rsquo;s arms. &ldquo;Ahhh Derik?? You alright?&rdquo;</p>


<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="2">2: Curse of Emotions </span></p></center>

<p>It was night time. Faith was standing outside the house, looking up at Junior, who was by the window. &ldquo;Come on, Junior.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The kid jumped and landed on his feet perfectly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mother and son ran into the forest.</p>

<p>Tyson could sense their ki&rsquo;s disappearing. He never had to use his ki in the house before, since it takes up energy. By the time he realized they were fleeing, they were already gone. Tyson looked out the window and saw nothing but trees and the darkness of the night.</p>

<p>Tyson sat alone in the kitchen. His face turned into a grimace as he was absorbed by his angry thoughts.</p>

<p>Family, family family&#8230;they&rsquo;re my family! My family! Yes, that&rsquo;s right, my family. Mine, mine, no one else&rsquo;s. I am the man of the family. That&rsquo;s the bottom line. I bust my neck to raise them. My wife, my son. I gave her a home. I gave her everything. And my son would not be here without me. Ungrateful brat. He always tries to avoid me. It&rsquo;s time to teach him a thing or two about respect. Respect for a father. A husband. I protect them, and what do they give me? Hostility? Disobedience. I will not let them disobey. Not anymore. Things will change. Oh yes they will. Time to show them who&rsquo;s boss - me.</p>

<p>He stuck the knife on the table. *Stab!* It cracked. If you look at the bottom, you could see the knife went through the wood.</p>

<p>In Harmony Park, the gang gathered together to discuss some disturbing news.</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;What happened, Faith?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zelfire: &ldquo;He tried to hurt you and Junior?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did this start?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Junior was asleep, so the adults thought it&rsquo;d safe to talk about it. It&rsquo;s better that way. Faith stared at the ground the whole time. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know!! He just became more violent. Something must&rsquo;ve happened. It must be some kind of spell!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;It could be that, or he&rsquo;s completely lost his mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lisa: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. We&rsquo;ll straighten this out for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula pounded his fist. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got some explaining to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson&rsquo;s senses led him to Harmony Park. He was surprised to see the others here. &ldquo;What&rsquo;re you all doing here?&rdquo; he asked as if they were strangers.</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like to ask you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Macintosh: &ldquo;You should be ashamed of yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;The hell is this? What are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zelfire: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pretend. Faith told us everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He grunted. &ldquo;This is none of your business. It&rsquo;s my family affairs&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re picking on a child and a woman, it&rsquo;s our business. Is what Faith said true? She would not lie to us like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;Despicable! What is wrong with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson was extremely pissed now. &ldquo;This is <strong>my</strong> family! I don&rsquo;t need your interference, got it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;Tyson, stop this! Tell me what&rsquo;s wrong!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8230;you shut up. How dare you run away like that. After all I did for you. You ungrateful little&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula grabbed him by the collar. &ldquo;What is wrong with you, Tyson?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson got free and punched Nebula in the face. *Kapow* He landed face flat with a bruise. Everybody was shocked.</p>

<p>Neb: &ldquo;You&#8230;bastard!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zell: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s your own brother, dude!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson&rsquo;s attitude did not change. &ldquo;You deserved it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula lost all control and attacked Tyson. They punched and grabbed each other. Everybody went to them and grabbed the brothers.</p>

<p>Tyson was screaming and struggling violently. &ldquo;Let me go! Let me go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula showed only passive resistance. &ldquo;Let go of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Macintosh and Zelfire were losing their grip on Tyke. He powered up, which tossed them aside. *Wham*</p>

<p>Tyke gathered energy into his palm, causing everyone to be on alert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! You wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Nebula.</p>

<p>Derik appeared and did a karate chop on Tyke&rsquo;s neck, causing him to fall unconscious.</p>

<p>Zell: &ldquo;Derik? What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mac put a needle into Tyson&rsquo;s neck, injecting a liquid. &ldquo;This should calm him down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;What is wrong with him. Why did it turn out like this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derik: &ldquo;I know the answer.&rdquo; Everybody paid attention to him. &ldquo;He has the same curse as me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zell: &ldquo;Curse?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;What curse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The curse of shadow world.&rdquo; Derik took off his shirt, revealing a black slimy substance stuck to his chest. Everybody gasped in surprise. &ldquo;This is what is causing this. Check Tyson&rsquo;s chest. He should have something like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula took off Tyke&rsquo;s shirt, and Derik was right, the black slime was there.</p>

<p>Faith gasped with her hands over her mouth. &ldquo;What in the world...&rdquo;</p>

<p>Macintosh: &ldquo;That was what caused his abnormal behavior?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derik: &ldquo;That behavior he exhibited is a side effect. You see, this curse is a special type of curse from the shadow world, a very deadly one. Whenever its victim feels a position emotion, he will suffer great pain. As a result, he can only feel negative emotions which plague the mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zell: &ldquo;Positive emotions? You mean&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. He can only feel negative emotions, think negative thoughts, and his character will eventually degrade. This is the curse of the shadow world, also known as the Curse of Emotions. Centuries ago, an entire town was plagued with the curse. No one knew how it started, but it spread until everybody had it. The entire town turned into hell. Everybody slaughtered and killed each other. Buildings were burned. It was worse than a war.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;So&#8230;what will happen to Tyson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eventually, he will become the opposite of what he was before. He will feel only hatred, scorn, contempt, jealousy, possessive, and anything that is negative. And soon, I will suffer the same fate.</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;That is terrible!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derik: &ldquo;One thing I still am not clear about&#8230;since Vega gave this curse to us, that means he must have it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lisa: &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because the curse is contagious. A person can only get the curse from another infected person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;So Vega has the same curse as you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be surprised. This is Vega we&rsquo;re talking about, our mortal enemy. The one who destroyed kingdoms, the one who merged the dimensions, responsible for many deaths.</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. I had no idea&#8230;that all along, Vega had a curse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zell: &ldquo;Wait a minute...if the curse degrades your character, does that mean that Vega...at one point in time...was not evil?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;Non-sense. I can&rsquo;t imagine Vega being a good guy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;Wait, since it&rsquo;s contagious, can we get it from you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derik: &ldquo;No. It spreads only if the victim wants to spread it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;Yep. We can trust you and Tyson&#8230;for now&#8230;that is, until you turn crazy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;Until then, what can we do about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mac: &ldquo;I want to study this curse. I&rsquo;ll take Tyson to my lab and study him in depth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;Do you think you can cure him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mac: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know...curses are beyond the realm of science. But I&rsquo;m sure that science has a solution to this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mari touched Faith&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Let him handle things. You need to rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gang went back to the Imperial Palace to explain everything to King Midas. Although he can&rsquo;t fight like the others, he is the oldest and currently wisest one of the group.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think, your majesty?&rdquo; asked Acelot.</p>

<p>Midas rubbed his beard. &ldquo;Hmmm...so Vega gave Tyson and Derik the Curse of Emotions. And this curse originated from the Shadow World. That means that Vega must have originated from the Shadow World.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derik: &ldquo;Do you know how to dispel the curse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas: &ldquo;Unfortunately, I do not. This is the first time I&rsquo;ve heard about this curse. But maybe the Sacred Scrolls have the answer. But what I wonder is...why is Vega&rsquo;s motive for doing this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Acelot: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s simple. He wants to infect all of us so that we can suffer with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mari: &ldquo;First he wants to kill us, now he wants to do this? We&rsquo;ll never know what he&rsquo;s thinking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas: &ldquo;What I fear is not what has happened, but what is coming. The fact that he brings the curse of the shadow world...means that he is bringing the shadow world to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p> Zell: &ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He plans to merge the shadow world with ours...&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everyone was shocked. &ldquo;That can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo; said Neb. &ldquo;He already merged two dimensions...are you saying there&rsquo;s another one? And he wants to merge that one too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas: &ldquo;Perhaps that was his plan all along. The shadow world is a dark place of which all evil and demons originate. It is said that Pandora&rsquo;s Box is nothing more than a portal to the shadow world.&rdquo;</p>

<p> Acelot: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard legends about it, but I never knew such a place actually exists! And it sounds really bad!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mari: &ldquo;But last time, the sorcerer named Dragon helped Vega merged our worlds. He has none this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;He may not need one, or maybe he has one, just not from this world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mari: &ldquo;He has a sorcerer from the shadow world?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neb: &ldquo;Ugh! I don&rsquo;t understand anything of this. What are we supposed to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas: &ldquo;The Silver Crystal has huge amounts of spiritual power. He needs it to merge the dimensions. Destroy the Silver Crystal and the merger will be stopped.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derik: &ldquo;And what of the curse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas: &ldquo;You must kill Vega. It is the only way to lift the curse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neb: &ldquo;Easier said than done. We&rsquo;ve killed him many times, but he still keeps coming back!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zell: &ldquo;We have to figure out a way. Killing him would be the simplest solution...and the most efficient. We have to find Vega before he plots something else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hours later, Macintosh came back to the palace and gave Faith his solution to the curse. He brought two metal head bands with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is it?&rdquo; she asked curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, basically. I worked very hard on it. It&rsquo;s still in its beta stage though, because I have not tested it yet.&rdquo; He was going to explain how it actually works and even mention some big scientific terms, but he realized it was a bad habit, and especially not appropriate at a time like this. He just explained the most crucial stuff. &ldquo;Put this band on his head. Once it is on, he will not be able to feel any emotions. None of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No emotions? Will it have&#8230;side effects?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. He may turn into a walking statue, but other than that, there should be no harmful effects. It was the best solution. I could think of. If he does not feel, then he will not be hurt. And he will not turn mad again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith remained silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is your choice.&rdquo; Mac said, placing the head band in her hand.</p>

<p>Zell: &ldquo;So when he wears it, he can no longer feel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lisa: &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there any other way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mac: &ldquo;It was the best I could think of. Sorry, guys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zell: &ldquo;No need to apologize. You did your best. I think this is better than before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey Derik,&rdquo; Mac said. &ldquo;I have one for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No thanks.&rdquo; he replied. The whole time he had his hand on his heart. &ldquo;I have no need for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be able to feel these emotions is one of the greatest joys of my life. I only learned this when I met all of you. I do not want to have them taken away. I have done so much wrongs in the past&#8230;I deserve to suffer. Let us think of this as retribution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one disagreed with his honorable decision. Mac rubbed his head. &ldquo;Oh well, it looks like I made another one for nothing. I&rsquo;ll keep it as a spare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vega is once again up to no good. &ldquo;Demons of the other world, arrive on my command! I summon you to this realm!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Three shadows appeared one at a time from the floor. They had no form at first, but then they transformed into people. &ldquo;Ah, Lord Vega. What do you need of us?&rdquo; asked the first shadow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You demons are famous in the shadow world. Alpha, Beta, Omega, I have a job for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything you command.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dispose of those who get in our way. You know who I am talking about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will, mighty Lord Vega. We will not fail.&rdquo; The three demons sank into the ground.</p>

<p>For the rest of the day, Tyson slept soundly in bed, the bed that he and Faith has shared for many years. Faith brought him home (with some help of course). Nebula waved goodbye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll watch over Tyson, so don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo; said Faith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah. I know.&rdquo; Nebula flew away.</p>

<p>For the rest of the evening, Faith watched over Tyson as he slept. He moaned slightly when she put a wet cloth on his forehead. She&rsquo;d do that once a while to prevent him from getting a fever.</p>

<p>Faith sighed as she stared at his face. Seeing him like this just made her heart break. Tyson has turned from a kind man to an obsessed, abusive degenerate virtually overnight. He even picked a fight with his brother. And it&rsquo;s only going to get worse from here.</p>

<p>She clutched the head band in her palm. Is this item the only answer? Once he puts it on, he will never be the same again. Tyson will be a man with no emotions whatsoever. A man with no feelings...what will he be like? Can she still live with him like before? Will Junior be able to see him as a father?</p>

<p>She sat there for a long time, thinking about it. She literally had the answer in her hands. The question is... will she use it?</p>

<p>By night, when Tyson woke up, he felt like he had awakened from months of sleep. Faith told him everything about the head band which Macintosh created. Tyke understood. She let him make the decision.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo; He took the band from the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tyson&#8230;are you sure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To prevent my loved ones from getting hurt&#8230;that is a man&rsquo;s job. If it means not being able to feel anything, then so be it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&#8230;but then we&#8230;we will not be the same again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know&#8230;but this is the best way.&rdquo; He put on the head band.</p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="3">3: Shapeshifting Shadows </span></p></center>

<p>Outside of the Spades house, on the green fields, the &lsquo;new&rsquo; Tyson pondered at the sky.</p>

<p> &ldquo;How do you feel?&rdquo; Faith asked. &ldquo;Oh, stupid question. You don&rsquo;t feel anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson heard her loud and clear, but he did not answer. To answer her pointless question is inefficient, and instead, his glues were glued to the sky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sure is a nice day, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He may not be able to feel emotions, but Tyson did feel something that is hard to describe. It is emptiness, meaninglessness, and aimlessness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strange.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is?&rdquo; she asked, slightly excited that he finally said something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot feel a thing.&rdquo; he said robotically. &ldquo;This is strange&#8230;I can&rsquo;t describe it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know, it must be hard. Come on, let&rsquo;s have some tea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Situated outside the house was a white table with an umbrella over it. They sat down and Faith poured him some tea, then poured herself tea.</p>

<p>Tyson grabbed the cup by the handle and stared at the liquid for a while, then he reluctantly took a sip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is it?&rdquo; inquired Faith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;It&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine? It&rsquo;s just fine?&rdquo; Faith sighed. &ldquo;I wish you can get back to normal soon. How long is this going to last?&rdquo; She said that despite knowing that Tyson will not respond. It feels like she&rsquo;s talking to a doll.</p>

<p> Marianna showed up. &ldquo;Yo. What&rsquo;s up Faye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marianne. Is something up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s Tyson doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith sighed. &ldquo;Look for yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson sipped his tea as if testing its taste, ignoring the women.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see. It must be boring, huh?&rdquo; Marianna commented.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; she replied in a non-caring tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have to go to the castle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith stood up. &ldquo;Okay. Come on Tyson, we have to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith, Marianne and Tyson entered the castle halls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guys, what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; said Faith.</p>

<p>Zell: &ldquo;How&rsquo;s Tyson doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula went towards his bro. &ldquo;So, you really can&rsquo;t feel anything?&rdquo; He waved his hand up and down in front of his face.</p>

<p>Tyson looked at him stupidly. &ldquo;Why are you doing that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neb: &ldquo;Oh my God. That means&#8230;he&rsquo;s no different than a robot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Macintosh: &ldquo;Basically.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zell: &ldquo;Mac, what have you done to him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, is this the thanks I get for helping?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;This was the best way, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derik still had his hand over his heart. &ldquo;I think we have much more important matters to discuss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>King Midas entered the room. &ldquo;So, we are all here? Good.&rdquo; He sat on his royal chair.</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;Father, what should we do now? I cannot wait any longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas: &ldquo;But we can nothing but wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mac: &ldquo;There has to be a way to find the Silver Crystal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neb: &ldquo;Well, we can&rsquo;t find it if it&rsquo;s in another dimension. Vega is smart, so it probably is hidden well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True, true.&rdquo; Mac said.</p>

<p>Midas entered the room. He gasped when he saw himself sitting on his seat. &ldquo;What is the meaning of this?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everybody looked at him and became shocked. &ldquo;What? Two King Midas&rsquo;s?&rdquo; cried Nebula.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a fake!&rdquo; said the one sitting down. &ldquo;Can you not see that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he is a fake!&rdquo; said the one standing up.</p>

<p>Derik: &ldquo;Which one is real?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Acelot: &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be...shape shifters actually exist?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;Shape shifters?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Acelot: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only heard about them in rumors. They are demons who take the form of people - or more precisely, the ones that you love, and they kill you. They&rsquo;re the nastiest of the demons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;Shape shifters? There is a method to tell them apart from the real thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mac: &ldquo;Like what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;They can take a person&rsquo;s form, but not their memories. The logical step to take is to question both of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no problem with that.&rdquo; said the second Midas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So be it.&rdquo; said the first Midas.</p>

<p>Acelot went up to the second Midas and stared at him in the eye. &ldquo;At what age did I run away from home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were ten years old then. You were fed up and left without saying a word, leaving me only a note.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Acelot: &ldquo;Correct.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derik went up to the first Midas. &ldquo;Your highness. At what age was your daughter when she discovered she can heal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy. It happened when she was eleven years old in the month of April. She found a rabbit in the gardens and healed it out of sympathy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith pounded her palm as she recalls the memory. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derik: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have to ask harder questions. Both of you...as of today...is Tyson older than Faith? Think carefully before you answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; answered the second Midas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; answered the first. &ldquo;My daughter was eighteen when they met. Tyson was twenty years old.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a dead silence in the room. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong.&rdquo; Derik said to the sitting down Midas.</p>

<p>His eyes grew wide open. &ldquo;Wrong?&rdquo; (How can that be? I am sure that all of my data is correct! Wait, is there some kind of trick to the question I don&rsquo;t know about?)</p>

<p>Derik: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you for not knowing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;One time me and Tyson went on a spaceship to Planet C-16 but on the way we were caught in a black hole. As a result, we were sent five years into the future. So technically speaking, Tyson is younger than Faith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? You survived a black hole?!&rdquo; The fake Midas nearly jumped out of his chair.</p>

<p>Derik: &ldquo;Of course, that technicality was revealed only recently. So no matter how much research you&rsquo;ve done, there&rsquo;s no way you would&rsquo;ve found out. And the fact that you are so surprised by this gives it away. Therefore you are the imposter!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly, the fake Midas laughed. He transformed into a shadow and</p>

<p>grabbed Derik and lifted him to the air. &ldquo;Aahhhh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neb: &ldquo;Oh shit!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alpha: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have time to play pop quiz. It&rsquo;s time to die mortal fools.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace punched the shadow, but it did not hurt him. Alpha smacked him and he was slammed against the wall, and broke a jar. Derik screamed in agony as he was being squished. Nebula charged and slashed with his sword. He cut the shadow&rsquo;s body, but Alpha&rsquo;s body went back together, and then smacked Nebula and he fell. Alpha went to the middle of the room, still holding Derik.</p>

<p>Mac: &ldquo;What is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zell: &ldquo;No idea! But we gotta kill it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;Let him go!&rdquo; She summoned the Soul Sword and jumped and slashed Alpha&rsquo;s arm, setting Derik free. He crawled behind the column for safety.</p>

<p>Lisa: &ldquo;Watch out, no!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alpha extended a part of his body, turning it into a long rope, attacked with it. Faith jumped away.</p>

<p>Zelfire charged and punched, and his fist went through Alpha&rsquo;s body. &ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alpha: &ldquo;You cannot hurt me that easily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His fist was stuck, and Alpha grabbed him and threw him across the room. Wham.</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; He fired the Energy Bomb and hit Alpha, and his body exploded into pieces, scattering over the carpet. Neb panted for breath.</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;Is he dead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lisa: &ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They heard a laugh. Alpha&rsquo;s fragmented body came back together into one, and he stretched himself tall. &ldquo;Ha ha ha ha! Die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still alive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alpha slammed the floor, the heroes jumped away. Faith threw three roses, but they had no effect, and Alpha flexed and the roses popped away. Tyson jumped and punched, Alpha grabbed him and threw him against the column.</p>

<p>Zell: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, let&rsquo;s kill this thing for good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The heroes charged at the shadow. Alpha laughed and released a dark energy storm at them. They were all electrified by dark energy and could barely move.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aaaaaaaah!&rdquo; they screamed.</p>

<p>Marianna forced herself to load an arrow on the bow, and fell on her knees. She aimed it and her hands were trembling. Twang! The arrow hit Alpha&rsquo;s head and went through.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Argh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas: &ldquo;Everybody stay back.&rdquo; He began a chant, closing his eyes and putting on hand over his face.</p>

<p>The shadow screamed in agony as if it was suffering inside out. He got trapped in a spiritual ball and the ball floated up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alright, here goes.&rdquo; Derik said. He began to chant something and released much spirit energy.</p>

<p>The shadow faded away and let out a final scream. It was over, and the heroes were relieved.</p>

<p>Neb: &ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derik: &ldquo;Since we cannot physically destroy that shadow, there is only one thing to get rid of it for good. To banish it back to its origins - the shadow world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fay: &ldquo;That shape shifter came from the shadow world?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas: &ldquo;All shape shifters come from the shadow world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derik: &ldquo;Shape-shifters are a deadly breed of demon. Once they master the art of changing forms, they can transform into almost anything or anybody. This type of strong demon is very rare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neb: &ldquo;Exactly how did a demon get to this world?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;Yes, please explain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fay: &ldquo;They were released by Vega, no doubt. He wants us dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;So now he&rsquo;s using them to do his dirty work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derik: &ldquo;It is not over yet, I&rsquo;m afraid. There are well-known shape-shifters that are feared throughout the shadow world - the shadow brothers. Three of the strongest shape-shifters who would do anything for money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianne: &ldquo;Damn, there&rsquo;s two more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;Looks like it. They will try to get us soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neb: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not safe to go outside anymore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fay: &ldquo;Father, what do you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas touched his beard and thought for a moment. &ldquo;We should stay within the castle. It is too dangerous with the shadow brothers unleashed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Junior came from the stairs, rubbing his eyes sleepily. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; Faith said. &ldquo;Go back to your room and sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Junior: &ldquo;But what was that noise I heard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;Nothing&#8230;we were&#8230;ummm&#8230;practicing, yeah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zell: &ldquo;Yeah. Listen to your mother and get some sleep. It&rsquo;s too early to get up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on now, it&rsquo;s off to bed.&rdquo; Faith said, lightly pushing her son&rsquo;s back as he walked up the stairs. She followed him up to make sure he stays there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyways, it is a good idea to stay here.&rdquo; said Ace. &ldquo;That way, we can always be together and not be surprised by the enemy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re gonna stay here, it might be days. We need food.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lisa: &ldquo;Yeah, food.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got enough food for all of us&#8230;for one day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lisa: &ldquo;Not enough. We need more. Who&rsquo;s going to buy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nobody answered. They just looked at each other.</p>

<p>Then Tyson spoke up. &ldquo;If you are scared, I will go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neb: &ldquo;Well, since you want to go, alright.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lisa: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mac: &ldquo;Lees, it&rsquo;s too dangerous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m an expert in shopping. Besides, I can get the stuff we need faster. I&rsquo;ll be fine with Tyson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her friends hesitated, but then agreed. &ldquo;Alright, be back as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will. Let&rsquo;s go Tyke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The street was quiet in the afternoon. The nearest supermarkets were in the slums of the city. This was not a pleasant place to go to, especially if you owe money to a loan shark. As Tyson and Lisa were walking, they came across some people arguing in front of them.</p>

<p>There was a ragged man lying on the street, two men in black suits were apparently beating him. One of them had glasses, and he was kicking the poor man. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s our money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I d-don&rsquo;t have it yet. Please, give me a few more days!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No money?&rdquo; He stepped on the guy&rsquo;s stomach. &ldquo;You know how it goes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please&#8230;I have a family to feed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lisa: &ldquo;We have to help him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s the right thing to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lisa approached them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you looking at, missy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you let the poor man go?&rdquo; Lisa demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No can&rsquo;t do. He owes us big time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man got up. &ldquo;I can repay you. Just give me time, please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just go away.&rdquo; said the second black suit man.</p>

<p>Lisa: &ldquo;He said he&rsquo;ll return the money. Why don&rsquo;t you leave him alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thug A: &ldquo;Miss, this is really none of your business. Why don&rsquo;t you go away before you get hurt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson came in front of Lisa. She let out a confident laugh. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t lay a finger on me. Because I have him. Teach them a lesson, Tyson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thug A came towards Tyson and grabbed him by the collar. &ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re a tough guy, eh? We eat punks like you for breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson looked at him with dead eyes. He grabbed his hand and squeezed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aaarrgh!&rdquo; Thug A could hear his bones cracking.</p>

<p>Tyson jabbed him in the guts. Pow. He fell backwards. B took out a pocket knife and charged. Tyson dodged the knife, then punched the guy&rsquo;s face, then kicked him down. He grabbed the guy, lifting his feet off the ground, and strangled him. The loan shark was struggling for his life, and Tyson remained still, with his grip strong. The ragged man saw the chance and ran away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough.&rdquo; Lisa warned.</p>

<p>Tyson ignored her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough! Put him down!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson dropped him. The loan shark coughed and grabbed his neck, then crawled backwards. He and his partner ran away.<br>  Lisa: &ldquo;You could have killed him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So? You&rsquo;re not supposed to kill him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You said teach them a lesson. And I obeyed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I did not mean kill him. Tyson, even if they are bastards, it is still wrong to take a life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you spare his life? Is he worth living in this world? Do you feel compassion for that man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lisa sighed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hopeless explaining. Let&rsquo;s just go.&rdquo; They continued walking, with Lisa in the front. (Tyke&#8230;you&rsquo;ve changed so much&#8230;and I don&rsquo;t like the way you are. It&rsquo;s scaring me.)</p>

<p>As Vega was draining energy from the Silver Crystal, he was thinking of his future. All over his body wires were attached, and those wires were plugged into various parts of the crystal. Little specs of life energy went into him, and he was glowing red.</p>

<p>Ahh, the future. What will hold the future? It will definitely be glorious, unlike his shameful past. He could just imagine right there a world without love, without any good emotions at all. People would obey him and only him, the supreme ruler of not one, not two, but three worlds. The future would be an ideal world (his ideal world), his vision of a utopia.</p>

<p>A glowing figure of a person appeared. His details were not seen for he was covered by a white light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8230;it is you, Overlord.&rdquo; Vega said, startled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who else could it be other than me? I am disappointed, Vega. You still have not succeeded so far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will. Just give me time.&rdquo; Vega replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first shadow brother was banished. I am sure you are already aware of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never asked them to do it alone. Besides, that is only a minor setback. The brothers are only a distraction to my main plan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well. I will continue trusting you for now. But be aware, these earthlings are not ignorant about the shadow world.&rdquo; He disappeared.</p>

<p>Junior just woke up. His mother was watching him from the chair the whole time. &ldquo;Mommy, is that bad man Vega alive? Is he going to kill us all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no point in avoiding the topic. He has already seen Vega and some horrible stuff he shouldn&rsquo;t have seen. How could she keep him as ignorant as possible and not seem like to keep the truth from him? It&rsquo;s so hard being a mother of a curious child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, of course not.&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Everyone we know is very strong. They&rsquo;ll protect us. There is nothing to worry about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Honest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Honest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly, a black rope-like substance broke through the window and grabbed Junior by his neck, and dragged him out the window, pulling him to the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!!&rdquo; Faith screamed. She reached for her son, but was not fast enough. She leaped out the window, drawing her sword in the air.</p>

<p>The shadow shape-shifter Beta laughed.</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;Let him go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beta: &ldquo;Ahahahahaha! You want your precious little boy back, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; He put his face to Junior&rsquo;s, and the kid was moaning for breath. &ldquo;You want him back, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith grunted angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; He tossed the kid into the air.</p>

<p>Faith jumped up and caught him. She landed, and realized that tentacles surrounded her. &ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna showed up and slashed the tentacles and Beta screamed in pain. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of Junior! I&rsquo;ll get the others here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; She jumped to the trees to lure the shadow away from the castle.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tyson and Lisa were returning with groceries. Tyson stopped all of a sudden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Lisa asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can sense Faith is in danger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is? Then what are you waiting for? Go help her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?! Because she&rsquo;s your wife damn it! Go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson dropped the groceries and ran into the trees.</p>

<p>Faith jumped from tree to tree, dodging Beta&rsquo;s attacks. He slashed the branches as obstacles in the way, even breaking down trees. Suddenly, one of Beta&rsquo;s tentacles grabbed Faith&rsquo;s foot and dragged her down. &ldquo;Oof!&rdquo; she said as she fell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prepare to say goodbye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodbye to yourself!&rdquo; She cut the tentacles, setting herself free, and jumped to a safer distance.</p>

<p>Beta bent his body, and many extensions, shaped like thick ropes, charged at Faith and tied up her limbs. &ldquo;Now I have you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, my body can change into whatever I want. Even a solid object.&rdquo; He turned his hand into an axe, and it looked like a real one, , with a silver shine. The color of his arm changed from black to gray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahhhhh!&rdquo; Faith screamed in fear.</p>

<p>Beta chopped, Faith could barely move her hands, but she managed to block it with the sword. Twang! She threw a rose at Beta&rsquo;s eye. Stab! &ldquo;Arrrrrgh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith was free and she slashed Beta in half. But his body became one again. &ldquo;What does it take to kill you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get it, do you? You <strong>can&rsquo;t</strong> kill me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith slashed, Beta vanished, appearing in the trees. Faith fired an energy ball, and Beta jumped to another tree. Boom! A tentacle hit Faith&rsquo;s stomach and knocked her down. &ldquo;Oof!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Neb and Zell were playing cards, thinking carefully, they sensed danger. &ldquo;Do you feel that presence?&rdquo; Nebula asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah. We better act quickly.&rdquo; They dropped the cards and got up.</p>

<p>Lisa burst in, panting for breath. &ldquo;Faith is&#8230;Faith is&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Attacked by a shadow?&rdquo; Zell asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry&#8230;I&rsquo;ll go tell Acelot and Marianna.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace was nervous as Marianna entered his room. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&#8230;&rdquo; he said, scratching his head and not knowing what to say. &ldquo;I have something to show you&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ummm&#8230;&rdquo; He reached for the desk.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Lisa came in, slamming the door open. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re under attack!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Immediately, Ace forgot about it. They left the room and ran downstairs.</p>

<p>Beta transformed his arm into a sharp sword and pointed it at Faith. &ldquo;Die Princess of Almerak. This is your death day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Tyson yelled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You interfere you die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tyson, watch out!&rdquo; Faith yelled worriedly.</p>

<p>Beta slashed and Tyson jumped backwards, his tentacles broke the ground. Bam. Beta slashed again. Tyson jumped into the trees. Beta slashed all the trees in the way, and Tyson flew to the air. The ropes grabbed his limbs and dragged him down. &ldquo;Uhh!&rdquo; Tyson powered up, charging blue energy, and the tentacles touching him were burned to ashes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You die!&rdquo; Beta turned his arm into a sharp stone and dived it at his target. Tyson jumped away, avoiding a fatal blow.</p>

<p>Faith jumped and slashed, and Beta whipped her away. Wham. Tyson charged and used the Power Punch, but the shadow, with a flexible body, dodged his fist, and slammed him away. Tyson ran deeper into the trees, and as he looked behind, the shadow was chasing him. Tyson jumped away, rolled and landed on his knee. The shadow was gone - where did he go?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God you&rsquo;re alright, Tyson!&rdquo; said the voice of Faith. She came out from the dark part of the woods and ran to him and opened her arms. Tyson refused the embrace. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; she asked, disappointed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not Faith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about, silly? Who else would I be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You trick is not working on me.&rdquo; He suddenly punched Faith in the guts, and she suddenly turned to black slime. He grabbed her neck, but the she slithered away like oil, and went back a few feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is not right! You should have fallen for that.&rdquo; Beta said angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a fool if you think you can fool me, shape-shifter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arrrgh! You should be confused with emotions. That trick should have worked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a different Tyson now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beta stretched himself over seven feet tall, and his arms were razor blades. &ldquo;Different?! I will show you a different you - a dead body!&rdquo; He charged, head facing down.</p>

<p>Tyson extended his right arm and fired a blue blast of energy - bam. The shadow was blown into pieces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;AAAAAAHHH!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: (Wow&#8230;Tyson is a lot stronger than before. I guess the head band does have its advantages.)</p>

<p>Not in sight, Derik lingered behind the trees, leaning on a trunk to rest.</p>

<p>Faith joined Tyson. &ldquo;Tyson, are you alright?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am fine. No need to be worried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beta groaned. &ldquo;Did you think you could kill me?&rdquo; His body became one again, and he stretched himself to five feet. He whipped a rope at them - and they jumped away.</p>

<p>Faith threw a rose at Beta&rsquo;s body, which did no good. But then the rose grew into huge vines and the thorns pinched him painfully, and his body was severed. &ldquo;Arrrgh!&rdquo; Just then, the fragments became one, and he was back together, as quick as he had fallen apart.</p>

<p>He slammed Faith against a tree. Tyson charged and jumped, and the ropes grabbed his legs and pulled him down. Wham. His arms and legs were tied. He struggled desperately. &ldquo;Your time is up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly, he transformed to Super Sayan and the ropes touching him were disintegrated. Tyson punched Beta&rsquo;s face. Pow. He unleashed a super combo of fists, punching several times a second.</p>

<p>Faith: (He can go Super Sayan&#8230;even in his state?)</p>

<p>They continued to battle, and Tyson once again smashed Beta into pieces. Derik showed up, and performed his banishment chant. Beta moaned in agony as he was being sent to the shadow world, and disappeared in a bright light. Flash, zap.</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;That is two down, and one to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;Thank goodness you are here Derik. Your timing was just right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had to be more aware, of course, being the only one who can get rid of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sure said it.&rdquo; Faith said, smiling.</p>

<p>After defeating the second shape-shifter, the heroes became at ease. These shape-shifters are very powerful and they can transform into almost anything - changing body shapes, colors, and even mimicking people&rsquo;s voices. But as demonstrated by the fake Midas, they cannot copy memories, so identifying them will be a cinch. Only one of the shadow brothers remain, the most cunning and strongest one, so what does he have planned for our heroes?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you are ready for this?&rdquo; Zelfire said, making a serious face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always ready to take you on.&rdquo; Nebula replied, confident as usual. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to regret challenging me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heh, you&rsquo;re fifteen years too early to beat me. Well, you gonna go or what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula was sweating and frowning. &ldquo;Are you sure? Don&rsquo;t regret it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t got all day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you what I got!&rdquo; Nebula yelled.</p>

<p>*Plop!* <br>  Nebula slammed his cards down, screaming, &ldquo;Take this: full house, baby!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! Four aces.&rdquo; Zell threw them on top of Neb&rsquo;s cards.</p>

<p>Nebula jumped out of his seat. &ldquo;No! No! Nooooooo!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I win.&rdquo; Zell grabbed the chips, pulling them to his side. He noticed Nebula only had a few chips left. &ldquo;Heh. You lose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arrrgh&#8230;best two out of three.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re on. I shovel, you deal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Faith and Midas were talking in the basement. A lot has happened in the past few months, and they never had a chance to have a father-daughter talk. Midas was more interested in Junior&rsquo;s life, and he asked her about how Junior is doing in school and what kind of hobbies he has.</p>

<p>In another part of the castle, the new couple was alone in the third floor. Ace took Marianna into his room again, and this time, he did not want any interruptions.</p>

<p>He was nervous all over again, even though he promised himself not to be. His heart was racing.</p>

<p>Marianna leaned on the closed door. &ldquo;So, what was it that you wanted to show me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ummm errr, well&#8230;.ummm&#8230;.uhhhh&rdquo; He took the small box and went over to her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s j-just a ummm&#8230;you know, small present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She took it and opened it. Her eyes glittered and she gasped. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s beautiful!&rdquo; She held the necklace above to look at it from another angle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You like it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course!!&rdquo; Marianna smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad.&rdquo; He smiled.</p>

<p>Suddenly, they heard sounds from the closet. *Thump, thump* Ace opened the closet door. He was dumbfounded and open-mouthed as he saw his sister inside, tied up. Her mouth was taped shut up to prevent making any sounds. She fell down.</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;Oh my God! Fay? You okay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>All she could do was moan. Marianna pulled out the tape from her mouth. &ldquo;I was attacked by a shape-shifter!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute&#8230;if you&rsquo;re up here, then who&rsquo;s down there with his majesty&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh my God!&rdquo; He ran down the stairs. A loud cry was heard from downstairs. &ldquo;Father!&rdquo; Ace yelled.</p>

<p>Marianna quickly untied her friend, and they rushed down.</p>

<p>When the three got there, the third shadow brother was tying up the king, lifting him off his feet. &ldquo;Ahhh!&rdquo; the king screamed.</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;Put him down!&rdquo; He drew the sword and attacked.</p>

<p>Omega waited for him to come, and whacked him away with his long arm. Smack! He fell on the floor on his side. Faith threw a rose at Omega, and he responded by blasting it. Marianna shot an arrow and hit the shadow&rsquo;s chest. He just stuck out his chest, and the arrow fell off him. &ldquo;Ha ha ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly, Ace was in the air, and he slashed his tentacles, freeing the king.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Noooo!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;Run father!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas ran, and then turned around. &ldquo;My son!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Acelot fought the shadow bravely, but Omega broke his sword. Crack. Ace was hit and knocked down.</p>

<p>Faith and Marianna charged, as Omega stretched his arms and grabbed them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uugh!&rdquo; they moaned.</p>

<p>Zell and Neb came down the stairs from the opposite side and were surprised to see the current mess. &ldquo;Another one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Omega: &ldquo;You all die! This is for banishing my brothers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zell and Neb gathered energy and fired a beam. Bam. Omega dodged them and his body flattened on the floor. He spread like water spilling, going under everybody.</p>

<p>Zell: &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Omega: &ldquo;My body can spread over a mile! There is no escape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tentacles from the black liquid grabbed the heroes, trapping them, limiting their movements. They struggled desperately.</p>

<p>Tyson and Derik came down from the stairs. &ldquo;They are in trouble.&rdquo; Derik said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the last shape-shifter.&rdquo; Tyson did a flying kick and Omega transformed into a giant rock man, and Tyson kicked his chest, but it had no effect.</p>

<p>The rock man pounded his fists and roared. He slammed his fist on the floor, Tyson and Derik jumped away.</p>

<p>Derik started the banishment chant, closing his eyes and remaining still.</p>

<p>Omega: &ldquo;Oh no you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; He attacked before Derik could finish. Derik ran to the side.</p>

<p>Tyson jumped and used the Power Punch - bam. The rock man was smashed into pieces, and turned back to black slime.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everybody was free, and they all attacked him. Wham! Whack! Pow! Omega made himself flat on the floor, and slipped away.</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;He is escaping!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;After him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The heroes chased after the slithering slime. Omega went up the stairs, through the hallways, and out the main entrance into the grass, then the trees.</p>

<p>The heroes lost sight of him.</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;Damn, where is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zell: &ldquo;He must be hiding somewhere. We have to find him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neb: &ldquo;This is annoying. Where could he be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t have gone far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The heroes searched carefully, but found no trace of the creature, nor could they sense him.</p>

<p>Acelot searched near the trees, hoping to find a trail or something. Suddenly, the tree behind began to move. Its branches grabbed him and choked him. &ldquo;Aaaaah!&rdquo; he screamed.</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;He is there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;Let him go, vile demon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Omega: &ldquo;At least one of you will die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Three arrows hit the tree&rsquo;s head. Chop, chop, chop. The tree turned into black slime and threw Ace on the ground. The heroes charged. Macintosh used his shockwave on Omega and he screamed in agony. Zzzzap! Nebula, Zelfire, Tyson, and Ace blasted the shadow with their beams, keeping him fried. Derik mumbled the banishment chant and Omega was sucked into the air piece by piece. A vortex appeared above, and his body pieces were sucked into it, and when he was completely gone, the vortex vanished with a flash.</p>

<p>Zell: &ldquo;Good job, Derik.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derik: &ldquo;It was nothing, you guys.&rdquo; His chest hurt and he moaned.</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t have beaten the shadow brothers without you. You sure saved us. We must be in luck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the least I could do to repay for what you have given me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;Finally, we are safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neb: &ldquo;I knew it all along. Vega can send his goons to kill us, but nothing will work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once again, the heroes became relaxed and carefree, knowing that the shadow brothers will not bother them for a long time, probably forever.</p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="4">4: Worlds Collide </span></p></center>

<p>The mysterious glowing being known as the Overlord appeared in Vega&rsquo;s room. &ldquo;Looks like you failed. I am disappointed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said the arrogant tyrant. &ldquo;The shadow brothers were morons! I told them to attack together, but they were overconfident and they operated alone!</p>

<p>Because of that they are banished. If it wasn&rsquo;t for Derik that traitor&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is also your fault he switched sides.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That brat will give in to the curse soon enough. The brothers were just a distraction. I have absorbed much energy from their battle, and now the Silver Crystal is full.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might be wrong about you.&rdquo; the Overlord said in a different tone. &ldquo;You are smarter than you look.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The final merger is about to begin. Once it is done, we will see who is victorious! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith and Tyson could not sleep in peace back at their own house. Although for Faith, things were boring without the normal Tyson, she and her son were still trying to live happily. It was better than nothing. One day, he will be back to normal, she thought. And this thought kept her hopes up.</p>

<p>Junior woke up and rubbed his eyes. It was very late at night, but he could not sleep. He looked out the window, and became shocked at what he saw. He jumped out the window, landed on grass, and went to the field to take a better look at the sky. He gasped and his legs trembled. &ldquo;Mom, dad!&rdquo; he yelled, running to the living room.</p>

<p>Faith moaned and woke up. &ldquo;What is it? Can&rsquo;t sleep?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson got up while she left the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, hon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sky is changing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous. How can that happen? Were you dreaming?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I swear. Look.&rdquo; He led her outside. Tyson followed them, being curious. Faith was still with shock. &ldquo;Oh my lord! This&#8230;c-can&rsquo;t be&#8230; happening&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emerging from the clouds was a gigantic piece of land &ndash; a land as big as the sky itself. Its eerie shaped buildings were dark and tall, and looked like miniatures from this far away. They stared at the sky.</p>

<p>Lisa was rudely awakened by the phone. She put on her night gown and got off the bed. &ldquo;What the heck? Who could it be?&rdquo; She picked up the phone. &ldquo;Hello? Macintosh? Do you know what time it is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please just look at the sky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; She pushed the curtains aside, and gasped as what she saw. &ldquo;Oh my God?&rdquo; She dropped the phone. &ldquo;Is this an illusion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>  Midas: &ldquo;The ill-omen&#8230;this is the sign&#8230;of the ultimate test aforementioned in the Sacred Scrolls&#8230;nobody knows what will happen beyond this point&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;Father&#8230;will we all be doomed?! Please tell me?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas: &ldquo;Your fate and the fate of three worlds depend on you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianne: &ldquo;Fate of three worlds&#8230;&rdquo;<br> </p>

<p>Vega was on a rooftop, proudly watching the sky. &ldquo;Ha ha ha ha ha! It has finally come! The day of judgment is here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The heroes gathered together at Network City, where the view of the city in the sky was best. The city&rsquo;s citizens were scared beyond their imaginations. They just watched stupidly, wondering what this means.</p>

<p>Derik: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s starting sooner than I thought. We&rsquo;re not ready for this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sun came out, but the city was dark, covered by the sky city&rsquo;s shadow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is not happening&#8230;&rdquo; Faith whined, grabbing her head.</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;Is this&#8230;the end of everything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The heroes, now in the city, standing in the middle of street, stared at the sky dumbfounded. The city in the sky, better known as the shadow world, was now seen by almost everybody.</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;What does this mean&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;This is&#8230;the shadow world that we feared so much&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;What now&#8230;what happens now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The heroes, consumed by fear and shock, wondered if this was the end of the world. What was happening was beyond their wildest imaginations. Yet they have to accept the reality of it, for doomsday has come, and they are staring straight at it.</p>

<p>The shadow world was as big as the actual earth, and they could see the small buildings. Most of the details were covered by clouds, but as the shadow world grows closer, more of it can be seen.</p>

<p>But the appearance of the shadow world is not the worst part. The worst part is what is about to happen - a merger with the shadow world. This is Vega&rsquo;s ultimate plan. First, to merge two dimensions together into one. And finally, merge the new dimension with the shadow dimension, creating a new world - one that is run by fear, darkness, and pure evil.</p>

<p>Derik: &ldquo;So&#8230;this is the shadow world&#8230;the place where nightmares originate, as well as the scum of the earth...&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;I would never have believed it until I saw it with my own eyes&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;My father&#8230;and many other people talked about it...I didn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;d be real...&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zelfire: &ldquo;Guys, tell me this is a dream. It&rsquo;s all a bad dream!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad dream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zelfire: &ldquo;Pinch me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula punched his face. *Pow*</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ouch. I said pinch me, not punch me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Same thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mac: &ldquo;Science cannot explain this phenomenon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Acelot: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right...this is way beyond science and comprehension.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;We have better things than to worry about it. We have to find Vega, which is, as you say, our enemy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mac: &ldquo;And we gotta find the Silver Crystal. Vega is going to use it to merge the shadow world with our world. Once that happens, then it&rsquo;s <strong>really</strong> the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mayor of the city was as shocked as anyone was. He was on the phone while looking at the sky. He pulled the shades so he could look clearly. &ldquo;&#8230;Yes&#8230;yes&#8230;I know, Mr. President&#8230;yes, I see it too&#8230;It has to be some kind of illusion&#8230;Probably Some prankster&#8230;someone really good&#8230;&rdquo; He sighed and sat down. &ldquo;I will look into it.&rdquo; He hung up. He folded his hands on laid his chin on them. &ldquo;Oh God&#8230;what is happening?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the castle, Junior never took his eyes off the sky. &ldquo;Grandfather, what is going to happen to us?&rdquo; he asked, hoping for an answer that he liked.</p>

<p>Lisa was not as calm as the others. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the end of the world, isn&rsquo;t it?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas was silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m right, am I? This is the end?&rdquo; asked Lisa. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve never even married! There&rsquo;s so many things I didn&rsquo;t do. I don&rsquo;t want to die so young!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have faith, young one.&rdquo; Midas said. &ldquo;They have not let us down, have they? It is up to them to save the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Save the world?&rdquo; Junior repeated blankly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whenever there is darkness, there is light of equal power. That is a truism of the universe.&rdquo; said Midas. &ldquo;Whether or not the light will shine through the darkness, it is up to us to believe in them. For us to watch from the sidelines, it is all we can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;Hey guys, are we just gonna stand here all day, or are we going to do something about it?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zelfire: &ldquo;Yeah, Nebula is right. This is our planet earth. We can&rsquo;t just let him do what he wants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derik: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! We&rsquo;ll get him if it&rsquo;s the last thing we do! We have to go to the shadow world!&rdquo;<br>  Macintosh: &ldquo;Yeah! I&rsquo;m with you guys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;So sis, this is it. We can&rsquo;t afford to lose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;Yes, this ends now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zell: &ldquo;Come on guys, let&rsquo;s do it for earth!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mac: &ldquo;This will conclude what we started seven years ago!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everybody got in a circle and put their hands together, and the last person to do it was Tyson. Then they let go and screamed &ldquo;Yeah!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neb, being the most impatient one, flew to the sky, and the others followed.</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;Come on, Tyson!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He listened and flew after them.</p>

<p>They went higher and higher, and turned into sparkles in the sky. They went through several layers of clouds. They could see they were getting closer.</p>

<p>Vega: &ldquo;Fools. If they want to commit suicide, then let them! Who would want to enter the shadow world?&rdquo;<br>  &ldquo;Do not forget that the Silver Crystal is hidden there. You know what happens if they find it.&rdquo; Overlord warned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will not happen. I will see to it myself.&rdquo; Vega walked into the darkness.</p>

<p>The heroes landed on the shadow world, and things seemed completely different. The earth was now above them, partly blocked by moving clouds. This place had old, even ancient buildings. The land itself was like part of a giant palace, made of marble, but it was old and cracked and dusty. It was quiet, very quiet&#8230;</p>

<p>Zell: &ldquo;So this is the shadow world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s creepy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zell: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange&#8230;looking at the earth above us. Isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neb: &ldquo;Yes, from this angle it is different. We are now in a different world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derik: &ldquo;I am sensing strange spirit energies here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everybody looked around, and there was dead silence.</p>

<p>Neb: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel a thing. What about you, Tyson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;I feel it. But I don&rsquo;t know what it is. It&rsquo;s giving me chills.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s this place, I&rsquo;m telling ya. We better get a move on it. The demons might be coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With Ace leading the way, the heroes began walking in a random direction (forward). As always, they walked with caution. A demon might pop out from any corner, from the above, and sometimes below. They know that, especially Faith and Derik. Demons rarely ever attack directly.</p>

<p>Suddenly, they heard a noise.</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;Look!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Demons were in front of them, and they came in all shapes and sizes. &ldquo;Hehehehe look at these humans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So Vega wants us to kill these humans?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be so easy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;God, do they have to be so ugly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;Heh. Maybe that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re stuck in the shadow world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humans, you dare insult us?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s teach them a lesson!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith summoned her Soul Swords. &ldquo;Vile demons, it is you who insult us with your presence!&rdquo; She and the others charged into the mob of demons. Slash! Slash! Chop! Blood splattered in the air.</p>

<p>Ace attacked like he never did in his life, killing three or four demons in a minute. Derik and Macintosh stayed behind. Tyson blasted any demon that came near him.</p>

<p>The demons screamed like hell as they were killed. The bloody fight was soon over, with body parts all over the place. None of the heroes were seriously hurt.</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;Everybody ok?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all fine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good. Let&rsquo;s keep going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They continued walking in that direction.</p>

<p>Vega: &ldquo;Ha. They will not get far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Overlord: &ldquo;They just destroyed all those demons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like I said, I will see to it myself they will not succeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;So, this is the place where all demons originate?&rdquo; Mac asked as they were walking.</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;Yes. They are supposed to be confined here, but occasionally there will be a leak between the shadow world and our world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zelfire: &ldquo;How do you know all this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;Our dimension was different, as you know. It was more dangerous. We had to be knowledgeable about these things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mac: &ldquo;Now that the dimensions are one, it means the demons can escape to our world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neb: &ldquo;This is terrible. If the demons are released&#8230;chaos will happen.&rdquo; <br>  Derik: &ldquo;That is why we are here. If we can stop the merger in time&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop the merger? Ha. Don&rsquo;t make me laugh.&rdquo; said a voice from above.</p>

<p>Everybody looked up. Vega was standing on a tower, calm and ready to kill. His cape waved from the wind.</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;Vega!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vega: &ldquo;It is time for retribution!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neb: &ldquo;Retribution for what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For all the sins of mankind!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mac: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that what you&rsquo;re doing can cause the world to crumble? Is that what you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I want the shadow world to become part of the earth. Yes, there is a chance that everything will be destroyed. It is an acceptable risk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derik: &ldquo;Acceptable risk?!! You&rsquo;re insane!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vega: &ldquo;Ahh, I see you&rsquo;re enjoying the curse, are you not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derik: &ldquo;Shut up! The only thing that&rsquo;s a curse is your existence!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha ha! Simpletons. People like you would never understand my goals, my ambition, my vision of an ideal world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;Ideal world? Give me a break! That could never happen.&rdquo; She shot an arrow at him. He vanished. *Flash!*</p>

<p>Vega appeared behind Zelfire, and knocked him into the wall. Wham. Everybody was shocked he was so fast. Nebula charged and punched, and Vega dodged. *Whoosh whoosh* Nebula punched in vain. He got kicked in the chin and fell backwards.</p>

<p>Macintosh fired the shockwave, and Vega blocked it, splitting it into two.</p>

<p>Vega charged lightning fast and kicked Mac in the stomach, pushing him into a wall. *Crash*</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;Your day has come!&rdquo; She put her ki into the arrow, and shouted &ldquo;Celestial Arrow!&rdquo; Twang. She released it and it went at him like a comet. It stabbed his chest and he screamed.</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s hit!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arrrrgh!&rdquo; He pulled out the arrow and turned it to dust. &ldquo;You think that will kill me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace and Faith charged side by side and attacked. They slashed from both sides, Vega blurred. Zip! He appeared behind Faith and kicked her into a building. Ace flew up and slashed, but he missed and was knocked down.</p>

<p>Derik, with his hand over his heart, stood in front of Faith. Vega approached.</p>

<p>Derik: &ldquo;Wait, don&rsquo;t do this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vega smacked him away. Wham. Faith moaned unconsciously. Tyson landed in front of him.</p>

<p>They faced each other. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the only one left. I am going to enjoy killing you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t scare me.&rdquo; Tyson turned Super Sayan and charged like a bull. He prepared his fist, drawing it back, as his feet hit the ground - thud, thud, thud.</p>

<p>Vega dodged it, and Tyson kept attacking. Vega soared to the air and Tyson followed. They hit on the elbows, then backed off. Tyson powered up and charged as Vega gathered energy. Bam! He released a beam and smashed into Tyson, pushing him into a wall. Wham</p>

<p>Tyson came out, and the expression on his face was the same.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am impressed. You have improved beyond my expectations, Tyson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it is all thanks to the curse you gave me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh? Then you should thank me!&rdquo; He shot triple tentacles at Tyson. Bang!</p>

<p>Tyson grabbed them with his fingers, holding them tightly and pulling. Vega shot tentacles from the other hand &ndash; bang! Tyson ducked.</p>

<p>Faith crawled up from the ground. &ldquo;Ty&#8230;Tyson&#8230;he might be able to win.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Super Sayan dodged Vega&rsquo;s energy balls, and countered with a super kick. Wham. Vega landed on one knee. &ldquo;Blast! That was a lucky hit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly, Overlord appeared. &ldquo;Pathetic. You cannot even handle these earthlings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I will finish them!&rdquo; Vega said nervously. &ldquo;Just watch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no need to watch any further.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Overlord: &ldquo;I have already chosen a new ruler. One who will take your place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take my place?! Who?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is standing right in front of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8230;what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson laughed. &ldquo;Hah hah hah! Isn&rsquo;t that a big enough clue for you? It&rsquo;s obvious I have been chosen as ruler of the shadow world. It&rsquo;s too bad, Vega. That&rsquo;s how life is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;<strong>What?!</strong>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;Impossible!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson smiled maliciously. His eyes were full of evil. &ldquo;The throne of the shadow world fits me the best. It goes to the strongest. That&rsquo;s how it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vega: &ldquo;There must be some mistake. Overlord! Give me a second chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seen enough. You are out of the picture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But of all the people, it had to be him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;That is what you get for being incompetent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Overlord: &ldquo;Finish the job here.&rdquo; He vanished.</p>

<p>Vega was extremely pissed. &ldquo;How did this happen? Only I can rule this world! No other!&rdquo; He attacked ruthlessly. Tyson kicked him away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moron. Don&rsquo;t you know when you&rsquo;ve lost?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson was in a dark room, so dark not a single object was seen. Overlord appeared in front of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever you have to say, say it.&rdquo; the Sayan said in his usual rude tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to make you a proposition.&rdquo; said the Overlord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Proposition?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the thing you desire the most?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Power, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And power you shall have. However, there is always a price. I will grant your wish, if you do one thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Abandon your soul, abandon your family and everything you have. Destroy them if they interfere. If you can do this, the shadow world is yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that simple?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Think about it.&rdquo; Overlord vanished.</p>

<p>Basically, Overlord took advantage of the fact that Tyson had changed under the head band&rsquo;s influence. Seeing that his maximum power level is higher than that of Vega&rsquo;s, he decided this Sayan might make a better candidate.</p>

<p>Vega: &ldquo;No! I refuse to believe such a thing!&rdquo; Metal claws came out of his knuckles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then die in disbelief!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The killer half-man half-machine charged wildly and punched. Tyson dodged the claws and upper cut him. Whack! Vega fell on a building, then slid off and fell on the floor. Rock chunks fell on him.</p>

<p>Tyson crossed his arms. &ldquo;Oh well.&rdquo; Right now, he was at the top of the world, and he felt unstoppable.</p>

<p>Faith walked towards the building he was standing on. &ldquo;Tyson, I don&rsquo;t understand what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can it get more obvious than that? I am now the new ruler of the shadow world. It might be hard to accept, but it is a fact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Macintosh: &ldquo;I&#8230;I&rsquo;ve created a monster!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;Tell me it isn&rsquo;t true? Tell me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no denying it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;This is insane! How could this have happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna crawled up. &ldquo;And I thought it&rsquo;d be a good thing if Tyson was stronger than Vega&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Times have changed. I never felt better in my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be!! It can&rsquo;t be!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today is the dawn of a new world. A world ruled by me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vega came out from the rocks. &ldquo;I will not allow this to happen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perfect timing. Vega, I order you to finish them off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one orders <em>me</em> what to do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson sighed. &ldquo;If you want something done, do it yourself.&rdquo; He jumped down and kicked Vega into the wall. Wham. Then he approached Faith. &ldquo;You have a chance to leave. Better take it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith&rsquo;s eyes were wide-open in disbelief. &ldquo;No&#8230;no&#8230;this isn&rsquo;t you&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re right. This is the new me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want the old Tyson back! You have to snap out of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut up! From now on, I have no family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not let you do this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyone who stands in my way will die, even if it&rsquo;s you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;Be careful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson opened his palm. &ldquo;You die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t. You wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula ran and pushed her and they fell on the floor just before Tyson fired a beam. *Boom*</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you out of your mind, brother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want to get in my way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula charged angrily and punched Tyson&rsquo;s cheek. Pow! His mouth was almost pushed to the left as Nebula&rsquo;s fist was smashed into his cheek. His head turned to the side and his body lost balance, and he fell. Clump. Tyson wiped the blood off his mouth and got up.</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;Forgive me brother!&rdquo; He punched. Tyson grabbed his arms and slammed his knee into his stomach. Thud. Nebula spit painfully. Tyson whacked him on the back and he fell.</p>

<p>Faith drew her Soul Sword. &ldquo;I will not let this happen. Never. I will bring you back.&rdquo; She rushed at her husband and slashed. Tyson dodged every attack, and when he saw an opening, he punched her stomach, knocking her down.</p>

<p>Marianna gathered the last of her strength and loaded an arrow. One of her eyes was only half open, and her vision was blurry. Her face had two spots of dust. She forced herself to focus&#8230;on the target Tyson. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Tyson&#8230;this is the right thing to do.&rdquo; She concentrated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; Twang!</p>

<p>Caught off guard, Tyson titled his head and the arrow slid against the band, scratching it. He jumped away. &ldquo;Damn you! Fool!&rdquo; He fired a blast.</p>

<p>Marianna ran behind the concrete block, and it exploded and she fell down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Incompetence is rewarded with this.&rdquo; He jumped to the tallest building in the area. &ldquo;Finally, I can have what I want. To be able to control three worlds. Ahhh, there is no better feeling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Macintosh crawled up, holding on to the wall to keep from falling. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the band&#8230;it&rsquo;s been tampered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith jumped onto the building. Tyson&rsquo;s back was facing her. &ldquo;Listen, Tyson, you have to take off the band. That&rsquo;s what causing all this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You still don&rsquo;t get it, do you?&rdquo; He turned around. &ldquo;It is over. You are no longer part of my family. I am a new man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! You&rsquo;re still Tyson. I just know it. Please come back to us.&rdquo; She put her hand on her heart. &ldquo;Do you know how much it hurts to see you this way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, no.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wires came from behind and tied up Faith&rsquo;s legs. She gasped and screamed as the wires tied up her arms. She was turned upside and hung in the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahhhh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vega: &ldquo;Now, Tyson, you will listen to my demands or else she gets it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson&rsquo;s attitude was indifferent. &ldquo;Hmmph. So what? You use her to threaten me? Why should I submit to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vega was pissed. &ldquo;What was that? I am not bluffing. I will kill her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go ahead. She means nothing to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t mean that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The throne will be mine. What happens to her is none of my concern.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vega: &ldquo;Are you really going to give up on the woman you love?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith was getting scared. &ldquo;Tyson, you don&rsquo;t mean it. I know! You still love me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha. What did I tell you? He has forsaken you already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;d never do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Love is just an illusion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;Those are tough words, considering they come from someone who&rsquo;s never loved before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that is where you&rsquo;re wrong. You are very wrong. I once knew love. I was not born this way, you know. I was <em>made</em> this way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you saying?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take a close look.&rdquo; He took off his mask for the very first time to the heroes. Tyson watched with indifference. Faith was shocked. Half of his face was fine, but the other half was robotic, made of steel and computers, and he looked hideous with all those wires.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y-You&rsquo;re human?&rdquo;</p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="5">5: Overload</span></p></center> 

<p>&ldquo;I was human once. But one fateful event changed my life forever&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A man dressed in ragged clothes and a cape came out of the wooden house, entering the grass field. Hearing sounds of a horse carriage, he became excited and ran to the road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I was young, I had experienced what you call &lsquo;love.&rsquo; I was in love with this woman from the kingdom&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The carriage stopped and the horse whined. The door opened and Elinora came out. She was a beautiful woman with blonde hair and green eyes. Lord Vegus smiled as she came out, and she smiled with him. He took her hand and helped her get down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were, you could say, deeply in love.&rdquo; Vega can recall fond memories of him and Elinora together, and the happy memories. even reflected in his voice.</p>

<p>The couple sat on the grass, laughing and smiling, and time passed quicker than expected. Butterflies flew around the field, and the sky was clear blue. The woman brushed her hair and she was laughing heartily. Vegus smiled at her, admiring her beautiful laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At that time in my life, I was really happy. We were so happy together, and I did not have a care in the world. I thought at that time, my life was full of meaning, and everything was set for me. How wrong I was&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meet me in town square tomorrow, okay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will be there, I promise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alright. Be on time.&rdquo; She went into the carriage, and waved goodbye.</p>

<p>Vegus waved, watching the carriage go down the long road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That bitch was planning to betray me. I had no idea&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vegus&rsquo;s own personal horse carriage took him to time square the next morning. He was very excited to meet Elinora. She was going to make an important announcement to him, and to him, it was more important than their first meeting. His heart was thumping heavily as he waited patiently.</p>

<p>The carriage stopped abruptly, and he looked out the window. &ldquo;What is happening?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two soldiers stood in front of the horse. The horse man was silent. Vegus exited and confronted them angrily. &ldquo;I demand to know what is going on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, you are Vegus?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Lord Vegus to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The soldiers pointed their swords at him. &ldquo;Hand over your device.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My device? What for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quietly hand it over and nobody gets hurt. You&rsquo;re smart, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hand over my life&rsquo;s work? In your dreams!&rdquo; Vegus drew his sword.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You chose the hard way.&rdquo; said Soldier A.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t like killing people, you know?&rdquo; said Soldier B. They charged at him. Vegus charged and slashed, killing them both.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither do I.&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>An archer was waiting from a tower, aiming at his target. Now is the perfect chance. He released the arrow, and it hit Vegus&rsquo;s shoulder. *Stab* Blood squirted and he moaned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blast!&rdquo; Vegus ran away, pulling out the arrow and grabbing his wound. He ran into Lady Elinora, who was standing beside another man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elinora?&rdquo; he said, kind of surprised.</p>

<p>Arthur: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to put you out of your misery.&rdquo; He approached with a sword.</p>

<p>Vegus: &ldquo;Elinora, what is going on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elinora: &ldquo;Finish him off quickly, prince. I do not want this to be long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arthur: &ldquo;As you wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elinora, what is happening?&rdquo; he asked stupidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think&rdquo; she said, and the laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You poor, poor, na&iuml;ve man. Did you really think Elinora would like some one like you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elinora&#8230;you said you loved me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have to be kidding. The only thing I wanted was your inventions. Once we get it, you are useless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No...this cannot be true!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elinora and Prince Arthur laughed at his misfortune. He was on the ground, bleeding from the wound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why...Elinora...why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You fool! Did you really think I loved you? Face the truth. You have no money and no power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is right. You will learn one day, that power and money are everything.&rdquo; said the Arthur.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nooooo!!!&rdquo; screamed the victim. He was heart-broken and shocked.</p>

<p>Arthur hit him with his sword. *Chop!* He saw a pool of blood...his own blood. His vision was blinded by red&#8230;Vegus became unconscious.</p>

<p>Arthur fell on his knees, dropping the sword. He glared at his bloody hands. &ldquo;I killed someone. I actually killed someone&#8230;&rdquo; His hands were trembling and his voice was shaky.</p>

<p>Elinora grabbed his shoulder, trying to comfort him. &ldquo;What had to be done was done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He got up and ran to the alley between two buildings, and she followed. He turned on the faucet on the wall and washed his hands, and then splashed his face. He panted for breath. &ldquo;I killed a person&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing to worry about. We planned this all along, did we not?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a prince, remember? This can be covered so easily. And we have his inventions. Our future is ensured.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. Oh no, the body. We have to hide the body.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A passer-by just happened to find Vegus on the ground, filled with blood. &ldquo;Oh my God.&rdquo; He dragged the half dead man to another place.</p>

<p>Elinora and Arthuer ran back to where Vegus was, but his body was not there. &ldquo;Christ! His body&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t have walked on his own&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Someone took him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was lucky to have survived. When I woke up, I realized that I had lost everything. Everything I had once believed in. It was all a lie! Everything was a lie! I cursed myself over and over for being so na&iuml;ve and stupid!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vegus woke up and moaned. &ldquo;Uhhhh&#8230;&rdquo; He was in an unfamiliar bed. The bed was adjacent to the two sides of the wall. The window was open, allowing light to pass into the room. Vegus winced from excessive brightness. His body was bandaged, and there was some blood on them. His left eye was bandaged, along with his shoulder and left elbow.</p>

<p>A vagrant came in, setting a bowl of water on the floor. &ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re awake, eh?&rdquo; he said in a friendly tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; Vegus asked.</p>

<p>It was a natural question. &ldquo;You are in my house, mate.&rdquo;<br>  &ldquo;Your house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah. You are a very lucky man. You almost didn&rsquo;t make it. I found you lying on the street, barely alive and moaning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long have I been here?&rdquo;<br>  &ldquo;Ohh, you&rsquo;ve been asleep for five days. Sleepin&rsquo; like a child. You were attacked, weren&rsquo;tcha? Say, have you offended somebody?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind that. I thank you for your hospitality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no problem. I couldn&rsquo;t just leave you there to die. Goes &lsquo;gainst my morals, ya know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to be left alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh sure, no problem. If ya need water, here it is. If you need anything, just tell me.&rdquo; The vagrant closed the door.</p>

<p>Vegus sat up in bed, looking at the blanket. It was a moment of despair and sadness. He remembered everything that happened in absolute detail. You could see that he was angry from his face. He was angry at Prince Arthur, Elinora, and especially himself, for being so gullible to fall for their trap. What you couldn&rsquo;t see was the deep hatred and boiling anguish inside of him. He grabbed the blanket and squeezed it tight.</p>

<p>How could this have happened?! I thought I had all I needed. I knew it was too good to be true. The woman I loved, the one whom I trusted unconditionally turned out to be my greatest downfall! Why did they have to do this?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what?&rdquo; asked Faith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At that point, I knew I had to change my life. At that moment, Vegus was dead. He no longer existed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vegus lived at that man&rsquo;s house for some time, not having a place to go to. Jun Yi did not mind. He was a lonely man himself, and did not mind the company. Often, Vegus would want to leave, saying he&rsquo;s alright, but the wounds on his chest would hurt him, and he&rsquo;d moan. Jun Yi would help him back to bed, saying you can&rsquo;t go in this condition.</p>

<p>After much thinking, Vegus made an ultimate decision. &ldquo;I want to go to the Zone of Absolute Fortune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jun Yi cried out in surprise. &ldquo;What did you say? The Zone of Absolute Fortune? Are you nuts?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am serious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No chap, you can&rsquo;t go there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have already made up my mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re injured&#8230;and&#8230;and&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one will stop me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please think it over. It is a dangerous place. It&rsquo;s not in your best interest to go there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the place where my one wish will be granted. I have already lost my life here. That is the only place left for me to go. I always wanted to go there.&rdquo; He got up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait. I am coming with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vegus was surprised and he was speechless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t let you go alone in your condition. It wouldn&rsquo;t be right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vegus thanked him again, and they set off. They wore extra clothes to travel through the blizzard. It was extremely cold and snow blew in their face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The journey was perilous and long, but finally we made it to the Zone of Absolute Fortune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vegus and Jun Yi found themselves standing on a giant symbol on the ground. It was composed of a circle with a boundary, and triangles were inside of the circle. They knew they made it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait for me.&rdquo; Vegus said, and went into the hole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure thing, mate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew I was close, very close. My dreams and desires will be fulfilled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he went deeper into the tunnel, it grew darker. Without a torch in hand, he had to rely on his eyesight, which was already worn out from exhaustion and going through snow. It was quiet, no, not just quiet, but absolutely quiet. There was no sound at all, except for Vegus&rsquo;s footsteps. When he stepped on water, it sounded like someone jumped into a pool.</p>

<p>At last, he traveled to a point where he could not see at all. Scared and worried, he kept on going. He saw a glowing light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh God of the Zone of Absolute Fortune, please hear my call. I summon thee out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rdquo;Who dares disturb my eternal slumber?&rdquo; said the echoing voice. A bright light flashed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Lord Vegus. I have traveled a long way to meet you. Please grant my wishes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it that thou desires?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want power! Nothing but power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much power?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Infinite power!&rdquo; he answered in a loud voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your wish will be granted. However, you must pay a small price. Are you willing to give up your life, your soul, your mind, and your heart?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!!!&rdquo; Vegus answered affirmatively. He was never so sure in his life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your wish will be granted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tentacles grabbed Vegus&rsquo;s legs and arms and tied him up. &ldquo;What&#8230;what are you doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is what you wanted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tentacles surrounded him, and engulfed him. &ldquo;Aaaaaagh!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Vegus woke up, he was still in the darkness. He moaned as he opened his eyes. &ldquo;What&#8230;what happened?&rdquo; He looked in the pond and saw himself, and gasped. Half his face was now robotic, and the other half remained the same. His left eye was just a glowing red ball inside an eye socket, and his eye socket was black and empty. Wires were on his face, and the electric currents could be seen. His left arm was robotic as well, along with his body. &ldquo;What have I become?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Overlord answered him. &ldquo;You hath becometh what you wanted. In this new body, which greatly surpasses your previous frail, weak body, you can achieve what you could not achieve before. You have power beyond your expectations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will have power&#8230;in this body&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In order for you to become strong, I have put a curse on your body...called the Curse of Emotions. But for you, this is a blessing. Your emotions is what led you to your demise, yes? That is why you seeketh my power. Soon, you will feel nothing but negative emotions, like hatred, jealousy, envy, and greed. This will be the driving force of your power. &rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel it&#8230;I can feel the power.&rdquo; He looked at his own hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From now on, you will be known as Vega. Lord Vegus no longer exists.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vega left the cave, coming back to the surface. At this time, he had a mask on. Jun Yi was glad to see him. &ldquo;So, how did it go? Did you get what you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got more than I asked for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great!&rdquo; he said naively. Suddenly, there was a sound of stabbing flesh. Jun Yi had an expression of surprise on his face. Blood dripped on the ground. Vega&rsquo;s tentacles from his arm went through his stomach. He collapsed.</p>

<p>Vega retracted the tentacles into his arm. Jun Yi was a man who did many favors for Vegus, and Vegus once called him a true friend. He even said he will return Jun Yi&rsquo;s favor one day. But Vega does not care about any of that sentimental stuff. He only lives for himself, no one else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you guess what happened afterwards? Yes, that&rsquo;s right, at the time, only revenge was on my mind. I went back home alone. I found the blasted traitors and killed them mercilessly!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;C-can&rsquo;t we talk about this?!&rdquo; Arthur said, squirming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to say to you.&rdquo; Stab!</p>

<p>Elinora screamed with her hands covering her mouth.</p>

<p>Vega pulled his bloody tentacles out of the man&rsquo;s stomach. He approached the woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, please!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was trapped against the wall. &ldquo;Arthur put me to this, I swear! He made me do everything! It wasn&rsquo;t my fault! I really did love you!! I swear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vega came closer. &ldquo;You lying whore.&rdquo; He stabbed her and blood splashed on his mask and cape. The whole room was filled with dead bodies of soldiers. Vega suddenly felt very sick. The smell of the blood and the sight of it made him want to vomit. He could not take the feeling, whatever was causing it. He ran out the door, stumbling like a crippled man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So now, you see?&rdquo; said Vega. That is the price of love. I wish to rid this love off the earth. That way, no one will have to go through what I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson laughed. &ldquo;That was a nice little story. How tragic. It almost brings a tear to my eye.&rdquo; he said sarcastically.</p>

<p>Vega: &ldquo;Those who are foolish enough to believe in love deserve to die. You see how stupid you were, princess of Almerak?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula heard the story as well. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it. Vega actually cared about someone in the past?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith sympathized with his story. &ldquo;It must be a horrible feeling to have someone you love betray you. Although I have not experienced the pain and suffering you have, not even half of it, I know what it is like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You? How would you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, Vega, she might have betrayed you&#8230;but you cannot blame this on the world. Because you have suffered much, it does not give you the right to take out on everybody. To have loved and lost is better than not have loved at all. Yes, you trusted the wrong person, but that doest mean you have to stop loving. If you close your heart in stone, then life will become a miserable journey, a journey full of vengeance and hatred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vega&rsquo;s eyes glowed angrily. &ldquo;Shut up! I don&rsquo;t need your advice&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith continued anyway. &ldquo;If you lost a love, then you should continue searching. For us humans, love is always a gamble. Some win, and some always lose. This is one of the most valuable things, yet one of the most destructive things. But if you find it, you can find happiness. We must never give up on love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is too late for me.&rdquo; Vega said silently. &ldquo;There is no going back. Never.&rdquo; He turned to Tyson. &ldquo;This is your last chance. Give up or I kill her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson crossed his arms. &ldquo;This is the last time I&rsquo;m going to say it. Do what you want. I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith&rsquo;s eyes grew wide open. &ldquo;No Tyson!! You don&rsquo;t mean it!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vega&rsquo;s arm turned into wires, and they merged together, twisting around one another, forming an axe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to kill me! Help me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson continued to stare at the woman with indifference. She was tied up and her cries became background noise.</p>

<p>(Why should I help her? She&rsquo;s just an ungrateful brat like that no good son. Now they mean nothing to me. I can rule the entire earth. What does she mean to me? Nothing, nothing!)</p>

<p>&ldquo;HELP ME!!&rdquo; Faith screamed. &ldquo;Tyson, help!&rdquo;</p>

<p>(She is really going to die? Why should I care? Is it my responsibility? How could I just stand by and watch this? Will I regret it?)</p>

<p>The wires on Faith tightened, and she moaned painfully. Her ankles, wrists, and her neck were being crushed. &ldquo;Ty&#8230;Tyson&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson could not help it. He stared at her helpless face, crying for help. (Is this right? Does the world mean so much to me? After all, she has done much for me in the past&#8230;can I just let her die?)</p>

<p>Images flashed through his mind.</p>

<p>Faith put two fingers into her mouth and whistled, then yelled, &ldquo;Lady!&rdquo; Her white horse galloped from the woods, then stopped in front of her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, goodbye.&rdquo; said Tyson, wanting her to stay.</p>

<p>Faith got on Lady. But her headache came back to strike her. She fell off the horse, and Tyson caught her in his arms. Faith&rsquo;s face turned red and she just stared at him with her beautiful eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be careful.&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&#8230;&rdquo; she said shyly. &ldquo;Thank you. Can you put me down?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He set her back on her feet. She did not look at him and tried not to. Tyson helped her get back on the horse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be careful.&rdquo; Tyson said.</p>

<p>The next image came immediately after. He and Faith were training in the woods, and at that time they had just fallen in love. They were in the bath, she was leaning her back on him, and his arms were around her breasts. They were very close and comfortable. Tyson still remembered that feeling.</p>

<p>Tyson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t the stars beautiful?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sky was dark, and the stars glittered against the darkness. It was like a picture in a dream, only more real.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, they are.&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;But not as beautiful as you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned her head to look at him, and they were face to face. They kissed on the lips briefly. &ldquo;Tyson, can you make me a promise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Promise me&#8230;promise me you&rsquo;ll stay by my side forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was just standing there like a log, while Faith ran around, chasing butterflies. Her angelic smile was enlightening to watch, and the sun seemed to shine around her. That smile was priceless and everlasting in his mind.</p>

<p>He and Faith hugged each other tightly as the sun set. &ldquo;I promise you I will stay with you forever!&rdquo; he said, holding her shoulders. They kissed passionately.</p>

<p>The comet crashed into the island just as the lovers embraced. The island exploded and the entire background turned white. The ground they were standing on started to fall apart, everything was being destroyed. The lovers were sucked into the air and moved apart, they reached for each other&rsquo;s hand, but could not reach far enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tyson!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faith!!!&rdquo; They reached with all their might, but were blown away.</p>

<p>At this point, Tyson grabbed his head in agony and groaned on his knees. &ldquo;Uuugh&#8230;arrrgh!! What&#8230;should I do?&rdquo; Suddenly, he remembered something much more important...</p>

<p>He grabbed her neck with both hands and lifted her up. She gasped for air and her hands grabbed his hands. Her feet were off the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tyson...&rdquo; she said as tears came down her eyes. &ldquo;This is not your fault...I know you w-would never hurt me...there is just one m-more thing I w-want to tell you before I d-die...no matter what happens, I will still love you with all my heart.&rdquo; She closed her eyes.</p>

<p>He suddenly gasped and let go. She dropped down. His eye balls came back. He was shocked that he did such a thing, and regretted it. &ldquo;No, Faith!&rdquo; He searched for his friends. Then he realized he attacked them ruthlessly. &ldquo;No, no!!!&rdquo; He screamed madly and let out a wave of energy. Gold sparks of energy traveled slowly from him and went everywhere. The dots of energy went to the bodies of his loved ones.</p>

<p>Tyson stumbled forward. &ldquo;Faith&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vega: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to cry out in vain anymore. I will end it instantly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Noooooo!&rdquo; Faith screamed. <br>  Vega held the axe firmly, holding it in a position so that one swing would chop her head off instantly. &ldquo;Now DIE!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>*Whoosh! Chop!*</p>

<p>Blood splattered all over the axe.</p>

<p>Vega&rsquo;s eyes widened. &ldquo;Huh? What?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson had already grabbed the axe.</p>

<p>Faith was overjoyed and gasped. &ldquo;Tyson!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Super Sayan smiled. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let you lay a finger on her.&rdquo; He punched and Vega jumped backwards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, you reveal your true feelings at last. I told you love will lead to your downfall! Now both of you die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wires on Faith were loosened, and she fell. &ldquo;Ahhhh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson jumped down and caught her in the air. &ldquo;I got ya.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A blurry figure hit Tyson and he was slammed into a wall. Faith landed on solid ground, with the wires still on her.</p>

<p>Vega: &ldquo;I am in power once again. It&rsquo;s too bad you didn&rsquo;t last long, Super Sayan. Hah hah hah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson, back to normal state, moaned. He patted dust off himself and got ready to fight. Faith cut herself free from the wires and joined her husband.</p>

<p>The killer machine approached them. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re both dead!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The couple got into fighting stance, standing side by side. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do this for old time&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson nodded. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a renewed sense of hope, the couple fought with everything they&rsquo;ve got. Vega charged with speed and strike with his claw. Slash! He missed, Faith jumped up, drew her sword, and slashed while she landed. Vega blocked with his claw, making a metallic sound. Clang! Tyson punched, Vega dodged sideways. He punched again, and missed again. He got kicked in the stomach.</p>

<p>Vega stood watching them, ready to move at any second. Tyson powered up and became Super Sayan. Faith powered up, surrounded by a pink shield and electric sparks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even at your best you are at my mercy!&rdquo; Vega fired a powerful beam and hit them. *Boom*</p>

<p>As the smoke cleared out, they were still in one piece.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vega, by now you should know we can&rsquo;t be beaten so easily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you WILL be beaten!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All three attacked. Faith used her sword, slashing fiercely, and then threw roses, hoping to hit him. Due to the silence of the place, every hit made was heard loudly, even with an echo. They fought on the rooftops, in the air, and on the ground.</p>

<p>Tyson: (There is too much at stake. I will not lose, no matter what!)</p>

<p>Faith: (I won&rsquo;t let this world ruin ours!)</p>

<p>*Bam, bam, bam* They used so much energy they were already tired. The three warriors just stared at each other, breathing hard.</p>

<p>Vega: (Blast it. I am out of energy. They will notice it soon and I will be subject to be beaten. I have get out of here now.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;You notice he&rsquo;s running out of energy?&rdquo; Tyson whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah, but so are we.&rdquo; Faith answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s use up the last of our power. We can end this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They powered up, and Tyson fired the Super Sayan Beam, and Faith fired the Mega Beam. The gold and pink rays of lasers charged at super fast speed, and then combined at the tip. Vega tried to block, but it hit him severely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arrrgh!&rdquo; He fell on his knees. The wires on his chest fell out and electric sparks were seen. He moaned in pain. &ldquo;Well, you are lucky this time. I will kill you later.&rdquo; He jumped onto another rooftop, and kept on jumping away.</p>

<p>Tyson and Faith chased him. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t let him escape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly, a gargoyle dropped down and got in their way. &ldquo;Raaaor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out of the way!&rdquo; Faye yelled, chopping the damn creature into pieces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn, he got away.&rdquo; Tyke announced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can still catch him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They continued running ahead.</p>

<p>Ace and the others regained consciousness. &ldquo;Uhhhh. My back hurts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianne: &ldquo;Quit complainin&rsquo; will ya? You ain&rsquo;t the only one who&rsquo;s hurt.</p>

<p>Neb: &ldquo;Where did they go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derik: &ldquo;Is Tyson back to normal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zell: &ldquo;I think so. I think I saw them fighting Vega together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;Anyways, we have to go where they went. It ain&rsquo;t safe out in the open.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mac: &ldquo;I second that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derik: &ldquo;We have company. A massive army of demons is coming. You see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The heroes looked to the direction he pointed. &ldquo;Oh shit.&rdquo; said Nebula. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s thousands&#8230;.at least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mac: &ldquo;The hell we waitin&rsquo; for? Run for it!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They ran away.</p>

<p>Inside the tallest tower in the shadow world, at the highest floor, was Vega, begging for one last chance. He was injured severely, and on his knees, because he was out of energy, and he was pleading.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, <strong>Overlord</strong>, give me one last chance. I promise you I will kill the earthlings. I will not fail!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Overlord: &ldquo;Very well. This is your final chance, Lord Vega.&rdquo; He zapped him.</p>

<p>Vega screamed and his voice echoed throughout the empty place. Suddenly, the entire shadow world changed. A darkness came over it, a darkness that even the shadow world has never seen. The bright floors and buildings were now black, and within minutes, it spread to throughout the entire shadow world.</p>

<p>Tyson, in normal state, and Faith saw its effects immediately. They did not only see it, but felt it in the form of a gust of wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoa! What was that energy?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such a powerful spirit I have never felt before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a very bad feeling about this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The air force had just arrived below the Silver Crystal, which was inside the tallest tower of the shadow world.</p>

<p>Pilot #1: &ldquo;This is Hawk 1 reporting. I believe we have found the source of energy that&rsquo;s causing this disturbance. Over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Destroy it at once. Over.&rdquo; said the commander at the command center.<br>  &ldquo;Roger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The five jets soared higher, going towards the upside down tower. Suddenly, it zapped one of the jets. Boom! The pilot was lost.</p>

<p>#1: &ldquo;Jesus Christ!&rdquo;</p>

<p>#2: &ldquo;We have to kill that thing now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>#1: &ldquo;Fire at will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The jets shot out all their missiles, but they exploded at the tower&rsquo;s shield.</p>

<p>#3: &ldquo;Sir, they did not work!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tower zapped another jet. Boom!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another one down!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tower zapped again, killing them all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All units lost.&rdquo; said the operator in the command center. The commander was pissed, and he crushed his cup of coffee.</p>

<p>Vega: &ldquo;Such power! I have never felt this powerful before in my life.&rdquo; His eyes glowed a deep red color. &ldquo;Yes! This is what I always wanted! Ultimate power!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson and Faith ran towards the tower, but something blocked their way. A giant bubble shield was formed, with the tower as the center point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a spirit boundary.&rdquo; Faith said. &ldquo;Nothing can get in or out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson banged his fists on it. &ldquo;We have to get in one way or another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly, the bubble opened, just big enough for them to go in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s inviting us to enter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rude not to accept an invitation.&rdquo; Tyson entered. Faith followed. The bubble closed behind them, which they did not notice. There was no turning back, and no looking back for them beyond this step. Their seven years conclusion was now.</p>

<p>The heroes ran towards the tallest tower, and it seemed very far away. Three figures stood in their way.</p>

<p>Neb: &ldquo;Shit! It&rsquo;s the shadow brothers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianne: &ldquo;What bad timing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three stood together, it seemed they were stuck into one body. They laughed sinisterly.</p>

<p>Alpha: &ldquo;It is time for our revenge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beta: &ldquo;You can no longer banish us, since this is the shadow world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Omega: &ldquo;Coming here will be your biggest mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zell grunted. &ldquo;They annoy me. Let&rsquo;s kill them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derik: &ldquo;It will not be easy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The shadows blurred in an instant and the heroes watched out for them. They attacked from the rear and above, and the heroes dodged.</p>

<p>Nebula fired a beam. &ldquo;Yahhhh, take this!&rdquo; Bam!</p>

<p>Alpha dodged it by bending his body. &ldquo;You have to do better than that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace slashed non-stop, but his hits did not hurt the shadow. &ldquo;Die!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three shadow brothers combined their bodies into one. They were now one larger, more powerful body, and when this body spoke, it sounded like all three of them speaking at the same time. &ldquo;Now, you puny humans die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derik: &ldquo;What now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zelfire and Nebula fired their beams and hit the demon&rsquo;s chest. Bam. It touched him for five seconds, but it had no effect. U-Omega laughed loudly. &ldquo;Ha ha ha ha! Is this the best you can do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It turned into a black tornado, spinning at them.</p>

<p> The heroes were shocked and didn&rsquo;t know what to do. How do they fight a tornado? The ground was cracking as U-Omega was spinning towards them. Strong winds blew everywhere.</p>

<p>Ace lost balance and was thrown to the air. Marianna went after him.</p>

<p>Zelfire fired a beam, but it got absorbed into the spinning winds. Derik fired an energy ball, but the same thing happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alright, take this!&rdquo; Nebula fired the Nebula Blast, screaming as he released it. The huge ball went into the tornado, but it was sucked inside. Its brightness could still be seen.</p>

<p>Neb: &ldquo;Damn it! It&rsquo;s still no good. If only it can explode.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;How can we make it explode?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derik: &ldquo;I have an idea.&rdquo; He started chanting a spell, and a spirit ball was released from his body. It went to the tornado, and into the ball of energy. The giant glowing ball exploded, destroying the tornado, and the shadow brothers were blown away.</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;Yeah! Alright! That was awesome!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mac: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too early to celebrate. There&rsquo;s still an army of demons after our tail!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We better go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Almost there!&rdquo; Tyson said, running and panting for breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They kept on running and finally, they were just footsteps from the entrance of the tower.</p>

<p>Vega: &ldquo;They will come in, but will not escape alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The couple went inside, and went up the stairs. A bunch of vines were behind them and chased them. Tyson turned around and screamed, &ldquo;Run!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They ran up the stairs and the vines were catching up. Vines appeared in front of them, and Faith chopped them up, and they continued running. They reached a round, empty room, and in front of them was another plight of stairs. Looking behind, they saw the army of vines going for them. They had no choice but to keep going.</p>

<p> The heroes have made it to the spirit boundary, and unfortunately, they could not go any further.</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;What the hell is this?&rdquo; He banged his fists on the bubble, but it only him get hurt. &ldquo;Ouch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand back.&rdquo; Zelfire said. He used the Energy Blast, but it didn&rsquo;t make a scratch.</p>

<p>Derik: &ldquo;This is a spirit boundary, I&rsquo;m afraid. There is no way we can get through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neb: &ldquo;No way at all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Unless its creator willingly opens it. But I doubt that is going to happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;Crap! We&rsquo;re stuck here. And the demons are here&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>They saw many sets of glowing eyes in the darkness. The demons were laughing and chuckling.</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;I really, really don&rsquo;t like this!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neb: &ldquo;We have no choice but to fight them.</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;Looks like the fate of our world rests in Tyson&rsquo;s and Faith&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mac: &ldquo;And we must do what we can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The heroes prepared themselves physically and mentally for the upcoming battle. It will be tough, and they know it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kill them!&rdquo; the demons shouted. They all charged together.</p>

<p>The heroes charged into the first wave of demons. Blood splattered everywhere. Screams were heard as they were cut into pieces.</p>

<p>The couple finally made it to the last room in the tower. &ldquo;Welcome.&rdquo; Vega said. &ldquo;I have been expecting you.&rdquo; His body was not the same as before. He was now just a head stuck to a body, with wires extending in all directions.</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;We are going to end this right now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;Seven years ago we couldn&rsquo;t kill you, but today will be different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh is that so? I have completely changed. You cannot defeat ultimate power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The heroes powered up. Tyson turned to a Super Sayan. &ldquo;Today we&rsquo;re going to defeat you!&rdquo; they said together. They charged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Infidel!&rdquo; Vega fired a beam, knocking them against the wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oof!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vines grabbed them. Faith slashed them and Tyson pulled them apart. As the heroes struggled, Vega laughed. &ldquo;Do you realize you were never a match for me? Without the Spirit Bomb, you are nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll show you. Faith, let&rsquo;s do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She nodded. They stood side by side, Tyson raised his left arm and Faith raised her right arm, and they gathered energy. Little sparkles of energy went to them and they formed a giant pink ball. Vines went to them but they burned up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; Tyson yelled. They threw the Spirit Bomb forward.</p>

<p>Vega: &ldquo;I will not fall for that again!&rdquo; He countered it with a thick beam. Boom!</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;Damn! The Spirit Bomb failed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;It was supposed to be invincible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not anymore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The vines grabbed them again, and they struggled. Vines came from everywhere. Eventually, their struggling became futile. The vines grabbed their necks, making it hard to breath. &ldquo;Uuugh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your resistance is futile. I will kill you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aaaahh&#8230;&rdquo; Tyson&rsquo;s movements were extremely limited. He moved his arms, swinging them, and his fingers grabbed the thick rope like substances, trying to rip them off. Faith dropped her sword and she could barely move. They were electrified when Vega sent shocks to them.</p>

<p>The other heroes were tired and injured from the battle. Nebula killed off the last demon, and the whole ground was full of dead bodies.</p>

<p>Derik: &ldquo;Please tell me it&rsquo;s over&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>They saw more demons coming, an even bigger army.</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;Oh no&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;Jesus Christ&#8230;we have to fight that?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zelfire: &ldquo;They want us dead, but we will&#8230;we will kill them first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They watched helplessly as the horde of demons ran at them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your energy is mine.&rdquo; Vega sucked their energy from the vines and they screamed in pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen Faith&#8230;uhhh&#8230;we must not give up&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tyson&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>They reached for each other&rsquo;s hands. Their finger tips almost touched, and they reached further, and they held firmly.</p>

<p>Vega: &ldquo;Die!&rdquo; He sent another shock, and they screamed and lost their grip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have fight with what we&rsquo;ve got&#8230;even if it seems like the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&#8230;we&rsquo;re dying&#8230;I feel too weak to do anything&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The whole world depends on us! I will never surrender!&rdquo; Tyson screamed loudly like a madman and struggled with all his might. He powered up even though he was at his maximum. He screamed as loud as he could, at the top of his lungs, and golden energy was released from his body. The whole tower was shaking. His shirt was burning up, and even the black substance on his chest was starting to disintegrate.</p>

<p>He grabbed the sword that Faith dropped.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the other heroes waited for their doom. They were only seconds away. Nebula swallowed hard. Zelfire prayed mentally. They were all scared and worried.</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to teach you not to mess with us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vega: &ldquo;I can do what I want. You cannot overcome my power!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Super Sayan charged angrily. He ran with all his might, looking only forward. Vines popped from the ground and he slashed them. More vines came in front of them. He slashed them all and kept on running forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Vega fired a thick beam, and Tyson ran right into it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;YAAAAAHHHH!&rdquo; he screamed as he jumped into it. He forced himself to go forward, and advanced little by little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson stabbed the sword into Vega&rsquo;s heart. Electric sparks flared and energy was flowing out of his body. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzt!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Noooooooooooooooooooo!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson covered his eyes from the bright lights.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Noooooo!! Nooo!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The vines released Faith, and Tyson ran at her and grabbed her hand. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; They ran down the stairs, and crashed through the window and jumped out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am invincible, I cannot be defeated! I cannot be defeated&#8230;&rdquo; BOOM! Vega exploded and the whole top part of the tower blew up.</p>

<p>As this was happening, the heroes heard the explosion, and the bubble disappeared. The horde of demons suddenly stopped, looking at the falling tower. It crashed, making a loud noise. Wham!</p>

<p>Zelfire: &ldquo;Wha-what happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly, the tower evaporated, turning into small rock chunks. The floor around it started to evaporate. Tyson and Faith ran for their lives as the floor was breaking apart, and if they were a second slower, instant death would happen.</p>

<p>The demons, seeing that the entire place was falling apart, ran the other way.</p>

<p>The heroes cheered happily. Their cheering stopped when the couple ran past them.</p>

<p>Macintosh: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the hurry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;Look behind you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yipes!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All the heroes ran, with the couple leading. The floor was breaking apart faster than they could run, and eventually they&rsquo;d be swallowed up by its energy. They flew up, going towards the earth. The shadow world was destroyed as the floor fell apart, and it spread throughout the entire sky. The people watched dumbfounded as the &lsquo;city in the sky&rsquo; fell into pieces.</p>

<p>Finally, the shadow world was no more. The sky was once again clear blue, and morning came. There was no longer darkness.</p>

<p>The heroes, standing on a rooftop, watched the beautiful blue sky.</p>

<p>Derik: &ldquo;The shadow world is destroyed. I never saw this day coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zelfire: &ldquo;Does this mean the curse is gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Now I can live at ease.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;I am so glad. I could not believe what I had done. Will you ever forgive me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;I never blamed you from the start. Let&rsquo;s just forget what happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They hugged tightly.</p>

<p>Midas, Junior, and Lisa knew that somehow, the warriors had won.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We won! We won!&rdquo; Junior yelled happily. He and Lisa were holding hands and jumping up and down.</p>

<p>Midas: &ldquo;I am very proud of you, young warriors. You have proven time and time again that a good heart always triumphs, and I was never wrong. I never should have doubted you.&rdquo;</p>
