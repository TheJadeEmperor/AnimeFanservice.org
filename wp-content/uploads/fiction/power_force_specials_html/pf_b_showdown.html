<p> <p>Derik had been hiding in the same mountain cave all this time. He could still remember Tyson&rsquo;s punch in his stomach. It was a good one. At first the pain was paralyzing, he could really feel Tyson&rsquo;s anger in it. Now, it was a numb pain. He thought he deserved it, after all he did. As he was meditating, he reconsidered his morals.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tyson Spade&#8230;why does Vega want him dead? Is it because he and princess Faith were the only ones who were able to defeat him?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He learned much about the so called &lsquo;earth warriors&rsquo; from his father. In fact, he learned a little bit too much. Seeing Faith in person really changed perspectives. Why are they willing to risk their lives and not just run away? Is it because they want to protect their home? Their families? Because they&rsquo;re doing what is right? Questions like these clouded his mind and he couldn&rsquo;t decide.</p></p>

<p><p>With everybody gone looking for Faith and her son, King Midas was the only one left in the castle. He was bored and worried about the young ones. &ldquo;My children, where are you?&rdquo; he asked, looking out the balcony.</p></p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s tough being me, he thought. From the very start he did not have a happy family life that a &lsquo;normal&rsquo; person should have. Back in the days when he was a tyrant, both his wives died at an early age, leaving him two children that he neglected. Acelot ran away when he was ten and then only him and his daughter were left. When Acelot finally came back, Faith left home. When the dimensions merged, he thought it&rsquo;d be the perfect chance to catch up on times, now that Faith has a family of her own - a husband and a son. Now they&rsquo;re all gone. How could things have gotten so bad?</p></p>

<p><p>On the grassy fields, Serpent showed up. Midas could sense his presence from where he was. He went outside and faced the enemy. &ldquo;What are you doing here? You are not welcome here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I am grieved to hear that, your majesty.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What do you want here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that obvious? I came here to take your life.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I see now. This was all a setup to lure the others away, leaving me alone here. I will not surrender to you.&rdquo; He took out his sword, which was made of gold and had a jewel in its handle.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;As you wish, your majesty.&rdquo; Serpent took out his sword.</p></p>

<p><p>They attacked and exchanged some moves, and Midas began to think he knew this man from somewhere.</p></p>

<p><p>Serpent: &ldquo;You will pay for what you have done in the past!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who are you?! You are not just a student of Drago, are you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Correct. I am disappointed in you, your majesty. You do not recognize me? It shows your ignorance!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Maybe this will help refresh your memories.&rdquo; He took off his half-mask.</p></p>

<p><p>Midas gasped as if he was looking at death itself. &ldquo;It cannot be! &#8230;You&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I will never forget what you did to me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You thief!&rdquo; yelled the young king Midas. &ldquo;Your crime shall not go unpunished.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please forgive me, your majesty! Spare my life!&rdquo; yelled a young man&rsquo;s voice.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Save your begging for someone else. Take him away.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Soldiers took the man away.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Noooo!&rdquo; he screamed. He kept on screaming and thrashing as the soldiers dragged him away.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ahh, those were the memories.&rdquo; Serpent said in a grimly sarcastic way.</p></p>

<p><p>Midas grunted and sweated.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You ruined my life, King Midas. It&rsquo;s all because I stole some food from your castle. Do you know how hungry I was?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The king was scared, but he spoke with confidence. &ldquo;You deserved your fate! Do not blame me!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, then who is to blame? Myself? I&rsquo;ve lived for revenge, and now today, that desire shall be fulfilled.&rdquo; said Serpent. He attacked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No matter what happened in the past, it is no excuse to join forces with the likes of Drago and Vega!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Midas fought back, but he was no match for Serpent. Their swords collided and Midas was being pushed back after each hit. Slash! Midas was slashed on the right arm. He put his hand on his wound.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I have you now!&rdquo; Serpent exclaimed.</p></p>

<p><p>Midas was in deep trouble.</p></p>

<p><p>Three days have passed since the dreaded day. Tyson was put in the slammer. It was a small, dark, cold, and miserable cell. The warden led Ace and Marianna to Tyson&rsquo;s cell. They saw him and felt bad for him. He looked so miserable and sad. When he saw them, he was excited and went to them and grabbed the bars. &ldquo;You came to get me out, right?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Tyson, we are here to help you. But not the way you intend to.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wanna die! I&rsquo;ll do anything for you! Please help me escape.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ace: &ldquo;The security is too tight here. It is just not possible.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson let out a groan and slid down. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hopeless. I&rsquo;m going to die!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna: &ldquo;We do have hope. If the princess wakes up before you&rsquo;re executed, she might be able to convince her father not to kill you. That is the only chance we have.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Then has she woken up yet?&rdquo; he asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, no. Her condition is stable, but I doubt if she will regain consciousness within two days.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got only two weeks left before my execution.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ace: &ldquo;I know you did your best, Tyson. We are with you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson Spade&rsquo;s parents were given a message about his execution. Their reaction, of course, was shock and outrage. But they were more scared than angry. &ldquo;How can this be?!?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Our son is going to be killed?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;There has to be some kind of mistake!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They sat there and grieved, then decided that they should visit the Imperial Palace and find out exactly what is going on.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Listen Marianne.&rdquo; Ace said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;If worse comes to worse, and the princess does not wake up within one week, then we will be left with no other choice than that.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I see. You think we are doing the right thing?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I know Tyson is a good man. Not helping him would be a crime against my morals. We must prepare, just in case.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Soldier: &ldquo;Your majesty. There is two people who want to see you urgently.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Midas touched his beard. &ldquo;Who could it be? I am not expecting anyone.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Shall I send them in?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please&#8230;your majesty...&rdquo; said Margrit.</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;Our son is very important to us. Please let him go!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do anything! Anything you want!&rdquo; Margrit said with tears. <br>  As the men began to take them away, Midas waved his arm, his men stopped.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Anything?&rdquo; he asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes. Anything.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Midas rubbed his chin, looking at Margrit. Her eyes told the truth. &ldquo;Very well then.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit smiled.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I have one thing to ask of you. Just you, Margarita Spade.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;What about me, your majesty?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You are no longer needed here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The men took him away. Margrit was curious on what Midas was planning.</p></p>

<p><p>Midas got up. &ldquo;Alright, Margarita, you come with me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Okay...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The soldiers pushed Terry out of the castle and closed the door. He ran to the door, but two guarded soldiers with spears blocked his way. &ldquo;At least tell me what&rsquo;s going on inside!&rdquo; he said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That is not our business, neither is yours.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;I just hope Margrit can save our son. Margrit, good luck.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I am ready.&rdquo; said Margrit&rsquo;s voice. The door knob turned and opened. Margrit came through the door halfway, then stopped. She was wearing nothing but a red towel. She entered shyly and reluctantly, and then closed the door. She was staring at the floor the whole time, with one hand between her breasts, holding on to her towel.</p></p>

<p><p>Midas, sitting on the bed. He stared at her body from head to toe. She was extremely beautiful, he thought, and even more beautiful when not wearing any clothes.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Come here.&rdquo; he commanded, as he stood up.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit obeyed and walked towards him. There was fear in her eyes. The deal was that Margrit would give herself to him in exchange for her son&rsquo;s release. It was the hardest decision she ever had to make in her life. But she had to do it for her son. Her only son.</p></p>

<p><p>Midas grabbed her shoulders and she gasped. He kissed her lips and she did not resist. He enjoyed every second of it. He kissed her lips many times, then grabbed her breasts. He began to untie her towel, then she grabbed his fingers. &ldquo;No...wait...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, no...I can&rsquo;t...&rdquo; She sat on the bed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What is the matter? I thought we had an agreement?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She was crying. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t...&rdquo; She hid her face in her hands. &ldquo;I...I can&rsquo;t do this...I feel like I am cheating on my husband.&rdquo; she whimpered, burying her face in her hands.</p></p>

<p><p>Midas sat next to her. He touched her hands and caressed them. &ldquo;You are doing this for your son, remember?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, but...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You have to do this to save your son. You are doing the right thing.&rdquo; He put his hand on her thigh.</p></p>

<p><p>She moved away. &ldquo;No...I can&rsquo;t...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My dear, you cannot back away now. You do not have a choice.&rdquo; Midas grabbed her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please, no, your majesty!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Midas kissed her lips as his hand grabbed her thigh and went into her towel. Tears dripped from her eyes. She pushed him off and stood up.</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;No, your majesty!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You are mine!&rdquo; He grabbed her and kissed her lips. She struggled but it was no use, his arms were around her body and her arms were trapped. He slammed her against the cabinet and she screamed. Midas grabbed her back, then squeezed her shoulders. Margrit screamed. He sniffed her hair and put his face into her hair. It smelled so good he let out a sigh of pleasure. He kissed her neck, then grabbed her head and slammed it against the cabinet. Thud, thud! Margrit groaned in pain after each hit.</p></p>

<p><p>Thud. &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; Thud. &ldquo;Ugh Stop it, please!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He turned her around, and now they were face to face. &ldquo;No, your majesty. Please don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she pleaded with tears.</p></p>

<p><p>He kissed her lips, while his right hand went for her thigh, caressing it, and going up into her towel. She pushed him away, and ran for it. Midas grabbed her and slapped her. Smack. She fell on the floor. Thud.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Uhhhh...&rdquo; She got up, breathing hard. &ldquo;No, no---&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Midas grabbed her wrist, pulling her into him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please, no!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Midas slapped her face. Smack! He grabbed her and kissed her lips. His hand touched her thigh. She pushed him away.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...please...no!&rdquo; she cried as he approached.</p></p>

<p><p>He pulled her towel off and she was naked. She just stood there, helpless as he grabbed her and kissed her. Her eyes were shut and tears dripped down her face as he kissed her lips. He kissed her shoulders, and his hand touched her back all over. Her skin was so soft and smooth to touch. He pushed her on the bed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh.&rdquo; Her head landed on the pillow. Midas got on top of her, and kissed her lips, and held her hands tightly to prevent any resistance.</p></p>

<p><p>Then he kissed her shoulders.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...please stop!!&rdquo; she screamed as he had his way with her.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit lay on the bed motionless, her face in the pillow. Midas was on top of her, touching her back. Margrit moaned painfully. Her hands grabbed the pillow. Midas grabbed her hands and squeezed her fingers as he sniffed her hair. She smelled good. His face was in her hair, and his lips touched it. He kissed her neck, and her shoulders. His lips moved down her back, kissing it all over.</p></p>

<p><p>He took her hand and kissed it. He kissed her arm all over and kissed her shoulder. Margrit moaned in pain and tears dripped on the pillow.</p></p>

<p><p>Terry sat on the steps, bored and impatient. &ldquo;What could be taking so long? She&rsquo;s been in there for hours. I wish I could help...&rdquo; He remained there, clueless, elbows on his laps, and his chin resting on his hands.</p></p>

<p><p>Midas kissed Margrit&rsquo;s lips as her fingers grabbed the bed sheet tightly. Tears dripped from her eyes. Midas kissed her neck, then her shoulders. Her legs kicked helplessly, and Midas used his legs to trap hers, and her movements were reduced. He kissed her breasts and Margrit screamed in pain. She moaned as he tortured her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please stop...&rdquo; Margrit pleaded with tears. &ldquo;Please...your majesty...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Midas kissed her lips. He slapped her face and she screamed louder than she&rsquo;s ever screamed in her life. The pain and agony she felt was the most painful she had ever felt. His hand grabbed her wrists, squeezing them tightly. Her bones broke as he squeezed her wrists. Tears of pain dripped from her eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...please...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Midas kissed her lips and his hands squeezed her wrists tighter, her wrists hurt even more. She was completely helpless under him. Midas grabbed her leg and lifted it on his shoulder. He kissed her ankle and touched her leg all over &ndash; her thigh, her lower thigh, behind the leg, and her knee. His hand touched her skin and moved down her leg.</p></p>

<p><p>Nothing felt better than the skin of a young, beautiful woman. He wasn&rsquo;t this excited and aroused in years, and being the king, he had a lot of pressure to deal with. And he was going to let it all out on Margrit.</p></p>

<p><p>He kissed her ankle many times, then kissed her knee, then kissed her thigh. It was pure excitement and pleasure for the king. His hand went lower, went to her vagina and she screamed. Her screamed echoed into the hallway, but nobody heard her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...please...no...&rdquo; she cried with her eyes half open.</p></p>

<p><p>Midas slapped her face. He felt greater than never before. He no longer felt old, but instead young and alive again. His pleasure grew and grew and veins popped on his forehead. He laughed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No!! No!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit was screaming and groaning loudly, but no one heard her in the hallway. Midas kissed her shoulders, and her neck, ravaging her non-step. Tears dripped on the bed. His hands still holding her wrists tightly, squeezing her already broken bones. Her feet kicked helplessly.</p></p>

<p><p>Midas grabbed her leg, lifted it up. One hand was on her lower thigh, and the other holding her upper thigh. With one fast motion, he made a twist. Crack. He broke her leg.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;AHHHHHH!!!&rdquo; screamed Margrit with fresh tears. Her hands grabbed the bedsheet tighter than ever.</p></p>

<p><p>He grabbed the other leg and broke it.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;AHHHHHHHH!!!&rdquo; The sound of broken bones could be heard.</p></p>

<p><p>He kissed her breasts, and squeezed her already broken wrists. Her fingers were losing their grip on the bed sheet. Midas kissed her lips. It was so painful that Margrit wished she was dead. Anything was better than this.</p></p>

<p><p>Midas stroked her and she screamed with whatever strength she had left. He stroked her countless times, occasionally slapping her for no reason.</p></p>

<p><p>The pain became so unbearable she screamed like she never screamed before. Her cries of agony were music to his ears. Eventually, she couldn&rsquo;t scream any more. She had no energy left...she couldn&rsquo;t even fall unconscious. It was a worse fate than death.</p></p>

<p><p>Midas kissed her lips, and made it the longest kiss ever. Margrit was already near dead, and she could not take anymore of this. The pain was unbearable. Never in her life had she faced this kind of pain and torture, and it was the most painful experience that anyone could ever go through.</p></p>

<p><p>Her fingers grabbed the bed sheet as tight as they could, as his hands were squeezing her wrists. Her feet kicked helplessly. Tears dripped endlessly from her eyes. Her eyes were already closed, and couldn&rsquo;t open, and the tears kept dripping. She could not even breathe. His lips were completely locked into hers, and he did not move.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit&rsquo;s fingers were weakening, losing their grip on the bed sheet. Little by little, her fingers let go. Her fingers lost grip and stopped moving. Her legs stopped kicking. One last drop of tear came from the corner of her eye, landing on the bed.</p></p>

<p><p>Midas removed his lips from hers. He had just realized what he had done, but he just smiled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame. You will never see your son again.&rdquo; Tears were still on her face.</p></p>

<p><p>Terry felt this sudden pain in his heart. He couldn&rsquo;t explain it to himself - it was just a strange feeling. He turned around to look at the guards and the big wooden doors. Something urged him to get inside - even if there are obstacles.</p></p>

<p><p>Back in the real world... Midas breathed hard. Serpent was about to make his move. He had to be ready to counter the right way, or it could mean instant death&#8230;</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="PF_16_A">16: End of Round 3: The Poisoned Man's Paradox </span></p></center>

<p> <p>Blaire and Maxima had been defeated, but will Serpent be defeated just like them? Can Acelot make it back in time to save his father?</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was lying in bed, tucked under a warm blanket, with an ice pack on her forehead. She moaned unconsciously. &ldquo;Tyson...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Midas sat on the king&rsquo;s chair in the outside court, the place of the execution. Royal soldiers were around him. On the other side of the court was the prisoner, with his head and hands locked in a piece of wood. Two soldiers were on the platform.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson kneeled there, being silent and miserable. He really thought he was going to die. (I don&rsquo;t want to die! I don&rsquo;t want to die!) he kept on thinking.</p></p>

<p><p>Terry Spade had been sitting outside for hours now, and he was getting extremely impatient. What was going on in there? he thought. He just had to find out, no matter what, even if it meant taking risks. He had a bad feeling about this.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Just tell me what is happening in there!&rdquo; he yelled to the soldiers.</p></p>

<p><p>They did not answer. He became more frustrated. Suddenly, he realized something - the thought hit him like a thunderbolt. What could the king possibly get from Margrit and not him. Of course, he thought. He just wants her body. He wasn&rsquo;t about to let the dirty old king touch his wife. He charged straight for the door. The soldiers blocked his way with their spears. &ldquo;You have no permission to enter!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Out of my way!&rdquo; He attacked them and they fell down the stairs. He broke the door and went in.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Interesting.&rdquo; said Drago, examining the crystal ball. Everything that occurred in their dream world was seen by him. &ldquo;Love causes so many things to happen. It also leads to other emotions as well, such as hatred, anger, greed, and sadness.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lisa was still screaming inside the bubble and kicking and banging her fists. &ldquo;Let me out! Let me out! I swear you will regret it!&rdquo; she kept on saying. It was really getting on Drago&rsquo;s nerves.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Shut up, girl.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ace was running at top speed because he sensed his father&rsquo;s ki was fading. (Father! I&rsquo;m coming!)</p></p>

<p><p>Midas was struggling to survive. He was on the ground, gasping for breath. Serpent pointed the sword at him. &ldquo;Your time is up, old man.&rdquo; He attacked.</p></p>

<p><p>Midas blocked with his sword, and they were in a struggle. &ldquo;This is your end. The downfall of the Midas family begins today.&rdquo; Serpent said as he pushed the blade against Midas&rsquo;s blade.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You were a thief, and now you are just a murderer!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&#8230;are wrong!&rdquo; Serpent pushed extra hard, and they both stepped back from the force. *Slash*</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Ace showed up. &ldquo;Stop! Leave him.&rdquo; he yelled. He ran, taking out his sword, and slashed. Serpent jumped back in defense. &ldquo;Are you alright, father?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Prince Acelot, I presume?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. You are Serpent, the third student of Drago, right?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Correct.&rdquo; Serpent replied, concluding their introductions.</p></p>

<p><p>Midas grabbed Ace by his collar. &ldquo;He is dangerous, my son. You must be careful.&rdquo; He fainted.</p></p>

<p><p>Ace gently put the king&rsquo;s head on the ground. &ldquo;You will pay for hurting my father.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Serpent smiled in amusement. &ldquo;Oh really?&quot;</p></p>

<p><p>They began to attack. Their blades collided with each other&rsquo;s, making loud metal noises. *Cling! Clang!* They slashed and their blades slammed into each other, and they struggled and grunted. Now it was a test of strength. They pushed with a lot of energy, and it looked like they weren&rsquo;t moving, but they were using all the strength they had. They jumped away and prepared mentally for the next attack. For four seconds, neither of them moved. Suddenly, Ace charged and slashed, and Serpent blocked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I swear I will kill you by my sword.&rdquo; He pointed at his enemy. &ldquo;You hear me, Serpent?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What makes you so sure you can win?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ace grunted. &ldquo;I know I will. I&rsquo;ll make you lose.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Then try your best.&rdquo; Serpent pointed his sword and got ready.</p></p>

<p><p> The prince charged and screamed, ready to attack aggressively. Serpent jumped into the air, dodging his attack. Ace stopped and watched.</p></p>

<p><p>Serpent: &ldquo;Poison Needle Attack!&rdquo; He shot a dozen needles from his sleeve and Ace blocked with his sword. Then he shot another army of needles, each one sharp and deadly. Ace gasped and ran away, and the needles hit the ground. &ldquo;There is no escape, Prince Acelot!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Try and hit me!&rdquo; he yelled back, running.</p></p>

<p><p>Serpent flew after him. He landed in front of him. Ace was very worried now. &ldquo;Die.&rdquo; He shot the needles.</p></p>

<p><p>Ace blocked with his sword, knocking some of them away, and the others went past him. One needle hit his thigh and another hit his shoulder. &ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; He was in big trouble now, and he had to admit it to himself. He pulled the needles out like they were nothing.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You have been hit by my poison needles.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Poison? You bastard&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now it is only a matter of time. You should begin to feel the effects immediately.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ace: (He&rsquo;s right! I don&rsquo;t feel so good!) He was getting dizzy and his vision became blurry. Serpent became two and three people. He focused his eyes, and the Serpents became one again. (This is one of most deadly poisons&#8230;uhhh&#8230;It&rsquo;s like being stung by a real serpent&#8230;) His body felt weaker, but his grip tightened on the Royal Sword.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;There can only be one antidote, which is not hard to get. But I will not let you live before you can find a cure.&rdquo; He attacked.</p></p>

<p><p>Ace got ready for the worst.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was lying in bed, tucked under a warm blanket, with an ice pack on her forehead. She moaned unconsciously. &ldquo;Tyson...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darian came in to visit her. &ldquo;My darling, you need not worry anymore. Tyson will be executed soon. Then you can become mine.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry fought his way through the guards and reached the bedroom hall of the castle. He searched each room and finally found Margrit. He was completely shocked as he went in. He walked towards her slowly, in disbelief. &ldquo;Margrit...&rdquo; He fell on his knees and cried. &ldquo;Margrit! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!&rdquo; he screamed at the top of his lungs.</p></p>

<p><p>Midas: &ldquo;The execution shall proceed in five minutes.&rdquo; All the soldiers and guards watching waited in suspense. Tyson awaited his doom.</p></p>

<p><p>Ace and Serpent charged and attacked. *Cling! Clang!* Their blades hit and sparks came out. Serpent shot three needles at him, and Ace dodged. Then he jumped up, but Serpent jumped and punched him down. Wham! Ace fell on the ground and dropped his sword.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Either you get stabbed by me, or if you are lucky enough to survive, you will die by the poison. Either way, you lose!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; With one hand on his chest and the other on his sword he got up. He forced himself and got into fighting position, breathing hard.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmmph. Why do you bother?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ace&rsquo;s vision was getting blurry again. He charged nonetheless. Serpent blocked his sword, then kicked Ace in the stomach &ndash; Wham! Then he punched Ace&rsquo;s face. Pow! He was hit so hard his feet were off the ground and he fell on his back.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Die!&rdquo; He shot another bunch of needles.</p></p>

<p><p>Ace was hit and he screamed. Serpent shot another group of needles. Just then, Ace thought: (Wait a minute, I&rsquo;m already infected! Why should I avoid them?) He charged forward, taking the needles, something Serpent did not expect. He punched Serpent&rsquo;s face &ndash; *Pow!* He dropped the sword! Ace kept on punching and Serpent blocked with his arms. *Pow pow bam* Serpent felt a lot of pain. He waited for an opening, and then kicked Ace in the stomach. *Wham!*</p></p>

<p><p>Serpent: &ldquo;You are pretty strong. But it ends now!&rdquo; He picked up his sword.</p></p>

<p><p>Ace quickly got up and ran and picked up his sword, then got ready.</p></p>

<p><p>They charged into each other and slashed! They went past each other and remained still. Serpent remained confident, that is until...a piece of his hair fell to the ground slowly, then his mask cracked and fell. Blood dripped on the ground. He flashed back to just a moment ago when Ace punched him continuously. (That attack made my arms injured, so that I will miss.) Because Ace had injured his arms, his accuracy with the sword decreased and that&rsquo;s why his attack missed.</p></p>

<p><p>Ace turned around to face his enemy. &ldquo;Do you know what your mistake was?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Serpent&rsquo;s eyes opened wide.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You only have one special move, which is your poison needles. But as soon as you poisoned me, I have no reason to dodge those needles anymore.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So in other words...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Once someone is poisoned those needles don&rsquo;t work any more. You never should have used them a second time...&rdquo; Ace charged up ki into his sword and slashed Serpent, finishing him off for good.</p></p>

<p><p>Ace went to his father and helped him up.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My son!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I am alright, father. I&#8230;I just wanted you to be proud of me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Of course I am proud of you. You are my one and only son.&rdquo; Midas sat up.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Father - Uuugh!&rdquo; Ace felt the pain again. He grabbed his chest.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, you have been poisoned.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, that scumbag got me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Come on, my son, let us get the cure.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Okay, father.&rdquo; They helped each other stand up, and started walking back to the castle.</p></p>

<p><p>Hop, hop, hop. Jumping from rock to rock, Zelfire stopped when he was close enough to the volcano. This was where Graveller was waiting for him. Lightning struck as they stared at each other.</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="PF_17_A">17: Inter-dimensional Showdown Round 4: Hard Headed. </span></p></center>


<p> <p>Only one of the students of Drago remained. It was all up to Zelfire to defeat him. He did not know that the others had won, but he did know that he must win.</p></p>

<p><p>As they stared at each other, lightning struck. The sky was pitch black. Fear, hatred, anger, confidence, and hope were all felt by Zelfire at that moment.</p></p>

<p><p>Graveller roared and pounded his chest. &ldquo;Stupid human come to die. Graveller will crush.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Listen, you ugly brute, I came here to kill you. So prepare yourself!&rdquo; He ran up.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No human call me ugly!&rdquo; Graveller ran down and punched, and they hit on the fists. *Bam!* A shockwave was produced. They continued hitting, trying to finish off the opponent as soon as possible. They jumped into the air. Zelfire powered up and shot the Energy Blast. Graveller blocked it. Zelfire charged and gave him a good combo &ndash; a kick in the neck, a punch in the face, then a knee jam in the face. Wham! *Bam! Pow!* Graveller did not show any signs of pain. He grumbled and punched Zell into the rocks. *Crash!*</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s much tougher than last time.&rdquo; Zell commented as he got up. &ldquo;This is not going to be easy.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They continued fighting and Zelfire was knocked into the volcano. *Whoosh!* His hand grabbed on to a rock sticking out of the wall to prevent falling into the lava. A few rock chucks fell into the boiling lava and it burned instantly. Zelfire definitely did not want to become barbecue. Suddenly, Graveller appeared and fired a beam that hit the wall, knocking Zelfire down.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ahhhhhh!&rdquo; Luckily, he landed on a floating boulder. The whole lava pool was full of floating boulders scattered randomly.</p></p>

<p><p>Graveller landed on another boulder and the warriors did the stare again. Zelfire powered up and leapt to the air. He charged and punched, Graveller evaded. The rock monster soared up to Zelfire&rsquo;s height and kicked, and Zelfire dodged. They soared higher and kicked each other dozens of times. They hit on the knees and Zell&rsquo;s bones were weakening. <br>  Graveller punched Zell in the chest, and it was a hard one. It felt like being hit by a pound of steel directed at one spot. He fell on the boulders. He got up and breathed hard, as Graveller landed.</p></p>

<p><p>(This guy is made of solid granite! How am I supposed to beat a hard-headed freak like him? There&rsquo;s got to be a way, and I have to find it.) He got ready to fight, then realized he was sweating. (My energy can&rsquo;t protect me from this heat for long. He doesn&rsquo;t seem to be affected. I have to find a chance to escape.)</p></p>

<p><p>Faith woke up with a huge headache. She touched her forehead, feeling the wound. &ldquo;Uhhh...where am I? Is this my room?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darian entered. &ldquo;Ahh, princess, you are awake.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Darian, how long have I been here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Why, you were unconscious for almost two weeks.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Two weeks?&rdquo; she said in shock. &ldquo;Where is Tyson Spade?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No need to worry about that man. He is about to be executed.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;WHAT?&rdquo; She sprang out of bed. &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Princess, he is no longer of importance-&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Fine then, do not tell me!&rdquo; She ran out.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he yelled.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith knew where the official executions took place. That was the place for really bad criminals.</p></p>

<p><p>Midas held the &ldquo;death sign&rdquo; in his hand. Once the king throws the &ldquo;death sign&rdquo; on the ground, the executioner will cut the person&rsquo;s head off. The executioner in a black mask was almost ready. He picked up an axe and held it up.</p></p>

<p><p>This is it, the end, Tyson told himself mentally. All of a sudden he felt as if he did not belong in this place, in this world. Maybe he was misplaced here, yeah, that&rsquo;s it. It&rsquo;s all a big mistake.</p></p>

<p><p>Midas threw the death sign on the ground. The axe man began to swing the axe. &ldquo;Hold it!&rdquo; yelled Princess Faith.</p></p>

<p><p>Everybody stopped and became silent. She approached the axe man in a threatening stance. He backed away.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson looked at her. &ldquo;Princess?&rdquo; he said, dumbfounded.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Put it down now!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Midas got up. &ldquo;My daughter, what are you doing here?&rdquo; You should be resting!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Father, why are you doing this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It is for your own good, daughter. Now stay out of this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, I cannot. Tyson <strong>did</strong>risk his life to save me, many times. Even before he was a bodyguard he saved me. How should he end up like this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He failed his responsibility.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No. He has not failed me! Father, I love him!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson and Midas were shocked. The soldiers did not know how to react.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;Princess? You don&rsquo;t have to do this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please do not kill him, father.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Midas: &ldquo;Noooooo! Do you know what you are saying?&rdquo;<br>  &ldquo;I know exactly what I am saying.&rdquo; She set Tyson free.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Guards, capture that man and remove my daughter from this place, but not hurt her.&rdquo; Guards approached.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith grabbed a sword from one of them and slashed threateningly. &ldquo;Stay back!&rdquo; she said. She and Tyson were surrounded. They forced their way at them and grabbed Tyson. &ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; The guards grabbed him and one of them got ready to stab him. An arrow hit his sword. *Clang!*</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Ace and Marianna dropped in.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ace: &ldquo;Howdy, princess? Nice to see you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Thank you so much, my good friends.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna: &ldquo;Anytime, princess.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Midas: &ldquo;Traitors! Guards, get them!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ace threw Tyson a sword and he caught it. They fought the soldiers and the scene turned into chaos. The king watched helplessly.</p></p>

<p><p>Darian came and attacked Tyson. They slashed with their swords. &ldquo;Stop this! What are you doing?! I don&rsquo;t want to fight you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tyson, you are already a dead man, so die!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Terry showed up.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Father?&rdquo; said Tyson.</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;King Midas, you bastard!&rdquo; He was extremely angry. No words could have described the hatred he felt. &ldquo;How dare you...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Midas: &ldquo;You fool, this is private property.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Father, what happened?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What happened? Let me tell you.&rdquo; said Terry, and his anger showed clearly in his voice. &ldquo;This man-&rdquo; He pointed at Midas. &ldquo;He killed your mother!&rdquo; Tyson was dumbfounded. &ldquo;He killed her! He killed her!&rdquo; Then he sobbed and shed tears. &ldquo;...She can never come back now, never...she is gone for good. She can never return to this world!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith: &ldquo;Father, that is not true! Please tell me!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Midas: &ldquo;Faith, you need not concern yourself with this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry charged and attacked. He punched and Midas blocked. &ldquo;How dare you kill my wife! I will never forgive you, not until you die!&rdquo; He punched Midas viciously. *Pow pow pow!*</p></p>

<p><p>Darian: &ldquo;Here your majesty!&rdquo; He threw Midas a sword.</p></p>

<p><p>Midas swung it at Terry, and he dodged. They continued to fight as Tyson fought the soldiers. Darian grabbed Terry as Midas charged with the sword. Terry pushed Darian away, and he got stabbed. *Stab!* Terry, feeling the pain, still grabbed Midas&rsquo;s neck, but could not hold it. Midas kicked him and he fell.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;Father!!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darian went to the king. &ldquo;We better leave this mess, your majesty.&rdquo; They left.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson went to his dying father. &ldquo;Father? Speak to me!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith watched them in shock. Marianna and Ace finished off the last of the soldiers, and watched the scene.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Father...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry coughed blood, and gathered whatever strength he had left to say his last words. &ldquo;You have t-to avenge your m-mother, my son.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; he said, shedding tears.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My son...you have t-to take r-evenge...&rdquo; His eyes closed and his head turned.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson knew he was dead. &ldquo;Father...why...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The others were silent. They did not know what was the right thing to say to some one whose father had just died. Faith watched in horror, she felt sad for Tyson, and was still in disbelief that her father had done this.</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire attacked with a fierce combo of punches and kicks, but they didn&rsquo;t hurt Graveller a bit. They jumped on the rocks and hit each other. Graveller blasted the lava, and the lava burst up and a big wave went towards Zell. <br>  &ldquo;Yipes!&rdquo; Zelfire dodged it. The lava hit the rocks and melted them. They jumped up and hit each other. Zelfire used the Energy Blast and blasted Graveller into the lava.</p></p>

<p><p>He screamed and roared as he sunk into the burning lava.</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire was glad to get out of there. He thought Graveller was a goner for sure. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way he could survive, even if he&rsquo;s solid rock.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>However, his joy ended when the volcano began to erupt. It began to shake, and fire balls flew out from the volcano. Then it exploded and lava blasted out. Just then, Graveller flew out, boiling red and angrier than ever.</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire: &ldquo;No way!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Graveller roared and his voice echoed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What does it take to kill this guy?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Graveller charged at him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Die!&rdquo; Zelfire blasted his chest open, and there was a hole on him.</p></p>

<p><p>The monster did not even budge. It breathed in and rock fragments on the ground went to his chest and filled in the empty spots. He was back to normal condition within seconds.</p></p>

<p><p>Zell: &ldquo;Why you!&rdquo; He jumped and punched him right in the nose, but it had no effect.</p></p>

<p><p>Graveller grabbed his arm and punched his stomach. Wham! &ldquo;Human must die!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&#8230;will not lose.&rdquo; said the injured warrior. <br>  <br> </p></p>


<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="PF_18_A">18: End of Round 4: Shattered Hearts, Minds and Bodies </span></p></center>


<p> <p>Tyson kneeled in front of his parents&rsquo; graves. The stones were next to each other. He put some flowers on both. It was very sad indeed, and Ace and Marianna felt sorry for Tyson.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mother, father, rest in peace. I promise you I will not let you die for nothing. All I ever wanted was to make you proud!&rdquo; He shed tears.</p></p>

<p><p>Ace put his hand on Tyson&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;We can have time to grieve later. They would not want to see you like this, right?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;Are you coming with me?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna: &ldquo;We have reason to believe that the king is in alliance with Koga. That means our alliance is no longer valid. Besides, we saved you, and thus disregarded his wishes.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ace: &ldquo;We had always been loyal to him, but we cannot be any longer. We shall attack tomorrow.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith came, looking as sad as Tyson. He stood up and looked surprised. &ldquo;Princess?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tyson, promise me you will not kill my father!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He looked on the ground. &ldquo;Sorry. I can&rsquo;t do that. My parents must be avenged!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But...you just cannot!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How would you like it if you were me?!&rdquo; he shouted. She gasped. &ldquo;I thank you for everything you&rsquo;ve given me. I no longer have an obligation with you, Princess Faith. Farewell.&rdquo; He left. Ace and Marianna followed him.</p></p>

<p><p>*Wham!* Zelfire fell on the ground. Graveller advanced towards him and grabbed him by the shirt. &ldquo;Human die!&rdquo; he grumbled.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Do your worst.&rdquo; Zell said weakly, smiling.</p></p>

<p><p>Graveller lifted him higher, then punched his stomach and threw him away. *Wham!*</p></p>

<p><p>He lay on the ground, helplessly moaning. He moved his hands, and got on his feet slowly, breathing hard. &ldquo;Why you&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How am I supposed to beat him now?&rdquo; he said hopelessly. &ldquo;What? What are you guys doing here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula, Macintosh, Acelot, and Marianna arrived, each of them were physically injured and tired.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;We came to help, of course.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna: &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t expect to beat this monster by yourself.</p></p>

<p><p>Ace: &ldquo;It is time for some real teamwork, eh guys?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Macintosh: &ldquo;I second that.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire: &ldquo;Thank you, guys.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The heroes surrounded Graveller, preparing to battle. They seemed confident and re-energized.</p></p>

<p><p> Nebula: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, we&rsquo;re gonna send you to hell!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire was on his knees, unable to get strength. The heroes powered up. Graveller powered up aggressively and his energy knocked the others. They screamed in surprise and covered their eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;What a massive energy!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ace: &ldquo;Time to duel, rock head!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>All the heroes attacked together. Ace punched its head, Nebula punched its chest, Marianna kicked its neck, and Macintosh hit its back, but he felt nothing. He roared and pushed all of them away.</p></p>

<p><p>Meanwhile, Junior wandered alone in the forest, hoping to find somebody that can help him.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna: &ldquo;Now remember, Junior, I will be back very soon. Stay here and don&rsquo;t move. Okay?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He waited and waited, but his friend never came back, so he grew impatient and left to find her. But he was just a kid and he got lost again. He found an opening and a building ahead. He quickly ran there, but some one stood in his way.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who-who&rsquo;re you?&rdquo; he asked timidly.<br>  &ldquo;I am Vega, overlord of this world. Ah, you are the son of Princess Faith, are you not? What kind fate it is that we run into each other.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vega? Junior thought. Uh oh, he&rsquo;s the big bad guy that Marianna told him about. He realized he was in great danger.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula drew his sword and slashed Graveller&rsquo;s chest, but it barely made a scratch. &ldquo;Yahh!&rdquo; he yelled as he attacked. He chopped off one of his arms.</p></p>

<p><p>Graveller stood still, and his severed arm went back to its place by itself.</p></p>

<p><p>Ace: &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zell: &ldquo;Be careful guys, he can regenerate himself endlessly!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna: &ldquo;What? How are we supposed to defeat a foe like that?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;Simple, We blow him into dust so he can&rsquo;t regenerate!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Easier said than done.&rdquo; Marianna replied.</p></p>

<p><p>Graveller powered up and screamed and the ground shook and shattered. The four heroes got together and remained defensive. Graveller&rsquo;s body came off piece by piece, and the rock fragments flew at the heroes, who were shocked to see this technique. They got hit by rocks and screamed painfully. The rocks went past them, then came together and formed Graveller.</p></p>

<p><p>Ace: &ldquo;He can do that too?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Graveller&rsquo;s body came apart again, and the heroes knew he was gonna use that attack again. They jumped into the air since there&rsquo;s more room to dodge. The rocks followed them up and hit them. Graveller appeared behind Ace and knocked him down. *Wham!*</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;Why you!&rdquo; He charged and released a fury of punches on his chest. Graveller punched his stomach, and Nebula felt paralyzed by the pain. Graveller threw him at Marianna and they crashed into a boulder.</p></p>

<p><p>Macintosh was the only one left, and he wanted to make it count. He fired the Electro-shockwave, but Graveller dodged. He kept on firing and his enemy kept on dodging. Graveller&rsquo;s arms separated from his body, and one of them flew at Mac&rsquo;s face. He ducked and thought he was lucky. The second hand grabbed his foot and dragged him down. &ldquo;Ahhh!&rdquo; The first arm went back to Graveller&rsquo;s body, and he punched Mac, knocking him into the ground.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula and Marianna were on top of each other, recovering from the hit. &ldquo;Hey you&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo; Neb said.</p></p>

<p><p>Graveller approached them.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not over yet!&rdquo; Nebula said as he charged and punched Graveller&rsquo;s face. *Pow!* He knew it didn&rsquo;t work, but he tried anyway. Marianna followed with a kick to the stomach. Graveller roared and knocked them both away.</p></p>

<p><p>Macintosh: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just too strong a foe to beat&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Junior got into fighting position as Vega approached him. Junior was very scared and trembled as Vega&rsquo;s shadow covered him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So, then, son of Princess Faith, what are you doing out here? Ah, looking for your parents, am I correct.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;T-That&rsquo;s right! What have you done to my mother and father?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Nothing you need to worry about. They will be taken care of soon. Child, come with me and join me. Abandon your parents and be by my side instead. This world will be mine soon.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Abandon my mother and father? Never!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;A foolish decision made in haste. You are too young to understand what&rsquo;s good for you. Come with me and you will not be hurt.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Junior was overtaken by fear, and a little bit of anger. Then he remembered something his mother told him.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith: &ldquo;If you want to become a true young man, then be brave. Face all of your fears.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>That&rsquo;s right, he thought. He must face his fears, no matter how scared he is. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not scared of you!&rdquo; he shouted. He charged and punched.</p></p>

<p><p>Vega blocked his fist. &ldquo;You are as foolish as your father was. Let me teach you a lesson!&rdquo; He punched down, Junior jumped away. Vega attacked with fast, low punches, and Junior dodged them all. &ldquo;Your skills are not bad at all. You have been taught well. Unfortunately, you are stupid!&rdquo; He punched the ground, Junior jumped away.</p></p>

<p><p>The kid charged with a flying kick, and Vega dodged to the side with speed Junior had never seen before. He could not believe his kick missed, and almost fell as he landed. Junior grunted, while Vega remained perfectly calm.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Child, if you persist, you will leave me with no choice.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&#8230;I&rsquo;m not afraid of you!&rdquo; Junior charged wildly, focusing everything he had in the coming attacks. He punched and kicked furiously, but Vega dodged each attack with precision. Junior powered up and charged and did a flying punch, Vega dodged and whacked him on the back. *Whack!* He hit the ground hard. Vega kicked his stomach, knocking him up, then grabbed him with a single hand.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You must realize that you can never defeat me. Never!&rdquo; He tossed the poor kid on the ground, and Junior let out a scream as he landed.</p></p>

<p><p>The kid, with determination, got up, even if it was painful.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I must admit, you are very brave, child. What is your name?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I am Junior, son of Tyson and Faith!&rdquo; he said bravely.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Indeed. You also inherited their brains as well.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, in Junior&rsquo;s eyes, Vega seemed like Mulder. They were both evil, no doubt, they lived to hurt people and hurt him and his parents. They wanted to hurt his mother, and he wasn&rsquo;t gonna let that happen. In a fit of rage he powered up beyond his limits. Blue energy surrounded him, the same energy as Tyson&rsquo;s.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Where is all this power coming from? How can a boy possess such powers?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Junior screamed in anger. He fired the Energy Blast. Vega powered up to form a shield and completely blocked the beam.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Nice try!&rdquo; Vega opened his palm and fired a blast. Boom! Junior was knocked away and laid on the ground.</p></p>

<p><p>Graveller slammed Nebula and Marianna against the wall. When he knew that he was victorious, he pounded his chest and roared like a lion.</p></p>

<p><p>Macintosh was crawling on the ground, not able to move. &ldquo;I think we lost, guys.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo; Zelfire announced. The heroes were surprised he was standing up. Graveller looked at him with pure hatred. Zelfire felt more energized than ever, he felt his confidence coming back. He powered up and charged. &ldquo;Die!&rdquo; He punched furiously and gave a devastating kick in the neck. Graveller barely felt a thing, he punched Zelfire against a boulder. Wham!</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna: &ldquo;Zelfire!!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The defeated warrior sank in misery. He was on his hands and knees, then stood up. &ldquo;Why&#8230;why can&rsquo;t I win?! No matter how hard I train I can&rsquo;t get stronger! There is always a force more powerful than me. First there was Dark Spectre, then Vega, then Prince Mulder&#8230;and now him! If I cannot defeat even him, what good am I? It is as if fate is laughing at me right now!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;No, Zell, you don&rsquo;t have to be like this! You have always been a great warrior, and a good friend.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Macintosh: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s right&#8230;you are not a failure.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to become stronger to win. As long as your spirit gets stronger, then you can do anything! That is what counts!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire: &ldquo;Of course&#8230;why didn&rsquo;t I see this all along?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Graveller: &ldquo;Give me a break. Only strength matters to Graveller.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Take this!&rdquo; Zelfire ran at full speed and kicked Graveller&rsquo;s head off. It rolled on the ground like a ball. Its headless body went to pick up its head and put it back into its place. Zell was about to make another attack, but Graveller shot out his arms, and Zelfire jumped away and landed on a boulder. Suddenly, he had an idea. &ldquo;Hey, you missed, ugly face.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The rock man was extremely enraged at his words. &ldquo;How dare human call me ugly! Human have no right to call me ugly!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;m talking to you. Ugly! Ugly! In fact, you&rsquo;re so ugly you can&rsquo;t even look at a mirror!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Steam came from Graveller&rsquo;s head and his body turned heat red. He screamed and the floor around him shattered. He ran and punched, Zelfire dodged it.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugly! Ugly!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Graveller screamed and punched. Zell kept on jumping to different spots.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna: &ldquo;Using his own anger against him. A very wise strategy.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ace: &ldquo;That rock head ain&rsquo;t so smart.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>*Bam! Bam!* Graveller destroyed boulders as Zelfire jumped around. The two warriors screamed as they ran into each other. Zelfire punched his stomach with the Power Punch. *Wham!* His fist went through Graveller&rsquo;s body, then his body blew up. Pieces of rock remained. The rocks were shaking and floating up.</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire: &ldquo;No, never again!&rdquo; He blasted the rocks into dust. Bam!</p></p>

<p><p>It was over, finally over. Nebula touched Zelfire&rsquo;s shoulder, giving him a warm smile of congratulations.</p></p>


<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="PF_19_A">19: Conclusion of the Dream World: Wake Up! </span></p></center>

<p> <p>Tyson swore to his parents&rsquo; graves that he will get revenge for them, and he will. He and his allies, Ace and Marianna headed off to the castle, and the final battle was about to begin.</p></p>

<p><p>The team of three fought their way through the soldiers and were closer to their goal.</p></p>

<p><p>Meanwhile, waiting in the royal room was Midas, Darian, and Koga.</p></p>

<p><p>Midas: &ldquo;You promise that you will give me your protection?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Koga: &ldquo;Of course, your majesty. All Vega wants is to meet your daughter. He does not intend to harm her in anyway. Grant me that, and I promise I will not let them hurt you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, the door broke down. Three shadow figures appeared in the light.</p></p>

<p><p>Darian drew his sword. &ldquo;We have intruders. You will pay for all your crimes!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;Your majesty, you have killed my parents, and today I am here to take revenge.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ace: &ldquo;Your majesty, so it is true that you made an alliance with Koga. Then our alliance is no more.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Midas: &ldquo;You bunch of traitors! You all die!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darian: &ldquo;Allow me to handle this.&rdquo; He charged alone.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna blocked his attack. Tyson went towards the king as Ace and Koga began to fight.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if you&rsquo;re the king of all of Almerak!&rdquo; Tyson said angrily.</p></p>

<p><p>Midas held a sword and went defensive. &ldquo;I will finish your execution today, young man!&rdquo; They slashed each other.</p></p>

<p><p>Within the castle somewhere, Faith was running towards the throne room. She feared for her life...she definitely did not want to see her loved one and her father kill each other...</p></p>

<p><p>As the three fights continued, Faith finally arrived. She put her hand over her chin and stood by the column, looking in shock. &ldquo;What...what are you all doing? Stop it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darian and Marianna paused the fight. &ldquo;Princess Faith?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna: &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darian: &ldquo;Princess, you better leave at once. This is dangerous!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Stop it father! Tyson! Both of you stop it! Stop fighting!&rdquo; she screamed frantically.</p></p>

<p><p>Midas: &ldquo;Daughter...leave! I must kill this man!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson slashed and Midas blocked.</p></p>

<p><p>Darian: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better if you leave this place, princess. Please!&rdquo; He and Marianna resumed fighting.</p></p>

<p><p>Koga&rsquo;s slashes were so powerful that nearby objects were cut as he swings the sword. Ace kept on dodging the deadly blade. Koga slashed and Ace dodged. The piece of ceiling fell and crashed on Faith.</p></p>

<p><p>Midas: &ldquo;Daughter!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;Faith!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is all your fault! If anything happens to her you will pay!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what you say! I&rsquo;ll have my revenge today!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They slashed violently. Midas kicked him and he fell down the stairs, but got up quickly. Midas ran down and slashed.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna and Prince Darian charged and slashed each other. Marianna collapsed instantly and grunted in pain. Darian thought he had won, but realized he was injured too, and he fell on his blood and died. Marianna smiled, then died as well.</p></p>

<p><p>With Ace on the floor, Koga got his sword and was ready to stab him. &ldquo;Die!&rdquo; he screamed, raising his arms. Ace grabbed a knife in his pants and stabbed Koga&rsquo;s stomach. He thought he was saved, but he coughed blood and his eyes were wide open in surprise. A metal piece stuck out through his stomach. Koga stabbed him through the back, and the sword was facing down since Ace&rsquo;s body was in horizontal position. Both warriors froze for a moment, thinking of death. Koga fell backwards, then Ace fell.</p></p>

<p><p>And of course, the fight between Tyson and the king came to a conclusion as well. Tyson slashed with full force and Midas blocked it. *Clang!* Tyson moved the sword left then hit it towards the right, knocking Midas&rsquo;s weapon away. Then he stabbed him in the stomach. The stabbing sound was loud and clear. King Midas collapsed and died. Tyson his sword drop and he fell on his knees. &ldquo;Mother...father...rest in peace.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith woke up and observed the scene. &ldquo;No...no...this can&rsquo;t be...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> Tyson looked at her. &ldquo;Princess, I am sorry. I killed your father.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tyson..&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You must hate me right now. I don&rsquo;t expect you to forgive me...I had to avenge my parents! I&rsquo;m a criminal now, it&rsquo;s over for me. Goodbye.&rdquo; He began to leave.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was crying. &ldquo;Wait.&rdquo; she said.</p></p>

<p><p>He turned around. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you leave me too. I lost everybody. I have no one now!!! Let us forget about our parents.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Princess...&rdquo; Tyson was completely shocked, but then he accepted what she said.</p></p>

<p><p>They hugged tightly. &ldquo;Tyson...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They let go of each other. &ldquo;Let us never return to this horrible place!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith nodded. They picked up swords and faced each other. They waited, and looked into each other&rsquo;s eyes. They were about to commit suicide. Tyson was very sure of what he was doing, and so was Faith. All of a sudden, the moment before death, he felt out of place, as if he did not belong to this world. It was as if his whole life was nothing but an illusion.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Goodbye.&rdquo; he said.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson slashed his own neck, and then Faith did the same.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson moaned and opened his eyes. The surroundings were unfamiliar. This was definitely not his bedroom. He looked next to him and there was Faith.</p></p>

<p><p>She moaned and woke up. &ldquo;Huh? Tyson?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re both alive?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How did we get here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I remember now! It was Drago&rsquo;s sleeping sand. It was all his doing!&rdquo; They got up and went towards each other.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We should escape right away.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo; Tyson put his hands on Faith&rsquo;s shoulders. She was surprised and curious at what he did. &ldquo;Faith&#8230;&rdquo; he said, looking into her eyes. &ldquo;Did you ever regret being with me?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She answered happily and seriously: &ldquo;No, of course not. I never regretted one second. All I want is someone who loves me for who I am and will stay by my side at all times.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson had expected this kind of answer, but he was not sure he was going to get it. Now, he was glad and smiled. &ldquo;Then let us end what we started seven years ago. Now that our homes are united, we will unite and defeat Vega!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith nodded.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How touching.&rdquo; said Drago, coming into the room. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame that will not happen.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;So, you are the one who created that horrible nightmare.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith: &ldquo;Alas, we are awake now. You no longer have power over us.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Drago: &ldquo;You two are of no use to me any longer! Prepare to die.&rdquo; He gathered energy and was about to attack.</p></p>

<p><p>The couple disappeared, then appeared in front of him. Tyson punched his face. *Pow!* Drago fell. They ran into the next room.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, let&rsquo;s get out of this place!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Then they saw Lisa in a bubble.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith: &ldquo;Lees, is that you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Guys, you&rsquo;re awake! Thank goodness. I was so worried.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. We&rsquo;ll get you down.&rdquo; She threw a rose at the bubble, and it popped. Lisa fell and Tyson caught her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They looked behind and saw fireballs shooting at them. &ldquo;Run!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;You two go ahead. I will take care of Drago.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith: &ldquo;But-&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Just go. Now!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The two women escaped. Tyson faced Drago alone.</p></p>



<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="PF_20_A">20: Trapped in Space: A Race Against Time! </span></p></center>

<p> <p>Tyson: &ldquo;Why did you make that horrible dream? What was the purpose of it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Drago: &ldquo;I just wanted to learn about the thing you call &lsquo;love&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Because if that is what helped you defeat Vega seven years ago, it is worth studying.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hah. Some one like you could never understand what love is.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmmmph.&rdquo; he said in a cocky tone. &ldquo;I no longer need to learn it, since you are nothing! I thought you&rsquo;d be more of a challenge for me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well, if you didn&rsquo;t use that sleeping sand, you wouldn&rsquo;t have won. You and your cheap tricks.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Speaking of tricks, I&rsquo;d like to show you one. One that you will never forget.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson was cautious and defensive.</p></p>

<p><p>Drago folded his hands and chanted something. Then they both disappeared and reappeared in the inter-dimensional gateway. Tyson was shocked to find himself in such a strange place. The entire place was a void, it was nothing. The sky and ground, which was none, were just swirling patterns of red and yellow. They were standing on one of many meteorites floating around.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&#8230;what is this place?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This, my friend, is the inter-dimensional portal. This is the place where I merged the two dimensions together.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson looked in awe. &ldquo;So this is the inter-dimensional portal. Why did you bring us here, huh?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What do you think, Tyson Spade? Don&rsquo;t you see? You&rsquo;re finished! Ha ha ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Only a wizard such as I have access to this place. I can enter and leave this place freely, although it costs a lot of energy. You on the other hand have no way of leaving.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson was worried now.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;See? Either I kill you now, or you kill me, but you&rsquo;re stuck here...for all eternity! Ha ha ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Grrrr. I choose the third option - I&rsquo;m going to beat you up and make you send me back!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You can try!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson charged and punched. &ldquo;Yahhhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Drago blocked and kicked with his knee. Tyson blocked the knee and did a kick, aiming for Drago&rsquo;s face. Drago dodged by bending his back and moving his head backwards. Tyson punched and he dodged sideways. They jumped up and kicked and hit each other on the knees. Wham! They landed and stayed a distance away.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No more Mr. Nice Guy!&rdquo; Tyson turned Super Sayan. His golden light was an eyesore (literally) to Drago.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well, then. Let us finish this!&rdquo; He attacked with a fierce combo of punches.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson blocked them all with ease, and punched Drago in the guts. *Pow!* They beat the crap out of each other, and Tyson was winning. *Pow! Bam! Wham!*</p></p>

<p><p>Derik entered Skull Mountain. (It seems that my father is not here. I cannot sense him or Tyson anywhere. Could he have gone <strong>there</strong>?)</p></p>

<p><p>Lisa and Faith ran outside, planning to escape somewhere, most likely Macintosh&rsquo;s lab. Faith was worried about Tyson, and she looked back.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Lisa screamed. Faith wondered what it was. Vega appeared front of Lisa and she screamed. He smacked her and she fell down.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No Lisa!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She was facing the other way so her face was unseen and she wasn&rsquo;t moving so she must be unconscious.</p></p>

<p><p>Vega let out his signature laughter. &ldquo;Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So&#8230;you <strong>are</strong>alive after all. I would not believe it until I saw it with my own eyes.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We meet again at last, Princess of Almerak. But that title is meaningless now, since most of your kingdom is gone!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She summoned her swords. &ldquo;Why did you come back, Vega? Why!?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I have unfinished business here. I will not let you ruin my plans again!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith charged and slashed. Vega dodged to the side quickly, surprising Faith. What speed he has, she thought. She kept on slashing and he dodged every attack. Vega decided to go offensive. On his left hand was a claw, and he stabbed at her. She blocked with her Soul Sword and the collision made a metallic sound. *Clang* They struggled and Faith was pushed back.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I shall kill you Vega!&rdquo; Faith leapt into the air and so did he. She kicked him and he fell. While still in the air, she performed the Spin Dive Attack. Her entire body was spinning in the air, with her swords rotating like a helicopter.</p></p>

<p><p>Vega fired a beam and hit her directly, but the force was pushing the beam down, and she smashed into Vega. *Kaboom!* Faith jumped out of the explosion and waited for the smoke to clear out. To her surprise, her enemy was okay.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still alive?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My power is much greater than we last met. Over these seven years, I have drained much energy from various life forms.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You never change.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Neither do you. Why don&rsquo;t you just surrender and make it quick?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo; She slashed with her two blades. *Whoosh!*</p></p>

<p><p>Vega dodged while stepping back. She kept on slashing non-stop and Vega blocked with his claw. Suddenly, he shot out tentacles from his sleeve. *Bang!* They were like long metallic ropes. Luckily, she was fast enough to jump away as the tentacles hit the ground and cracked it. Vega retracted the tentacles, and they went back into him. Faith combined the two swords into one, then charged and slashed. Vega dodged and kicked her and then she fell. But she recovered quickly.</p></p>

<p><p>Lisa crawled towards her friend. &ldquo;F-Faith&#8230;&rdquo; She fell unconscious.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith sensed someone else near the area. It&rsquo;s Junior! Her eyeballs darted to the right, then went back to Vega. She jumped towards the right and Vega followed. &ldquo;My son!&rdquo; she said, going towards the kid. &ldquo;Junior!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Junior moaned unconsciously.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It was too bad. Your son was very resistant like you, but unfortunately, he was too weak to even hurt me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was extremely angry inside. &ldquo;You have made the biggest mistake of your life. Nobody hurts my son and gets away with it.&rdquo; She got up and pointed the sword at him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You have no idea of the greatness of my plan, do you? Let me tell you, I will not repeat my past mistakes. My full-proof plan cannot fail!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Your plan to make me and Tyson sleep?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That was Drago&rsquo;s part. Do you know how hard it is to find a sorcerer of his caliber? One who can merge the dimensions? Because of his rare talent I agreed to his conditions. I was going to have you and Tyson killed, but Drago wanted you alive to do tests on you. I have completed what I could not have done seven years ago. Since the merger is complete, I am one step close to having my goals fulfilled.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So you merged the dimensions so that it&rsquo;ll be easier for you to rule the world, is that right?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes! It is too bad the process is irreversible. With the world in its chaotic state, the military forces are weakened, and my army will triumph. By now, Drago&rsquo;s students should have killed your friends. And as we speak now, Drago is killing your beloved Tyson Spade. And finally, I will kill you. Then it will be all over.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No&#8230;Tyson will not lose!&rdquo; she yelled.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Fool! Don&rsquo;t you know Drago has sent him to the inter-dimension portal? There is no escape for him! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&#8230;impossible! Even if he&rsquo;s trapped there he can still win!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You can keep thinking that.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That is because I believe in him fully. You will never understand what love is.&rdquo; She stuck the sword into the ground. &ldquo;Ground Crusher!&rdquo; The sword released energy into the dirt and made a crack towards Vega. The crack turned into a hole and exploded. Vega jumped away.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Without Tyson, you are nothing! I underestimated your combined powers, but individually you are nothing!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>These words were weapons that pierced Faith&rsquo;s pride. It made her angry and motivated to attack. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she screamed. &ldquo;That is not true! I will defeat you alone!&rdquo; She charged wildly.</p></p>


<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="PF_21_A">21: Desperate Measures. The Unexpected Ally </span></p></center>

<p> <p>Can Princess Faith defeat the powerful Vega alone? And will Tyson be able to escape the portal and save his family?</p></p>

<p><p>Super Sayan Tyson and Drago stared at each other, waiting for the right moment to make a move.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tyson, you know you will die sooner or later.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: (I can&rsquo;t die here! I&rsquo;m a Super Sayan. There has to be a way out of here.)<br>  They hit each other with punches and kicks. Tyson was thinking of Faith and it distracted him. Drago punched him right in the cheek. *Pow!* He spit saliva and hit the floor. Drago gathered energy.</p></p>

<p><p>(He&rsquo;s right&#8230;I am trapped in this place. How can I escape? If I die, then&#8230;how am I going to keep my promise to Faith?)</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tyson&#8230;promise me&#8230;promise me you will stay with me forever.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>(I have to keep my promise and live! Wait for me Faith! I&rsquo;m coming to you soon!) Drago punched and Tyson grabbed his fist. &ldquo;I will never let you beat me, Drago!&rdquo; He squeezed Drago&rsquo;s fist. Drago grabbed his hand, trying to get his hand free. Tyson used his other hand and punched Drago&rsquo;s face. *Pow!* Then Tyson kicked his chest. *Wham!* He was knocked to the other side of the meteorite.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson fired the Energy Blast and Drago jumped to another meteorite. He fired a bunch of energy balls and hit the piece of land Tyson was standing on. He backed away and pieces of rock fell off. They shot energy beams and energy balls at each other and jumped to different meteorites. Things exploded every second &ndash; boom boom boom! Beams flew all over the place.</p></p>

<p><p>Drago fired a beam, then Tyson dodged, reappeared near his enemy, then kicked him down. *Whack!* He crashed into the floor.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Looks like it is time to show you what I really can do.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You were holding back?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My power is much more than meets the eye.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The Sayan waited as Drago powered up. He was full of spiritual energy, and very strong. His body glowed and Tyson watched in shock.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson ran and prepared to punch. Drago fired a beam at Tyson&rsquo;s chest and blasted him away. Bam! His shirt was burned to dust. A few pieces of it fell down. Tyson breathed hard. &ldquo;This is the power you wanted to show me?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The wizard smiled. &ldquo;Let us get on with this!&rdquo; He took off his shirt. There was a dragon symbol on his chest and a smaller one on his right arm. That was what glowed.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson noticed his muscles were as big as his, but the symbol caught more of his attention. &ldquo;You have a tattoo?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is my birthmark, fool! It is the foundation of my power.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now I know why you are named what you are.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Come Tyson, let us continue our duel. It&rsquo;s mano a mano!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I like your attitude! Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They continued to fight. Drago was as physically strong as the Super Sayan was. Now it was a test of strength and endurance.</p></p>

<p><p>Princess Faith charged wildly and slashed at Vega, who jumped and landed on another spot. She ran towards him again. Vega shot tentacles and she ducked while still running. She hit his stomach, running past him, and stopped.</p></p>

<p><p>He was not injured. &ldquo;Nice try.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What does it take to kill you?!&rdquo; She ran at him, hoping to be aggressive enough, so that he will not have a chance to fight back.</p></p>

<p><p>Vega shot out tentacles and tied up Faith&rsquo;s arm, and tied up her sword. He pulled it from her and it fell on the ground somewhere. With her arm tied up, he pulled her towards him. Her feet scraped the dirt as she was dragged. She took out a rose and its stem extended. She cut the tentacle.</p></p>

<p><p>Vega fired a beam and Faith threw three roses at it, causing it to explode too soon. *Boom!* She could not see Vega and became cautious. He appeared behind her and she turned around. *Whoosh!* He struck with his claw. &ldquo;You die!!!&rdquo; She ducked just in time.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith used the rose whip and whipped at him and he dodged. The thorns hit the dirt and cracked it. Vega stuck his arms into the ground, and tentacles came out from under her. *Crack!* She was caught off guard. Luckily, she jumped away and avoided injury.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I am not the same person you knew before!&rdquo; Faith announced. She powered up to maximum, and a shield of pink energy surrounded her. Electric sparks flared, and rocks near her were blown away.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Impressive. But I am not the same either!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith threw the rose and he caught it. *Boom!* Smoke covered him. She charged and kicked him &ndash; wham! She used the Tiger Fist and punched his chest. *Bam!*</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ahhhhhhhhhh!&rdquo; Vega screamed.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith then fired the Mega Beam, a super strong beam full of spiritual energy.</p></p>

<p><p> Vega took the hit but his shield blasted the beam to smithereens. &ldquo;Ha ha ha ha!&rdquo; He fired a red beam and hit Faith, pushing her into the building. *Crash!*</p></p>

<p><p>A minute later, Faith recovered, with dust on her. Pieces of the wall laid on the floor. She coughed and breathed hard. Not only was her body damaged, but so was her motivation. She spent a lot of energy on the Mega Beam. Not only did it not work, but she received more damage than her enemy.</p></p>

<p><p>Vega came in from the hole. &ldquo;How will your powers save you now?&rdquo; he taunted.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson and Drago hurt each other really bad. Tyson let out a combo of fists, and they were so fast it looked like he had four arms. Drago dodged all of them, then did a high kick, hitting Tyson&rsquo;s chin. *Wham!* Tyson kicked, Drago blocked with his arm, then pushed his leg away. Tyson almost fell backwards, and Drago punched him really hard in the face. He flipped over and fell face flat. The Super Sayan got back up like nothing happened, and the warriors ran into each other.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, a bright glowing object appeared in front of them. They stopped. Derik came out from the light, then the light vanished. &ldquo;So you two are here!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Derik? It&rsquo;s you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Derik?&rdquo; asked his father. &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Father&#8230;why did you take Tyson here? You two have to stop fighting.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What? You are not needed here, boy.&rdquo; said the wizard. &ldquo;Go back to Skull Mountain and await my orders.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Derik said.</p></p>

<p><p>It was a shock for him to disobey. &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;While being away, I have learned something very important. What we are doing is wrong. Very wrong. Father, your ways will only bring chaos and suffering to the world.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;So, Derik, you finally understand.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Stupid boy! I did not raise you to be like this. Whatever you have been told is wrong. They are tricking you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, father. This lesson I learned myself from what I saw and experienced. Father, please stop before it&rsquo;s too late!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;Drago, even your son has learned his lesson. Shouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Shut up Sayan! This is none of your concern.&rdquo; He was about to attack but Derik stood between them, spreading out his arms.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Stop this. This is wrong.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Traitor! Get out of my way.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I cannot&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Drago smacked his son to the floor. Tyson was outraged and punched the wizard in the face. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your own son!!! Don&rsquo;t you care about anyone at all?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Drago blocked the next punch. &ldquo;This is&#8230;none of your concern!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They continued fighting, jumping to another meteorite. Derik watched helplessly.</p></p>

<p><p>The warriors gathered energy, putting everything they had into it. Tyson fired the Wrath Beam and it smashed into Drago&rsquo;s beam. *Boom!* The explosion occurred in the middle and its force caused the meteorite to go off orbit. It separated from the others, and since no gravitational force was pulling on it, it did not stop. The warriors were knocked down and did not notice.</p></p>

<p><p>Derik: &ldquo;Father, Tyson, are you alright?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo; the wizard replied.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You should listen to your son. He does care about you, you know.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Derik: &ldquo;Guys&#8230;the meteorite is moving away. You better get off now or it will move further.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Drago: &ldquo;Regardless, our duel must continue. Neither one of us goes back until one of us dies!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re insane!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You know that is what you want too, Spade!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They punched on the fist. *Wham!* Tyson could&rsquo;ve sworn his knuckles broke. The shockwave created shook the floor.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith threw the whip at Vega and he shot out tentacles. *Bang!* The whip and tentacles were tied up and went around each other. The thorns cut the strings as Vega shot out strings from his other arm. It grabbed Faith and lifted her off her feet. She was slammed into a column. *Bam! Crash!* The column fell.</p></p>

<p><p>Vega shot tentacles string and they slammed her against the wall.</p></p>

<p><p>She was unable to move and struggled. &ldquo;Uhhh&#8230;uhhhh&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I have you now. You can&rsquo;t escape!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Noooo!&rdquo; Suddenly, the Soul Sword, as if it sensed its master&rsquo;s cry for help, moved by itself, flying to Faith. She caught it in her hand and cut the strings. The sword glowed. She slashed and Vega dodged. The sword was so powerful that one swing can make a shockwave out of wind. The floor and the wall cracked.</p></p>

<p><p>Vega shot an energy ball, and Faith jumped up. Her feet bounced off the wall and her body flew towards him. She used the Dive Needle Attack, a move similar to the Spin Dive Attack, only she was spinning with her sword pointing down, so that it was like a drill, the point of the sword could break even concrete stone. Vega blocked with his claw, slashing the blade, but his claw broke and she slashed his arm. Then she kicked him in the stomach and landed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That was nothing.&rdquo; the tyrant said.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith noticed that the part where she cut his arm were wires. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a machine?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You can consider me both a machine and a human in one. My injuries will be repaired automatically.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I know what you really are &ndash; a monster!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I see your attitude has not changed either. I have studied you and the others for quite a while now. I believe that if you know your enemy well enough, you can beat them. I know everything there is to know about you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;All of us?&rdquo; Faith asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, every single one of you. I know that you can heal others. But you cannot heal yourself, is that right? So once I get rid of you, you won&rsquo;t be able to heal others.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You want to kill me?! Go ahead!&rdquo; She fired an energy ball.</p></p>

<p><p>Vega dodged it and kicked her. *Wham!* She was knocked a few feet away.</p></p>

<p><p>In the inter-dimensional portal, the warriors were getting ready to attack. Tyson noticed some thunder above. (Could it be a magnetic storm?) he thought.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sayan, ready or not, here I come!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Bring it on!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I will show you a move you have never seen yet. It is called the Dragon Punch. Now you can witness its power!&rdquo; He raised his right arm, and his muscles grew a bit. Veins popped up. Energy went into his hand and its aura grew. He ran at Tyson, and yelled the name of the move.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson ran at him, using the Tiger Fist, and he yelled it out. Their fists hit and created a shockwave. Rock pieces flew in the air and their bodies shook and trembled. They were knocked away by the force. Tyson and Drago grabbed their paralyzed arms.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Uhhhh&#8230;my arm&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The warriors continued fighting, hurting each other badly. They punched in the face recklessly. Bruises appeared all over their bodies, but they continued despite the pain. These muscle men were not gonna go easy on each other.</p></p>

<p><p>They jumped in the air and kicked in the chest. *Wham!* They fell on their backs.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was injured and tired, and she could barely stand up straight. Vega mocked her weakness. &ldquo;Ha ha ha! What&rsquo;s the matter? How can the Great Spirit save you now?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Derik: &ldquo;They are still fighting&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;Drago, we must stop this foolish fighting or both of us will be lost in the void forever!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No! This will end right here and now. One of us die, or both of us die together!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re insane!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Goodbye, Tyson!&rdquo; He folded his hands and closed his eyes, chanting something. Spirit energy from his body went to the air, taking the shape of a dragon.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What the hell is this?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Drago opened his eyes, and the Dragon Spirit Wave charged at Tyson. He jumped, and it followed him. *Vrrrooom!* Tyson formed the Electro-shield, but the wave was too strong! He struggled with it, holding it back, trying not to let his body fall apart in the air. The spirit was being destroyed as it touched the shield and disintegrated.</p></p>

<p><p>Drago fired a bunch of needles at him and Tyson blocked all of it. Suddenly, the wizard appeared behind Tyke, and whacked him down. *Bam!* Drago landed and approached. Tyson was on the very edge of the meteorite, and he was trapped.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha. See ya in hell!&rdquo; Drago fired a beam, Tyson jumped, then Drago did a flying kick on his chest and he fell off.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson grabbed on to the side of the meteor. His fingers were slipping as he held on.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Fall damn you.&rdquo; Drago blasted the edge. Rocks fell and almost hit Tyke.</p></p>

<p><p>He was hanging on and climbed sideways.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see him?&rdquo; As he searched, the ground blasted and Tyson popped up.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Surprise!!!&rdquo; *Pow!* The Super Sayan gave him a good punch in the cheek. He was on top of him and kept hitting.</p></p>

<p><p>Drago grabbed Tyson&rsquo;s face and tried to push him away. They grunted and struggled. They rolled over each other and hit. Drago kicked him away. He got up and charged. Tyke grabbed him and did an overhead throw, making his enemy fall on his back.</p></p>

<p><p>(Crap&#8230;I&rsquo;m losing balance. Is it the gravity?) &ldquo;Is it just me or am I feeling lighter? Are you feeling the same?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It seems that the storm is drawing this meteorite into it. We are being pulled in little by little.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Then we have to stop this non-sense now, before we both die.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ha! I never guessed you&rsquo;re such a coward. The gravity will not get in the way of our fight.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You are mad!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we all?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They leapt into each other and hit on the knees. *Thud* Tyson punched, and Drago jumped and landed behind him. It seemed they could move a little bit faster. However, time was running out for the hero.</p></p>

<p><p>Vega&rsquo;s eyes narrowed and glowed red. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s obvious that you lost. Why give your worthless life away?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith had a bruise on her forehead and her mouth was bleeding. Her sleeve was torn. She glared at Vega with nothing but hatred in her eyes.</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="PF_22_A">22: Spirit vs Strength: The Princess's Stand </span></p></center>

<p> <p>Vega was confident in his victory. &ldquo;You are finished, princess. The war has been lost. There is no hope for you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong, Vega. There is <strong>always</strong>hope. There will always be people like you, hurting innocent people for greed and power&#8230;but whenever there is evil, there is justice. Only you would think that fighting for justice and doing the right thing is futile. Ultimately, only the forces of good and love will triumph. It is something you will never understand!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Do you really think you can win?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith took out a rose and looked at it. (Please, O Great Spirit, give me the strength and courage to fight.) She gathered energy for the Energy Bomb. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve ruined Almerak, but I will not let you destroy this home as well.&rdquo; She threw the bomb at him, and Vega fired a gigantic beam and smashed the bomb, and hit Faith, pushing her out of the building. She was on the ground, barely able to move. The beam left a trail on the ground, and it was burning.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What is the matter? Things don&rsquo;t look so good for you now, princess.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;D-Damn you&#8230;&rdquo; she mumbled.</p></p>

<p><p>The warriors continued to fight to the death in the gateway of dimensions. Their bodies weigh less on the meteorite and it became harder to control their movements each second. Tyson was less willing to fight, but Drago did not care if they die.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Stop this madness! You are making a big mistake, Drago.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. All I care is if you die! So die!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re insane!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They hit each other badly. Bruises were on their chests and stomach, face and forehead. Tyson was bleeding from the mouth, and he wiped the blood off. They flew to the air and fought like there was no tomorrow.</p></p>

<p><p>Derik, watching the meteorite get smaller and smaller, grew more worried. &ldquo;Father&#8230;just stop!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Drago punched, Tyson blocked with his wrist. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see you have a son who cares about you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is none of your damn business!&rdquo; He kicked.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson ducked, then punched his stomach. &ldquo;You have no idea how lucky you are.&rdquo; He meant it. He had a son too, Junior, who did not like his father that much. Just give him some time, Faith said. Will he eventually accept his father?</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson fired the Wrath Beam, and the wizard once again used the Drago Punch. *Bam!* He punched through the beam like it was nothing, and he punched Tyson, knocking him away fast.</p></p>

<p><p>As the Super Sayan got back to his feet, he realized it was even more difficult to maintain balance. They were getting closer and closer to the storm each second. (Damn&#8230;this can&rsquo;t go on. How can I fight like this?)</p></p>

<p><p>Drago, of course, was experiencing the same problem.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Guys! You have to get out of there!&rdquo; Derik yelled at the top of his lungs.</p></p>

<p><p>The warriors ran forward, but then their feet went off the floor and they were floating. Tyson struggled to maintain control, and landed on his feet. He forced himself not to float, but it was hard.</p></p>

<p><p>Drago jumped and punched, and he jumped higher than he wanted to, Tyson appeared in front of him and knocked him down. After that, things were not so smooth. Strong winds appeared and made it so that it was even more difficult for them to stay on the ground. Rock chunks broke apart from the meteorite and went up.</p></p>

<p><p>For the warriors, it was now a struggle to stay down.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was blasted and slammed on the dirt. *Boom!* She got up, thinking of nothing but beating her long time enemy.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Blast you. What does it take for you to stay down?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith moaned painfully, trying to ignore her wounds. &ldquo;I will never stay down. Do you know why?&rdquo; It was rhetorical question. &ldquo;Because I am fighting for everything that is important to me!! I will not let you take away my family, home, my life, my freedom!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Foolish humans. Is that what motivates you to fight?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, it is more than just motivation. It is everything to me. Because you threaten to take everything away that is precious to me, I will not stop until I die! I will use every last ounce of energy I have left to fight you to the death. Even if you&rsquo;re a million times stronger than me, I will not surrender! Even if I barely have enough energy to survive, I use every last bit of it and fight you to the end.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Does love mean that much to you?&rdquo;<br>  &ldquo;What would you know about love, Vega?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Love is but an illusion for fools! The real true thing that is worth anything is power. Once I have achieved the conquest of the world, I will eliminate this thing you call love.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You must know this: you can beat me down, you can hurt my son, but you will never destroy my spirit. As long as my spirit remains strong, I have hope. You see, every single thing in the universe has a spirit&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;&#8230;And with this spirit comes power. This is what gives me power, this is what gives me confidence, this is what gives me hope&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith: &ldquo;&#8230;And most importantly, this is what gives me strength to defeat you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;You see, Drago, that is why you can never win. You may kill me, but my friends and family will continue to fight in my place.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Such a touching speech.&rdquo; Vega replied with sarcasm. &ldquo;Then I shall break your spirit; shatter it into pieces so small you cannot even see it. I want to see your face when I rule the world and you have nothing.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Despite her injuries, Faith charged wildly and attacked. Her actions defy all logic. Winning or losing meant nothing now. She&rsquo;s not fighting just for survival - no - she was fighting for things beyond herself - things she value more than her own life. She did a flying kick, which Vega evaded, then she punched, and blocked and kicked her away.</p></p>

<p><p>This time, she really couldn&rsquo;t get up, so she just crawled forward.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is such a pathetic sight. Let me put you out of your misery.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hold it right there!&rdquo; yelled a familiar voice.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith wondered who it was, and was surprised to see Nebula and the rest of the gang. Zell, Ace, Marianne, and Mac came out from the trees. They stood in front of Faith, facing Vega.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So you are all still alive? No matter. I have enough energy to take on all of you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire: &ldquo;Prepare to meet your end, Vega!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ace: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re dead!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>All the heroes except Faith attacked him at once. They surrounded him and used their best attacks. *Pow! Wham! Bam! Whack! Crack!* Nebula and Ace were down. Mac was down. *Pow* Zelfire was down.</p></p>

<p><p>Meanwhile, in the inter-dimensional portal, things looked more dangerous than ever as Tyson and Drago hang on for their dear lives. They had their knees bent and their fingers grabbed the ground firmly. Rock chunks were all over the place, floating upwards.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson decided to take a risk and charged and punched Drago in the face. *Pow!* Drago flipped several times and grabbed the ground. Tyson was caught in the wind, but he forced himself down and held onto a piece of rock sticking out.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ahhhhhhhh!&rdquo; screamed Tyson.</p></p>

<p><p>They were losing their grip. A few rock pieces hit Drago&rsquo;s face and he lost his grip, and he was sucked into the void. It was too late for him to get back now. &ldquo;Noooooooooo! Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyke was left alone now, losing his grip. &ldquo;Uuuugh&#8230;&rdquo; The gravitational force of the storm became so strong that the entire meteorite was being sucked up, breaking apart on the way. Tyson&rsquo;s legs hung in the air and his hands held the ground.</p></p>

<p><p>Derik: &ldquo;Tyson! Here!&rdquo; He shot a long tentacle towards the meteorite. Was it long enough to reach him? Yes!</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson crawled towards it, and reached. Reeeeeeeeeeeeeach! He got it! He managed to grab it with both hands. &ldquo;Okay!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Derik retracted the tentacle. Tyson was taken to safety.</p></p>

<p><p>After catching his breath, he looked at Derik. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, thank you Tyson, for teaching me things I never knew before.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I am sorry about your father. I tried to save him, I really did. He&rsquo;s gone&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He sighed and tears came. &ldquo;My father was arrogant to the very end. I hurt your wife and you killed my father. Let us call it even.&rdquo; He smiled.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson knew he meant well. Maybe they can be friends after all. What Derik said was sort of sad, but in a way, they <strong>were</strong>even.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What will we do now? We are stuck here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I can take us out of here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Really? That&rsquo;s great!&rdquo; Tyson exclaimed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But-&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I used up some energy coming here. I need to recharge.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How long?! Please make it quick.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Derik: &ldquo;Patience.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Even though I&rsquo;m here, I know Fay is in danger. I have to help.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We cannot do a thing until I recharge. Why not you recharge your ki while you wait?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson sighed. &ldquo;I suppose, I don&rsquo;t have much of a choice.&rdquo; He sat down in lotus position.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna stood a safe distance from melee fighters and loaded up an arrow into her bow. &ldquo;Celestial Arrow!&rdquo; The arrow glowing with ki pierced Vega&rsquo;s chest, causing him to groan.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugggh! How dare you!&rdquo; Vega&rsquo;s tentacles ripped the arrow out and smashed it into pieces. Ace was up high and he slashed. Vega smacked him away. *Wham*</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna loaded another arrow. Vega blurred and appeared in front of he in the blink of an eye. She gasped and had no time to react. The tentacles stabbed her and she fell.</p></p>

<p><p>Within minutes, all the heroes were on the floor. The villain was high on his power trip. &ldquo;Ha ha ha ha! Is that all your so called spirit has to offer?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith still had some strength left. Pink ki floated up to the sky while she crawled up. She stood on her feet and confronted Vega. &ldquo;This is not o-over y-et.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Still want to fight? Haven&rsquo;t you had enough?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is for my home!&rdquo; She fired the Energy Bomb.</p></p>

<p><p>Vega jumped up, dodging the deadly ball of energy. He landed and punched Faith in the stomach, leaving her barely conscious. He grabbed her by the head and lifted her up. She moaned. &ldquo;It was nice knowing you.&rdquo; In his right hand, tentacles came out, and he was ready to stab her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Put her down.&rdquo; Ace said. &ldquo;Let go of my sister.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You are still alive?&rdquo; Vega saw that all the heroes were standing, despite their injuries. &ldquo;Very well then. I will kill you last, princess, so you can witness their deaths while being helpless.&rdquo; He threw her away like trash.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna helped her best friend up. &ldquo;You alright?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been worse.&rdquo; she replied with spunk.</p></p>

<p><p>Vega was not pleased. &ldquo;What does it take for you to stay down?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire: &ldquo;By now you should realize that you can never beat us down.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;We beat you once, and we can do it again. Even if Tyson is not here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mac fired a continuous beam of electricity and Vega blocked it with his right hand. Zelfire fired the Energy Blast and he blocked with his left.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula opened up his right palm and gathered ki as his left hand was holding onto his right wrist for support. He was going to use his signature final move - the Nebulon Blast.</p></p>

<p><p>Using brute force Vega pushed the beams away. He appeared in front of Mac and punched him away. Zell dashed to his friend&rsquo;s rescue. The tyrant fired an energy ball that hit Zell&rsquo;s stomach, knocking him away.</p></p>

<p><p>Ace was out of sight this whole time and he appeared behind Vega and gave him a bear hug. From this position Vega was unable to get himself free. &ldquo;Do it now Nebula!&rdquo; he yelled.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula released the blue ball of energy known as the Nebulon Blast. Vega&rsquo;s feet became tentacles and lifted himself with Ace into the air. The Nebulon Blast went through the tentacles and exploded in the background.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No way!&rdquo; Ace exclaimed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Did you think you could hold me, human?&rdquo; Vega&rsquo;s arms became tentacles, reached behind him and grabbed Ace, pulling him in front of him. Nebula charged forward. Vega threw Ace into Nebula.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson sat impatiently His legs and arms were crossed. &ldquo;Derik, are you done yet? Hurry up.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I am almost done. Please be patient. Asking me every two seconds will not speed up the process.&rdquo; He continued to meditate, closing his eyes and standing up.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: (Faith, Junior, and everybody else&#8230;please hold on. I am coming soon. You have to survive.)</p></p>

<p><p>Everyone was beaten down again. Despite the lack of strength, Faith still had her will and courage. It took a lot to get back on her feet, and when she did, she could barely lift a finger. &ldquo;Vega&#8230;&rdquo; Each step she took almost made her fell. &ldquo;I&#8230;will&#8230;not&#8230;lose&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vega blasted her with an energy ball and that&rsquo;s enough to make her fall. Despite her situation she was still unwilling to accept defeat. Her eyes became filled with tears of frustration. &ldquo;Why&#8230;why!! I did everything I could. But that&rsquo;s still not enough. What must I do?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vega: &ldquo;Ohhh don&rsquo;t look so sad. It will end soon enough.&rdquo; His tentacles transformed into an axe. He approached her and raised the axe up.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, a bright light flared in front of Faith. Everyone had to cover their eyes. Tyson and Derik appeared standing shoulder by shoulder.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith gasped. &ldquo;Tyson?! Derik?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vega was equally surprised. &ldquo;Tyson Spade?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>No one even mentioned the miraculous timing of which these two teleported here. A moment later and Faith would be dead. But that makes them seem more of gift from heaven.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson had time to heal and recharge his ki. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about a thing. We can handle it from here.&rdquo;</p></p>


<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="PF_23_A">23: Sunrise Appears: Light in the Darkness. </span></p></center>

<p> <p>&ldquo;So, Vega is alive. I wouldn&rsquo;t have believed it if I haven&rsquo;t seen it with my own eyes.&rdquo; Tyson said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Be careful!&rdquo; warned Faith, with much worry. &ldquo;He is dangerous.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;We can handle it from here. Derik, take care of her and the others.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Derik: &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vega: &ldquo;Ahhh, if it isn&rsquo;t Tyson Spade. If you&rsquo;re here that means Drago failed. No matter, he lived up to his use. Although I did not plan on meeting you, it is my pleasure to see you again, for I have the pleasure of killing you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Get out of here now.&rdquo; Tyson said to Derik and Faith.</p></p>

<p><p>Derik helped Faith, carrying her arm, and they walked away.</p></p>

<p><p>Vega: &ldquo;You really do think you can win, do you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Drago could not kill me, so I can believe what I want.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I will beat you just like I beat your allies! You will die faster than you know it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson powered up and became full of blue energy.</p></p>

<p><p>Vega shot an energy ball.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson dodged it, then charged and slammed into Vega, and pushed him into the building. *Crash* Suddenly, Vega slashed with his claw, and Tyson jumped away just in time.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Take this.&rdquo; The tyrant blasted Tyson against the wall. Tyson hurt his back, and fell, and the wall cracked from the center. &ldquo;You were never a match for me. Without the Spirit Bomb, you are nothing.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wrong&#8230;&rdquo; He got up. &ldquo;Over these years, I developed a new technique that allows me to gain power that even I did not think I could do.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyke smiled confidently. &ldquo;Allow me to show you. The Super Sayan!&rdquo; He powered up and transformed into a Super Sayan. His hair turned bright gold and his body let out a golden flash. &ldquo;This is a Super Sayan.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Uhhhh, impressive!&rdquo; Vega said. &ldquo;I never heard of it, but I get to see it with my own eyes. Yes, this was the power I&rsquo;ve been looking for all along!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I am not the same person you knew seven years ago.&rdquo; Tyson charged and gave his enemy a fierce combo in super speed. Vega never had a chance to fight back, so he got hit many times.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Very good. I have also improved. He he he he.&rdquo; Vega drew energy from the Silver Crystal, which was very far away, hidden in a secret location. He became filled with red energy, and his cape was waving from the force.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: (Where is he getting that energy from?)</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Your demise is at hand!&rdquo; *Bam!* He fired a beam.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson dodged. Vega gave him a knee jam right in the guts, Tyson spit saliva and it really hurt. Vega whacked him on the back and he fell down. Then he used the Freeze Ray, and Tyson bounced up and evaded. A piece of the floor was frozen.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How does a Super Sayan statue sound?&rdquo; Vega kept on using the Freeze Ray, but it was not fast enough for the Sayan. *Zap, zap, zap.*</p></p>

<p><p>After dodging several times, Tyson fired the Energy Bomb. *Boom* Vega took it like a pinch.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Time to heat things up.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vega fired a large beam and Tyson countered with the Wrath Beam. The energies collided as expected, but what they didn&rsquo;t expect was that the explosion caused the whole building to explode. The warriors shielded themselves as hell let loose. Pieces of the building flew all over the place. *Kaboom*</p></p>

<p><p>Faith had only a little bit of energy left but still insisted on healing everyone. Derik transferred most of his ki to her so she could recover some strength. Firstly, she healed Junior. Then everyone else was healed one by one.</p></p>

<p><p>The boy&rsquo;s eyes opened. &ldquo;Mommy?&rdquo; he murmured.</p></p>

<p><p>His mother let out a smile. &ldquo;Thank goodness.&rdquo; she said happily. She let him stand up on his own.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;Hey kid, you alright? Glad to see that.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire: &ldquo;Thank you so much, Faith. You healed us even though you had so little energy left.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing, guys. We are a family, right?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Derik: &ldquo;So this is what it&rsquo;s like to be in a family.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Macintosh: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;ve met before. Are you Derik?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; he answered.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith: &ldquo;He has joined our side. He helped Tyson escape the portal.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;Thanks, man. We don&rsquo;t know what would happen if you didn&rsquo;t help him.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Derik: &ldquo;It is a small token of my appreciation. It is nothing compared to the moral crimes I have committed in the past.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s past is past.&rdquo; Zelfire said. &ldquo;The important thing is that you changed.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lisa: &ldquo;Yeah. Say, want to become part of our family?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Derik was overwhelmed by their kindness. &ldquo;You&#8230;mean it? Even after all I&rsquo;ve done?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith: &ldquo;A guy who&rsquo;d stand up to his own father to save Tyson doesn&rsquo;t seem like a bad guy at all in my dictionary.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He was almost in tears. &ldquo;Thank you. All of you. For accepting me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>What was left of the building was only the floor. It was like a square arena, and just perfect for their fight. Dust blew away from the floor.</p></p>

<p><p>Vega: &ldquo;Just like old times, eh Tyson? Except this time I will not lose. I will not repeat my mistakes.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Your mistake was messing with my world. You&rsquo;re not gonna get any farther from here, ya hear me?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They jumped up and hit each other like lightning bolts. Their moves were quick as shadows, and their hits were strong as stones.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t ever let you win!&rdquo; the Sayan shouted at the top of his lungs, as he prepared to perform a powerful punch.</p></p>

<p><p>Finally, the showdown is about to come to an end as the sun begins to rise. This dawn will forever change their fate as warriors and as family. Once again, it all comes back to good vs. evil. Can good triumph over evil? Can light overcome the darkness?</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita and Terry stood together to watch the sunrise. This dawn seemed a little different than the others, however. They had just gotten out of the hospital, so their spirit senses were not back to full operation. But they still knew their son was in some kind of danger.</p></p>

<p><p>King Midas had a similar feeling as he sat in the same chair he had been sitting on for the last fifty years. &ldquo;My daughter and my son, please be careful. I want to you see you come back alive.&rdquo; he said in that old shaky voice of his.</p></p>

<p><p>*Bam! Whoosh! Boom!* Their bodies were as fast as shadows, and those shadow figures jumped all over the arena, hitting each other and sometimes moving away. At last, the warriors took a few seconds to rest.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You know you can&rsquo;t win!&rdquo; Vega taunted.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You said that already. Why don&rsquo;t you prove it?&rdquo; Tyson fired back with much confidence in his voice.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My energy lasts forever. Yours will run out eventually. Your frail body cannot compare to mine.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yours may last forever, but mine is a thousand times stronger than yours. That&rsquo;s what counts!&rdquo; He charged.</p></p>

<p><p>Vega shot tentacles at him. This time, his whole arm turned into a bunch of wires, and those wires were stuck together, and they separated when shot out.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget Vega, that love is what defeated you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh? Without Faith you cannot do anything. Since she is not here, you have to fight me alone.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That is all I need to beat you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Your kind is so pathetic. Do you really think that something as unrealistic as love led to your victory?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson grunted. &ldquo;A person like you would never understand. It&rsquo;s sad that you can never feel any real love.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Love and all human emotions are just an illusion! The only thing worth fighting for in life is power.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You still don&rsquo;t understand, do you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand why you and Princess Faith love each other. Look at what you have turned her life into. You are as poor as a rat!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Money doesn&rsquo;t matter! As long as we&rsquo;re happy.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Maybe she was better off with Darian.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson screamed angrily and charged.</p></p>

<p><p>Vega had him just where he wanted him. Tyson punched recklessly, and Vega dodged and slashed, Tyson jumped to the air. Tentacles caught him and dragged him down.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Your energy is mine.&rdquo; ZZZZZZZZZaaaap.</p></p>

<p><p>The Super Sayan screamed in agony as his energy was taken by Vega.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mine! Yes yes! I feel the power! It&rsquo;s what I have been looking for all along.&rdquo; He felt himself stronger than he&rsquo;s ever been in decades. It was the best type of energy he ever drained. His power has always increased in a slow rate, but now he had jumped several levels.</p></p>

<p><p>The tentacles released Tyson and he fell face flat. &ldquo;Uff.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look so down. You win some, you lose some.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson made himself get up, breathing hard and panting. &ldquo;(Huff huff) You will not get away with this. (Huff)&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already gotten away! And there&rsquo;s nobody that can stop me from doing what I want.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson charged wildly and blindly, and Vega blasted him with an energy shard. As he got up, the other heroes came to the scene, watching the fight from a distance. Nebula, Zelfire, Faith, Macintosh, Junior, Derik, Acelot, and Marianna &ndash; every one of them. Worry was on their faces, but so was hope and spirit.</p></p>

<p><p>(Thank you for your support, guys.)</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; Vega taunted, &ldquo;They have come to see you lose. It&rsquo;s your last chance to see them one last time.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No! They came to see me win. They are here for me!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They attacked. Tyson was hit in the face and fell. Lying on the floor, he saw his family. At that moment, he thought what would happen if he lost. What if he lost in front of his family and friends? He&rsquo;d look disgraceful, and if he died, he&rsquo;ll never see them again. He got up and panted.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t ever give up on my planet! Never! Ever!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vega made a strike, not listening to his rubbish. Tyson dodged.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t do it&#8230;then who can?!&rdquo; he screamed at the top of his lungs. Bright, pure white energy overcame his body, mixing with the golden glow. Little lines of light went up and down his body, and he became energized instantly. The look on his face was fiercer than that Vega had ever seen.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, that&rsquo;s my Tyson. You can do it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Derik: (That is the purest energy I have ever felt. It is because he fights for his loved ones. His self-less acts truly are worthy of this power.)</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same power when he fought Prince Mulder. It&rsquo;s like it is happening all over again.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Junior looked worried. &ldquo;Can father win?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Faith said, as if losing was impossible.</p></p>

<p><p>Vega&rsquo;s arms turned to tentacles and tied up Tyson&rsquo;s hands. He broke free as if it was nothing, then used the Power Punch &ndash; Pow! A direct hit on the alien&rsquo;s face. His mask cracked and he was pissed. Vega charged and punched. Tyson grabbed his fist, and the force pushed him backwards. Vega kept moving forward and pushed his enemy. He used his other arm to punch, and Tyson grabbed that too. Now it was a struggle of muscle. They grabbed each other&rsquo;s fingers and pushed with all their might. They grunted and moaned. Electric sparks came out from their energy sphere. The heroes watched in suspense. Even pieces of granite floated around them.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;AAAAARRRRRRGH!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;AAAARRRRRR!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>It was so intense their power caused them to get knocked away. They got up and gathered energy in the form of a ball. Ten seconds passed, and they were ready. Vega fired the biggest beam he could make, and Tyson fired the biggest Wrath Beam he could make. The warriors released the massive energy at the same time. Two gigantic waves crashed into each other, one red, one gold. It became so bright the heroes winced.</p></p>

<p><p>The struggle went, and it could it seemed like either one will win at any second.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;Yaaaaaaaaahhhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vega: &ldquo;Aaaaaaaaaaahhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>*BOOOOM!* Vega was pushed away and he screamed as the golden beam hit him. The ray of gold smashed into the ground far away, creating an explosion that looked like a nuclear explosion.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson fell on his knees, panting for breath. He went back to normal state. &ldquo;I won? I won!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith: &ldquo;You did it!&rdquo; She ran and hugged him.</p></p>

<p><p>All the others gathered around them and celebrated happily.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;I knew you could do it!&rdquo; He slapped his bro on the back.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ow!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oops. Sorry about that.&rdquo; he said, rubbing his head and laughing.</p></p>

<p><p>Everybody laughed.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;Come here, son.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Junior went to his arms and they hugged. Faith was more than glad that they finally got along.</p></p>

<p><p>Derik: &ldquo;You surprise even me. I have learned so much from this experience. I wish father is here to see me now.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Derik, thanks a lot.&rdquo; the Sayan said from the bottom of his heart. &ldquo;Without you I would still be trapped in that scary place. You&rsquo;re not such a bad guy after all. In fact, you can be one of us, if you want.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Derik smiled. No words could express his joy.</p></p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s never too late to change &ndash; for the better. Derik is a great example of how people must know right from wrong, and the ideas their parents gave them are important too, but they do not have to be right. One must use his heart to know right from wrong. Vega and his evil forces are gone, but the earth, in all its chaos, will never be the same again.</p></p>
