<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="a">[ A ] - A Message From the King. Come Home, Princess!</span></p></center>

<p><p>In the <strong>Kingdom of Almerak</strong>, there is a town called <strong>Lodeus</strong>, that which is prosperous and peaceful since the founding of the kingdom. Due to its size, it is considered to be more a city than a town, and it is just as busy as Capital City. It is this very place that Faith and Marianna go visit after their duel with the sorcerer Rubeus. Lodeus has an abundance of small antique shops, and the girls decide to go visit them and have lots of fun.</p></p>

<p><p>After all they&rsquo;ve been through, they deserve to have fun and blow off steam. Faith walked by this store and one of the jars caught her eye, and she stared at it through the display window. Marianna stood next to Faith and they both stared at the jar with smiling faces.</p></p>

<p><p><strong>King Midas</strong> paced back forth in his room, as there is something on his mind. &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; he murmured to himself. &ldquo;What if something happens to her? She&rsquo;s been away from home for too long.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>His servants just watched him with much uneasiness. One of them finally spoke up: &ldquo;Your highness. Please calm down.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How can I be calm? My only daughter is missing!&rdquo; Midas replied.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a strong woman. She can survive on her own.&rdquo; Socrates replied. He is the king&rsquo;s most trusted advisor regarding personal as well as state affairs.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the point!&rdquo; snapped the king. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s naive and inexperienced and she&rsquo;s never been away from home before. Who knows what can happen to her?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>One of the servants came into the room and whispered into another servant&rsquo;s ear. That servant spoke up: &ldquo;Your majesty, maybe some food will ease your mind. The chefs are done making dinner.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How can I eat at a time like this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Socrates: &ldquo;Eating is good for you, your highness. There&rsquo;s no use worrying on an empty stomach.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Midas sighed. &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The dinner table was lined up with food made by the chefs of the palace; the food is of the highest quality, cooked with the best ingredients and the freshest meat. Any regular person, upon seeing the meal, would drool and his eyes would pop out from seeing such a gourmet meal.</p></p>

<p><p>But tonight, the king is not hungry. He tasted the soup. &ldquo;It tastes bad!&rdquo; He smacked the bowl off the table, and it came crashing on the floor. *Crack*</p></p>

<p><p>The servants shivered in fear. None of them dare speak up to him when he is this angry, lest they should be beheaded.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Damn it! Can&rsquo;t you make better soup than this?&rdquo; shouted the king. The truth is, nothing tastes good ever since his daughter, the princess went missing several months ago. His only daughter has run away from home, and Midas is left all alone. Faith is his only heir to the throne, but not only that, she is his only family, the one who reminds him of his late wife.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;All of this is crap!&rdquo; the king shouted, sweeping more food on the floor. Then he placed his palms on the table and panted for breath.</p></p>

<p><p>Just now, the door opened and a man in a white cape walked in. &ldquo;Sire, I heard a noise from down the hallway. What is all this commotion about?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Midas turned around to look at him, and his expression changed. &ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s you, <strong>Squire</strong>.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;At your service.&rdquo; Squire said, placing his hand on his chest and bowing. As the captain of the guards, Squire is a man with grace and dignity, and rumor has it he is a top-notch warrior. He has spiky white hair, bears a white cape on his back, and wears leather pants and boots. He always speaks with elegance, as he is around royalty much of the time. He has deep blue eyes that can pierce into your soul if you look too deeply into it. Amongst the guards, he is feared and respected, due to his appearance and mannerisms, and the way he demands the best out of his subordinates.</p></p>

<p><p>In addition to his regular duties, he is also Princess Faith&rsquo;s bodyguard. He has been assigned this job ever since she was a little girl. She and Squire are of the same age, so Midas worried that they might end up having relations with each other beyond that of princess and bodyguard, but to this day, nothing has happened yet. Squire treats his orders as absolute, and Midas knows that Squire will never betray him.</p></p>

<p><p>Overall, this man with the white hair and white cape is a reliable soldier. That is why Midas&rsquo;s expression changed when he saw his face.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Captain Squire, it&rsquo;s been a while, hasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I have returned from my previous mission, your highness. I have heard rumors that, while I was gone, the princess has gone missing?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; Midas replied. &ldquo;But now that you&rsquo;re back, I can finally take a sigh of relief. I need you your ability, captain. Find my daughter.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Rest assured, your highness. I will find the princess even if I have to flip this kingdom upside down.&rdquo; He bowed, and then he turned around and left the room.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You said what?&rdquo; exclaimed one of the soldiers.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I said I will definitely bring the princess back to her home.&rdquo; Squire replied in the same calm voice he always has.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;B-But...if you fail, the king will have your head, especially after making such a bold claim!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Fear not, for I have a plan.&rdquo; said Squire.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;A plan? I hope it&rsquo;s good.&rdquo; the soldier replied meekly.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We are going to put posters all over town for the missing princess. And we are going to offer a reward for anyone who finds her. The reward will be attractive enough that no commoner can resist it. Five hundred gold pieces will do.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Five hundred gold pieces. That&rsquo;s a drop in the bucket for someone like you, who can ask anything of the king, but I&rsquo;m afraid that alone won&rsquo;t be enough. The kingdom is so big, where will we start? Are we going to search every single town? That will take forever!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Squire walked over to a map on the table. &ldquo;No, not every town. The princess was last seen with her friend over here.&rdquo; He pointed at Sunrise Village. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a village that no longer exists. The closest town to that village is the Town of Lodeus. I am 99% sure that she will be there.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But how do you know she&rsquo;s still there? She&rsquo;s a traveler, so she might have left already.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Squire gave a triumphant smile. &ldquo;I know the princess well. She does not just visit a town and then leave. She wants to explore every bit of it because she likes learning about culture. She will definitely be at Lodeus.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>As per Squire&rsquo;s plan, the infantry went to Lodeus and set up posters with Faith&rsquo;s face on it. It instructed them to contact Squire if they should find anything.</p></p>

<p><p>A man with silver hair and a black cape was kneeling on the ground, panting for breath. His clothes were torn, and his body has scratches all over it. Not only that, but there was blood coming out of the corner of Rubeus&rsquo;s mouth.</p></p>

<p><p>Another man was standing up and he offered his hand. Rubeus looked up at him, and upon seeing a familiar face, took his hand.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Lord Rubeus, are you okay?&rdquo; asked the stranger.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;<strong>Cruton</strong>? What happened?&rdquo; asked the exhausted sorcerer.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You were about to be dragged into the demon portal, my lord. But it&rsquo;s a good thing I got you out in time.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus opened his eyes, and he released the Spirit Beam. Faith fired the Mega Beam, a thick, pink beam of pure energy that destroys anything it touches. The two forces collided...and the Mega Beam, as it&rsquo;s more concentrated, broke through, and hit Rubeus directly, pushing him away. &ldquo;Uuhhhh! Impossible!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus was about to fall into the dark portal, and the demon&rsquo;s hand grabbed him. The portal was closing, and the demon was sinking into the hole, pulling Rubeus down with him. &ldquo;No!!&rdquo; screamed the frantic sorcerer. The demon sunk completely into the darkness, and the portal closed.</p></p>

<p><p> Shortly afterwards, when the forest was empty, Cruton arrived. He chanted the same spell that Rubeus did earlier to open the portal. Cruton saw a bunch of demons, they were all screaming and aching to come to this dimension. But amongst the demon hands, he saw a human&rsquo;s arms, that one has to be Rubeus. He pulled Rubeus&rsquo;s arms until he was out of the portal completely.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So, you saved me. Hmmm. How disgraceful of me to be defeated by a girl like her.&rdquo; Rubeus said, referring to Faith. &ldquo;My death was certain, but you saved me. You have my thanks.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Cruton bowed. &ldquo;Anything for you, my lord. I never forget what you&rsquo;ve done for me. I owe you my life.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>At first glance, Cruton seems like an average and ordinary man, but he is anything but that. He dons a white armor on his upper body that extends to the shoulders, and under that a sleeveless shirt. Like Ren, he has a muscular build, and a valuable henchmen to Lord Rubeus. Unlike the others, however, he has learned sorcery from his master, a rare skill not many can achieve. The fact that he can open the demon portal by himself proves that he is an invaluable tool in Rubeus&rsquo;s army.</p></p>

<p><p>Rumor has it that Rubeus saved Cruton from certain doom when he was a mere child. His master took Cruton in and raised him to be a warrior and a sorcerer, and that is why he owes his life to his master.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus took a few steps forward. &ldquo;We must make preparations for my next plan.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sir, what is our next step?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Right now, Arkady and Ren are in prison. We need to free them.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>While wandering in the Town of Lodeus, Faith and Marianna by chance ran into Prince Darian. Both parties were surprised to see each other, but they greeted each other warmly like old friends.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Prince Darian! What a coincidence.&rdquo; exclaimed Faith.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect to see you again so soon.&rdquo; Marianna was equally as happy to see him as Faith was.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I am just as surprised. What are you doing here in Lodeus?&rdquo; Darian inquired.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We were just checking out the different stores.&rdquo; Faith replied.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I see. By the way, do you mind not calling me Prince Darian? Just Darian is fine.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith playfully put her fist on her head. &ldquo;Oh sorry. I forgot.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. We&rsquo;re both members of royalty. My kingdom doesn&rsquo;t exist, and you don&rsquo;t want to be a princess, so right now we&rsquo;re just normal people.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna piggybacked his comment. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true! We&rsquo;re as normal as we can be. So...are you here to find clues about Vega?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes. But I have no leads. I asked around the town but no one has heard of Vega.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry it isn&rsquo;t going so well.&rdquo; Faith said in sad tone.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright. I kind of expected it to be hard.&rdquo; Darian said, attempting to make himself feel better. But truthfully, on the inside, he had a deep desire for revenge. The sooner he finds Vega, the better, otherwise, the itching will get to him. He had spent countless nights thinking about the night his kingdom burned to ashes. But at least when he&rsquo;s with these two women, he can be at least, and forget about his worries for the time being.</p></p>

<p><p>While the three friends continued their friendly banter, an old woman watched them from afar. She was holding one of the missing posters in her hands. Faith&rsquo;s face matches the face shown in the poster, and the old woman is positive it&rsquo;s the same person.</p></p>

<p><p>Without further ado, she went to see Squire. &ldquo;Are you certain that is the princess?&rdquo; Squire asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes...&rdquo; replied the old lady. &ldquo;It has to be her. My memory is top notch, unrivaled in this town. The princess is staying at this inn that I run. She will be there for a while.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Excellent.&rdquo; said Squire. He snapped his fingers and one of the soldiers hands the old woman a bag of coins.</p></p>

<p><p>She opened the bag to find 500 gold coins, the promised reward amount. Her eyes grew wide open as they reflected the shine of the gold. The old woman has never seen this much money in her life, and now she is all set. &ldquo;Thank you, my lord!&rdquo; She shoved the bag of coins into her pocket and left the room.</p></p>

<p><p>With their new companion, Faith, Marianna, and Darian walked down the street, heading towards the inn they were staying at for the time being. However, something caught Marianna&rsquo;s eye - a poster on the wall. &ldquo;Faith, doesn&rsquo;t that picture look you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darian ripped one of them off to get a closer look. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look like you, <strong>it is you!</strong>&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith grabbed the poster from Darian&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;It <strong>IS</strong> me! Princess is missing...a handsome reward will be given to anyone who knows the princess&rsquo;s whereabouts? It must be my father&rsquo;s doing!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But...how does he know you&rsquo;re in Lodeus?&rdquo; Marianna asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He probably used his spies to trail me here.&rdquo; Faith responded. She crushed the poster. &ldquo;How could he do this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Because your father misses you.&rdquo; said Squire. His voice attracted everyone&rsquo;s attention. Then two soldiers appeared, one on his left and the other on his right.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Squire?&rdquo; said Faith, her eyes dilating. &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I came here to bring you home, princess.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You know him?&rdquo; Darian asked the obvious because she did not want to be left out.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith spoke without taking her eyes off Squire. &ldquo;He is Squire, a captain who&rsquo;s assigned to be my bodyguard. My father must have sent you. Tell him I am not going back.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Squire frowned. &ldquo;You must not make your father worry, princess. Stop being so stubborn and come back home.&rdquo; He spoke in a frank manner and did not want to waste any time, and this upset Darian.</p></p>

<p><p>Darian stood in front of her. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear what she said? She has no desire to go home. She does not want to be trapped like some bird in a cage.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me, but who are you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m her friend.&rdquo; Darian responded.</p></p>

<p><p>To Squire, it makes no different, an obstacle is an obstacle. &ldquo;A commoner, eh? This is none of your business. Move.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This <strong>is</strong> my business.&rdquo; Ignoring the fact that Squire is wrong about him being a commoner, as he is a prince of a fallen kingdom, he does not like this guy&rsquo;s attitude. Squire&rsquo;s appearance is for sure unique, with white hair, blue eyes, and a long white cape. But there is a certain strength about him that goes beyond appearance. Darian, being a warrior himself, can sense Squire&rsquo;s fighting spirit, and feels that he&rsquo;s a threat.</p></p>

<p><p><strong>The feeling is mutual</strong>, as Squire feels that Darian is more than some mere commoner. &ldquo;Do not make me say it twice. Affairs within the royal family is none of your concern, outsider. If you do not move, I cannot be responsible for what happens to you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>That last remark was all that Darian needed to hear. He put his hand on the butt of his sword.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith grabbed his hand. &ldquo;No.&rdquo; She stepped forward, extending her right arm horizontally. &ldquo;There will be no fighting in my presence.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;As you wish, princess.&rdquo; Squire responded. Even though she is not speaking as a princess, he still has the habit of obeying her orders. As far as he is concerned, one&rsquo;s duty must be followed no matter what the situation is.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I will go back with you.&rdquo; Faith declared, much to the displeasure of her friends.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo; Marianna exclaimed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give in to him!&rdquo; Darian shouted. He was more aggravated than Marianna, due to his dislike of Squire. Even though Faith and her bodyguard have a history, Darian has never seen this man before. To him, Squire is nothing more than a lapdog of the military trying to take his friend away.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith turned around and grabbed Marianna&rsquo;s hand and Darian&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to cause trouble for anybody. I have made up my mind to go back home.&rdquo; She walked over to Squire&rsquo;s side.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna&rsquo;s hand reached out to Faith. &ldquo;But...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Looks like our vacation got cut short. Don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ll do this again another time, Marianna. Right now, I have my duties to attend to. I cannot run away from my responsibilities anymore.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Excellent choice, princess. The king will be most pleased you&rsquo;ve come to your senses.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darian clenched his fist. If Faith goes with Squire, that means Squire has won. This little encounter has become personal for him. Him and Marianna just watched Faith go reluctantly, feeling helpless as their friend was just taken from them.</p></p>

<p><p>As part of Rubeus&rsquo;s plan, he goes to pay a little visit to Arkady, who was in prison for his crimes. Arkady was sitting down in the way, being angry at how helpless he is, and suddenly, there&rsquo;s an explosion that causes the wall the collapse. To his surprise, it&rsquo;s Rubeus.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Time to get to work, Arkady.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, my lord. My apologies for failing you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus turned around to face the outdoors. &ldquo;I have no time for excuses. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>As this was happening, Cruton went to free Ren from another prison. In addition to his sorcery, Cruton is also a fighter. So breaking into a prison and beating up some guards is but a small task for someone like him.</p></p>

<p><p>Now, Rubeus stood before his three henchmen, who are lined up single file. &ldquo;Now that you are all here, I can finally begin the next phase of my plan. It was going well until that wench showed up and ruined everything.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our fault that we&rsquo;re too weak to defeat them.&rdquo; said Ren, clenching a fist and looking down.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus then replied: &ldquo;It <strong>is</strong> your fault, and I will decide a suitable punishment for you later. But right now, I have something I need to do.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What is it, sire?&rdquo; Cruton inquired.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The princess will pay for what she&rsquo;s done. But revenge will come in due time. I must meditate for seven days to raise my ki. Make sure that during this time I am not to be disturbed.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>All his henchmen bowed in acknowledgement.</p></p>

<p><p>Thus, Rubeus locked himself in his room to meditate. After his previous fight with Princess Faith, his ki has been drained, and he needs seven days to recover back to his full strength.</p></p>

<p><p>The room is completely dark except for one lit candle, which burned out eventually. Light is not necessary for his meditation. He sat down cross legged, hands on his knees, eyes closed, and his ki caused him to float above the ground. His body emitted a purple ki, a spiritual energy so strong that even a common man without the sixth sense can feel it. All the ki was contained within the room, if not, then his henchmen would have felt it and panicked.</p></p>

<p><p>Meanwhile, Rubeus&rsquo;s henchmen were training during this seven day period. They wanted to sharpen their skills so as to not disappoint their master like they did in the previous battle.</p></p>


<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="b">[ B ] - Rubeus is Still Alive? His New Diabolical Plan</span></p></center>


<p><p>Squire brought Faith back home. Midas, upon seeing his daughter, was overjoyed. &ldquo;Faith!&rdquo; He ran towards her and embraced her.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith, however, did not return the embrace. &ldquo;I am home, father.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Midas let her go. &ldquo;I have prayed to the heavens that nothing would happen to you while you were away.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Really? Were you really worried about me, or just worried that you will not have a heir?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Non-sense. You&rsquo;re my only daughter. Your safety is all that I care about.&rdquo; Then he looked at Squire. &ldquo;I knew I could count on you to do the job. I will make sure you will be handsomely rewarded.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Squire bowed. &ldquo;Your kindness is second to none, your highness.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Midas waved his arm as he gives his orders. &ldquo;You must be tired. Take Faith to her room.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Squire did as he is told. &ldquo;Come, princess, this way.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Squire took Faith back to her bedroom. &ldquo;Please do not leave this room, princess.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith walked over to the window and did not look at Squire. &ldquo;Did my father tell you to keep me in here? Let me guess, I cannot leave without his permission?&rdquo; She was rather upset, and it showed in her tone of voice.</p></p>

<p><p>Squire, however, remained calm as he always is. &ldquo;He cares for your safety.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It figures. He wants to keep me here like a prisoner again.&rdquo; said Faith. She&rsquo;s known her father her whole life, so she knows how he thinks. Midas has tried to control her many times before, and this time, it is no different.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He only wants what&rsquo;s best for you.&rdquo; Squire, however, viewed this situation from a different perspective. Unlike Faith, he has no emotional attachments to this situation, rather, he is just doing his job.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He does not know what&rsquo;s best for me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ever since Prince Acelot ran away, you became his only child. It&rsquo;s only natural he is worried about you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Upon hearing her brother&rsquo;s name, Faith turned around with an <strong>angry glare</strong>. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say my brother&rsquo;s name like you know anything. I&rsquo;m tired and I wish to be left alone.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Squire was quite startled. This was the first time he felt this way since Lodeus. Maybe he opened a can of worms. &ldquo;As you wish.&rdquo; He closed the door behind him.</p></p>

<p><p>On the seventh day, Rubeus finally came out of his room. His henchmen can feel his ki, as it is much stronger than it was before his meditation. Arkady, Ren, and Cruton were shocked to feel this <strong>new power</strong> emanating from Rubeus, and it is as if he is a completely different person than before, and they eagerly awaited their master&rsquo;s orders.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I have finished my seven day meditation.&rdquo; Rubeus announced. &ldquo;Now...for the next phase in my plan. We are going to take over the imperial palace.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady and Ren were shocked. &ldquo;What? But master...that means you&rsquo;re waging war against the imperial army?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Cruton started snickering and then laughing out loud. &ldquo;You never cease to surprise me, my lord. So your ambition has grown so big that you want to control the kingdom, eh?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is no simple task.&rdquo; said Ren.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The purpose of this attack is two-fold. I have determined that the imperial palace has a lot of spiritual energy. Many people must have been killed there in the past, resulting in this influx of spiritual energy. It&rsquo;s the perfect place to open a portal to the demon world. With your abilities, taking out a few guards here and there should be no problem.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>All three henchmen bowed.</p></p>

<p><p>At the front gate of the royal palace, two guards stand by on each side of the gate. All people coming in and out of the palace must go through them first. Tonight is a quiet, uneventful night as usual, and the guard on the right yawned.</p></p>

<p><p>The left guard said: &ldquo;Hey, did you hear something?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hear what?&rdquo; replied the right guard during his post-yawn voice.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I definitely heard something.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Relax, man. Nothing ever happens here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, an arrow flew out of the bushes and hit the right guard. The left guard pointed his spear forward. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>An arrow hit him in the head, and died before he even fell down.</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady came out of the bushes, and behind him were Ren, Cruton, and last but not least, Rubeus.</p></p>

<p><p>Ren pounded his fist. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of this door.&rdquo; He used the Power Wave and shattered the wooden gates into pieces.</p></p>

<p><p>Once the gate was destroyed, someone blew a horn and all soldiers in the palace became alert. The four villains stood there in the open, not even worried one bit.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Take care of these soldiers.&rdquo; Rubeus commanded. &ldquo;Kill them if you must.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>An archer from the tower shot an arrow at Ren, who blasted the arrow into dust with a beam. Arkady shot an arrow and hit the archer in the chest, killing him on the spot. Then he aimed at the second tower and shot an arrow, hitting the archer, causing him to fall down the tower, plunging to his death.</p></p>

<p><p>An entire battalion of soldiers arrived, all holding spears and swords. Ren pounded his fist. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get it on!&rdquo; He charged into the group of enemies without even a shred of doubt, and started pounding away. He used the Power Fist and knocked soldiers all over the place.</p></p>

<p><p>A group of soldiers pointed their spears at Cruton, who remained calm with his eyes closed. Once his eyes opened, he released an energy wave that knocked everyone away. *Wham*</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady loaded three arrows into his bow and fired them, hitting three soldiers. They fell on the floor, bleeding in agony. Ren used the Power Wave, destroying the ground, and blew them all away.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aaaaah!!&rdquo; The screams of the dying soldiers were heard and it&rsquo;s just music to Rubeus&rsquo;s ears.</p></p>

<p><p>He has personally trained his henchmen, so he trusts their abilities, and they can handle regular people with no ease. Not even an army can handle his henchmen.</p></p>

<p><p>A guard came into the room and whispered into Squire&rsquo;s ear. Squire&rsquo;s eyes widened. &ldquo;Sire, it seems that we have some trouble.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Is something the matter?&rdquo; inquired Midas.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It is nothing.&rdquo; said Squire, trying not to let the king worry. &ldquo;Some sorcerers have broken into the palace. It&rsquo;s a foolish move on their part. I will take care of this. You guys, protect his highness.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The remaining guards saluted and responded: &ldquo;Yes sir!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Midas&rsquo;s eyebrows narrowed. &ldquo;A sorcerer. Could it be...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The guards take Midas into the royal hall, the safest room in the entire palace. Two guards closed the door, the only way into the royal hall. Then one of the guards said: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry your highness, we will protect you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Squire entered the ground floor, a room that has a golden statue of a man on a horse. Supposedly, the man on the horse was a hero whose accomplishments had a great impact in Almerak&rsquo;s history. Staring at the golden statue, Squire often daydreamed that he can, one day, become a hero who will accomplish great things.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, a guard came into the room. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re...they&rsquo;re here.&rdquo; He fell down face flat, revealing an arrow stuck in his back.</p></p>

<p><p>Squire was shocked that someone just died in front of him. &ldquo;Just what is going on here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady appeared, and he leaned against the doorway with his arms crossed, and Ren leaned against the wall. Cruton came into the room and stepped to the side, so that Rubeus can walk through the center.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re responsible for this? Who are you?&rdquo; Squire demanded.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How rude.&rdquo; Arkady replied. &ldquo;Is this any way to ask of our master&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Everyone must kneel before the might of Lord Rubeus.&rdquo; Ren added.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Rubeus?&rdquo; Squire repeated.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard of me?&rdquo; asked a curious Rubeus.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. The king told me about a petty thief who happens to know sorcery, and he causes trouble all over the kingdom, but never gets caught.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a sorcerer, but hardly a petty thief. My ambitions are much, much bigger than that.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmph. So you decided to raid the palace and assassinate the king? Not on my watch!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ren stepped forward. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just another one of the king&rsquo;s goons. I&rsquo;ll end this quickly.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Squire smiled. &ldquo;Go ahead and try.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus, however, sees what&rsquo;s beyond Squire&rsquo;s unwavering confidence. His confidence is different than Ren&rsquo;s arrogance, however. There is something about Squire that is much more than meets the eye, and Rubeus is curious about his abilities.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Here goes!&rdquo; Ren charged forward and let out a fury of punches. Squire dodged them all like they were nothing. He has done this in training many times, so a simple thing like a one dimensional punch will not work. *Whoosh whoosh*</p></p>

<p><p>Ren used the Power Fist, hitting Squire in the chest. *Thud* Squire was caught by surprise at the fist&rsquo;s speed and strength, and he stuttered backwards, his feet scraping the floor. Ren smirked at his own victory.</p></p>

<p><p>Squire then looked up and smiled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your move?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Then Ren became annoyed. &ldquo;That was just a warm up.&rdquo; He powered up.</p></p>

<p><p>Squire unsheathed his sword. *Schling* &ldquo;I was hoping you&rsquo;d say that.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ren threw an energy ball at him. Squire swings his sword and knocked it away like a baseball, and it hit the wall and exploded. *Bam*</p></p>

<p><p>Ren, in his haste, threw more energy balls forward. Squire knocked them all away, as quickly as they came. Ren threw more balls, hoping one of them will hit his target. But his efforts were in vain, as the white caped warrior knocked every single ball away.</p></p>

<p><p>Tired from the ordeal, Ren panted for breath.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Are you done, or should I come attack you now?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ren grunted angrily, and he used the Power Wave. He punched the ground, causing a shockwave to appear. Squire swings his sword vertically, creating a windbreaker that cut the Power Wave in half. *Froom* Ren was shocked his move did not work, and did not have enough time to react. *Slish!* The windbreaker from the sword cut Ren, causing him to fall.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh! Ughhh!&rdquo; cried Ren, grabbing his wound. Arkady came to his aid.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ohh, not bad.&rdquo; Rubeus complimented. &ldquo;Not many fighters can defeat Ren.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady stepped forward. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s mine.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus extended his arm, signally Arkady to stop. &ldquo;No. I will take him on myself.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, my lord.&rdquo; Arkady replied, and promptly stepped back.</p></p>

<p><p>Squire said: &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re going to fight me one at a time?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s best you don&rsquo;t underestimate me, captain.&rdquo; said Rubeus.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to pay for your crimes, sorcerer!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus extended his arms to the side as he raised his ki. His body emitted a white aura and his ki changed all the wind currents around him. Everyone in the room felt it, especially Squire, the one who has to fight him. Cruton and Arkady are just glad that they are not his opponent.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What power!&rdquo; Squire exclaimed, covering his eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never felt anything like this before!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The sorcerer levitated until he was ten feet above the ground. With his glowing white aura, he seemed more like a god than a sorcerer. &ldquo;So, how will you hit me if I&rsquo;m up here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He gathered some energy balls and threw it down. Squire back flipped away to safety, the balls hit the ground and exploded. *Kaboom*</p></p>

<p><p>Squire threw his sword at Rubeus, which bounced off him. &ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus threw more energy balls, and Squire back flipped away. But he was close to the golden statue, with nowhere to run. Since he cannot run, there is only one thing to do: fight head on with the enemy. Squire gathered ki to charge up a beam. Rubeus did the same; charging up his ki for a final attack.</p></p>

<p><p>Once they were both finished, Squire fired first, and Rubeus second. The two beams hit each other at the midpoint between the two fighters. *Froom* Their powers were even and the beams were unable to push each other. At the collision point, there was so much energy that any person standing there would be vaporized instantly.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Rubeus used a new trick that he learned. His eyes glowed a ghastly white color, a white that is much brighter than Squire&rsquo;s hair. As a result, Squire found himself unable to move. (What!? My body isn&rsquo;t responding!)</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus&rsquo;s purple beam pushed Squire&rsquo;s white beam further down until it hit Squire, knocking him against the golden statue. *Wham*</p></p>

<p><p>That was a critical hit, one that even Squire cannot recover from. He crawled forward a little, but he cannot stand on his feet anymore. Not even having the time to figure out why his body won&rsquo;t move at that crucial time, he groaned in pain, as he suffered a humiliating defeat, and fell unconscious on the concrete.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;There.&rdquo; said Rubeus. &ldquo;Now only minor obstacles remain.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ren stood up, limping. &ldquo;My lord, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;<strong>Enough with the excuses</strong>.&rdquo; Rubeus scolded. &ldquo;But the blame does not fall entirely on you. This man&rsquo;s skills are exceptional.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady awaited his orders eagerly. &ldquo;What do we do now?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ren, you go and wipe out the soldiers on the south gate. Arkady, go to the east gate and do the same, and Cruton, you&rsquo;re in charge of the west gate. Now go.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes master!&rdquo; they said in unison, and they left to do their jobs.</p></p>

<p><p>For Rubeus, victory is within his grasp, for there is one more thing he must do.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I need to know what is happening out there.&rdquo; said Midas.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please, your highness, leave it to Squire.&rdquo; replied the guard. &ldquo;He is a capable man and he&rsquo;ll handle it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Still.&rdquo; said Midas. &ldquo;I cannot be at ease until I know what is happening.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We are but guards, sire, here to protect you. Your safety is our priority. So please do not leave the premises.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Midas sat down and sighed in pain. He put his hand on his forehead. He found it difficult to do nothing in this situation, where there is battle going on outside. Who would dare raid the imperial palace? Someone who wants to control the land? If it is an independent army, then Squire can handle them with no worries. But if the offender were a sorcerer like Rubeus, the one he&rsquo;s heard about in rumors, then not even Squire can defeat him.</p></p>

<p><p>What bad timing this is. His daughter has finally come home, and he wanted to spend some quality time together, but now the palace is under siege. Midas was more worried about Faith than his own well being.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, the door broke down, causing the guards to draw their spears. Rubeus&rsquo;s eyes darted left and right, counting his opponents. The guards charged at him, and Rubeus&rsquo;s eyes glowed, causing them to freeze in place. Then he waved his arm, knocking them away.</p></p>

<p><p>In an instant, all the guards were on the floor and rendered useless.</p></p>

<p><p>Midas walked closer to enemy. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re the rumored sorcerer, Rubeus.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You know me? I am honored, your highness.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The fact that you&rsquo;re here means Squire was defeated.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, the captain of the guards? A mere mortal cannot defeat me. Now, King Midas, why don&rsquo;t you surrender?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Me, surrender? Never! Not without a fight.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmph. So you want to do this the hard way?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Midas got into attack stance and gathered energy. Rubeus was surprised that this old man is actually a fighter, he certainly does not look like one. When he was done powering up, Midas charged forward and screamed &ldquo;Tiger Fist!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus blocked the incoming fist, but he was pushed back a few feet. Midas was shocked that his technique failed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Not bad, for an old man.&rdquo; Rubeus squeezed the king&rsquo;s fist, to which Midas grunted in pain. The sorcerer then struck Midas&rsquo;s chest with his palm. *Thud*</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;R1_A&quot;></a></p></p>

<p><p>Midas was pushed back a few feet and he grabbed his wound. Rubeus finished him with a blast of wind, knocking the old man on the ground.</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="c">[ C ] - Take Over the Kingdom</span></p></center>

<p><p>The king coughed from his injuries. Although he was once a fighter, his body is way past his prime. Rubeus walked over to him, so that Midas stared at his feet.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now, your highness, what do you say now?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Midas crawled back up on his palms, but he was still unable to stand up. &ldquo;Go to hell!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Is that how you speak to someone who can kill you in an instant? How about you kneel before me?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Midas almost laughed. &ldquo;Me, kneel? I am the King of Almerak...only others kneel before me. Yet you, a mere sorcerer, are asking me to kneel? In your dreams!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Such a stubborn old man you are. I&rsquo;ve heard that you have a beautiful daughter. What was her name? Faith?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Damn you Rubeus, if you dare touch her...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus grabbed Midas by the collar and they looked each other in the eyes. &ldquo;Good, we have a deal then. You obey me from now on and I will not hurt her.&rdquo; Then he kneed him in the chest, causing Midas to fall on his knees and cough.</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;TrappedCastle&quot;></a>Trapped in the Castle</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was standing by the window, staring outside into the darkness of the night. There was a lot on her mind and she did not pay attention to anything else. She did not notice that an intruder is about to come into her room.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus pushed the door and went into the bedroom. As he expected, the princess was here, standing by the window with her back facing him. Tonight, she appeared to be more attractive, a little more than usual to Rubeus. She was wearing the same pink outfit she usually wears - the pink blouse with long sleeves, and the pink mini-skirt which revealed most of her legs. And of course he noticed the pony tail on her head, her only hairstyle.</p></p>

<p><p>Her aura seemed a little different than usual. Maybe it&rsquo;s because she&rsquo;s not holding a sword, or maybe it&rsquo;s because she&rsquo;s back in her palace, in her bedroom - whatever the reason is - tonight she seems more womanly, there was a feminine charm about her.</p></p>

<p><p>Upon hearing footsteps, Faith turned around. She gasped in surprise, seeing her number one enemy in the room. What is Rubeus doing here, of all places?!</p></p>

<p><p>It was too shocking and surreal so it took a few seconds for the reality of the situation to register in her mind.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;R-Rubeus? What are you doing here?&rdquo; Faith moved away from the wall to a distance away from him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So this is your home, eh? How fancy. As expected, nothing less from the royal family.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What happened to the guards?&rdquo; she inquired.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The guards?&rdquo; Rubeus burst into laughter. &ldquo;Those peons aren&rsquo;t even worth a minute of my time. The security in your castle is...lacking.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith got into fighting position, always alert every second. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh. My forces have already taken over the castle. This place now belongs to me.&rdquo;<br>  Faith was surprised. &ldquo;No! This is my home! It does not belong to you! It never will!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus snickered at her denial. &ldquo;The king has already surrendered. I suggest you do the same.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Father...&rdquo; Then Faith stared at him with a grimace. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never get your way.&rdquo; She charged at him and unleashed a series of punches. Rubeus dodged by tilting his head left and right. *Whoosh whoosh* Faith kept aiming for his head, but he dodged as fast as she could throw punches.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus jumped away from her to keep the distance. He gathered energy into his palm and fired a purple beam. Faith crossed her arms over her face to block it. *Bam* The force of the beam pushed her back. Smoke was coming out of her arms from the energy.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus fired another purple beam, Faith jumped up to avoid it. While in the air, she descended forward, performing a flying kick. Rubeus clasped his palms together and forced a white bubble that surrounded his body. Faith&rsquo;s foot hit Rubeus&rsquo;s shield, and bounced off. She landed in a crouch.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Always the rebellious one, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is my home, and you&rsquo;re not welcome here!&rdquo; Faith extended her arms forward, putting her palms together, and gathered energy into the shape of a pink ball. She was about to unleash a fierce attack, but Rubeus was not about to let her. His eyes glowed a bright white color - it was so bright that it&rsquo;s blinding.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, the ball in her palms disappeared, and she realized she cannot move.</p></p>

<p><p>(My body...it&rsquo;s not responding! What&rsquo;s going on?)</p></p>

<p><p>Faith tried to move with all her might, but it was no use. Unable to use her body, she&rsquo;s now a sitting duck.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus released some energy and fired a beam, knocking her against the wall. *Wham!*</p></p>

<p><p>Pieces of her clothing were blown off as she took the full force of the attack, and once she hit the wall, she fell down.</p></p>

<p><p>She was nearly unconscious from that fatal blow, and it was painful for Faith to even move. She grunted heavily, while getting back on her palms and knees. Then she planted her feet on the floor, one at a time, and stood up on her feet. Faith was hunched over, her right arm holding onto her left elbow. She was panting for breath this whole time.</p></p>

<p><p>Her skirt had a rip on her thigh, and her blouse had a rip on the right side of the stomach, and there was a hole on her right shoulder, revealing part of her bra.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus liked what he saw, and he wanted to see more. For him, this is not even a fight, it is a form of entertainment. Stripping this woman will be like taking candy from a baby.</p></p>

<p><p>She panted for breath, while staring at him like a wounded animal. Faith was still in shock from not being able to move during a critical time. She had no idea what happened, maybe it&rsquo;s one of Rubeus&rsquo;s new abilities?</p></p>

<p><p>There was no time to think and analyze...Rubeus opened his right palm and fired a beam.</p></p>

<p><p>*Bam* Faith tried to block it, but she was too weak from the previous attack, and the beam overpowered her.</p></p>

<p><p>Pieces of her clothes were ripped to shreds, and her back hit the wall. The pain was intense and her eyes were wide open and she screamed out loud. &ldquo;Ugh!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She fell on her knees, then fell completely on her face.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus knows that this battle belongs to him. &ldquo;Hmmm. Where were we? Oh yes, I believe I said that I am now the new owner of the Imperial Palace.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Poor Faith was too injured to even stand up. She crawled away from him, but she was as slow as a snail and didn&rsquo;t get far.</p></p>

<p><p>Even though he has already won, Rubeus wanted to go even further. He was still upset about being defeated during their last encounter - to be defeated by a little girl like her is very humiliating. But seeing Faith suffer like this, seeing how helpless she is, makes it seem silly that this girl was the one who ruined his plans. But this is not about revenge anymore...tonight he is going to satisfy his lust.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus gathered bunch of energy balls in front of him. He threw them in her direction. The balls hit her body one by one at rapid speed, and she screamed in pain. Unable to dodge, she was nothing more than a lamb waiting to be slaughtered. More of her clothes were destroyed from the blasts, and she screamed in agony. &ldquo;Aaah! Aaaahh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The poor girl continued to suffer, while her enemy showed no mercy. Her fingers grabbed the floor and she writhed in pain. She had never felt such physical torment before, and became nearly unconscious. Rubeus just watched while laughing maniacally. Although it was fatal attack, it was not life-threatening.</p></p>

<p><p>Most of her clothes were destroyed. All that&rsquo;s left was her bra and a torn skirt. Pieces of her blouse were still on her arms and shoulders, but at this point, it was not a blouse anymore, but shreds of fabric.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus walked towards her. &ldquo;Your skin is showing, princess.&rdquo; he taunted.</p></p>

<p><p>The sorcerer used his telekinesis and lifted her body up. Faith felt as if her body was being pulled by an invisible force, and she had no control over herself whatsoever. It was as if she was being lifted by invisible strings.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Come here.&rdquo; Rubeus made her body levitate towards him, with her back facing him. Once she came in contact, Rubeus grabbed her breasts and smelled her hair. Rubeus thought she smelled good.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Agh! Ugh!&rdquo; She groaned as he fondled her breasts.</p></p>

<p><p> Faith squirmed and writhed as she was being violated from behind. Rubeus was enjoying himself, stroking her breasts and smelling her hair, and he was getting aroused.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith managed to shove him away. He grabbed her arms, pulled her into him and kissed her lips. They tasted so good, he nearly swallowed her lips. He wanted to do this ever since he first saw her by the window.</p></p>

<p><p>When Rubeus was done with her, he shoved her on the floor. *Thud* Then he levitated her up to the air. She was floating horizontally and her arms were spread out to the side. In this position, she was completely helpless.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus walked towards her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Put me down, please!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo; He was leering at her body. Rubeus thought that this is a good look for Faith - her clothes all torn up, and her body&rsquo;s all roughed up - and she can&rsquo;t do anything to resist as she&rsquo;s floating in mid-air.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please...don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He touched her thigh and felt her skin with his hand. He&rsquo;d never though that her skin would feel so good against his, her thighs were so soft and touchable. He moved his hand to her knee and then her shin. As he glided his hand down to her ankle, he took off her shoe and tossed it away. Then he took off the other shoe.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No. No! Stop!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus grew more excited as he was about to strip her bare. For him, it was like unwrapping a present at Christmas.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No! Stop!!&rdquo; Faith cried out.</p></p>

<p><p>Her pleas were like music to his ears. Being a villain his whole life, Rubeus likes to be in control and dominate other people. And now he is in complete control of the situation, this woman&rsquo;s life is in his hands. And he&rsquo;s loving every moment of it. There is nothing like stripping a woman while she&rsquo;s crying out for help - and to him this is the best feeling ever.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus ripped off whatever was left of her blouse. Trrrrrr. The sound of tearing fabric. Faith shrieked as her blouse was ripped to shreds. Now only a bra was covering her breasts.</p></p>

<p><p>He put his fingers under the middle of the bra, and Faith grew nervous. &ldquo;No, please!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He tugged real hard, and the whole thing came off.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aaaaaaah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus put it on his face and smelled it, and he sighed. The bra had Faith&rsquo;s scent on it. He threw it away and proceeded to his next task.</p></p>

<p><p>He put his hand on her thigh and went into her pink skirt. &ldquo;I wonder what&rsquo;s in here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith moaned. &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>His hand rummaged in there, causing Faith to moan even louder, and then he put both hands into her skirt and pulled out her panties. They were a dark purple color.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please, no!!&rdquo; she cried as he pulled the thin piece of fabric down her legs.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus laughed as he pulled her panties down. He pulled it down to her feet and out it came. He sniffed them and sighed. Then he tossed them away.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;And all that&rsquo;s left is this.&rdquo; he said, looking at the torn up skirt.</p></p>

<p><p>He pulled it and it came off in one tear.</p></p>

<p><p>Now Faith was completely naked, floating in mid air. Tears streamed down her face. So this is what she looks like naked, he thought.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus then opened his palm, causing her to spin in the air horizontally. She was flipping away from him and hit the wall on her front. Then she fell down. Splat.</p></p>

<p><p>She was naked, her ass was showing. So this is what she looks like from behind.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith crawled away, very slowly. Rubeus watched curiously. She crawled towards the bra.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus then sat down and made the bra move away from her. She almost grabbed it, but he moved it a few inches away. She crawled some more.</p></p>

<p><p>Then he got bored of playing with her. He walked over to her and grabbed her by the hair.</p></p>

<p><p>Then he made the panties fly to his hand, and shoved it in her mouth. &ldquo;Mmmfff&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Then he lied down on top of her, and did whatever he felt like.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna and Darian were sitting in a bar, drinking and drowning their sorrows away. Things have gotten quiet and awkward since Faith left them.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just not the same.&rdquo; Marianna blurted out, after downing a whole cup of beer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more fun when she&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; replied Darian. &ldquo;I cannot believe she left you just like that. It&rsquo;s so sudden.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We were supposed to go on a trip together. Just the two of us. But now look at what happened.&rdquo; She hiccupped.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That Squire fellow did not leave us much of a choice. I don&rsquo;t trust him.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;He&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; Marianna said, resting her head on her arms. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s Faith&rsquo;s bodyguard. He&rsquo;s been protecting her since childhood.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something about him that I do not like. I&rsquo;m not sure what.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Marianna banged her fist on the table. &ldquo;I cannot accept this. Faith is <strong>my</strong> friend. I have to get her back, even if the king disagrees with me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>At first, Darian was taken aback by her brash words, but then he smiled. &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re right. Listen, I have something to take care of. You going to be okay by yourself?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m perfectly fine. I&rsquo;m the best archer in the kingdom, remember?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;R2_PurpleRibbons1&quot;></a>Purple Ribbons - Part 1</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus leered at his prisoner, who was bound to the bed post, her wrists tied up behind her by a purple ribbon. He glanced at her figure, starting from the bottom to the top, and every part of her was attractive. Faith was wearing virtually nothing, except for purple ribbons wrapped around her body like bandages, from her breasts down to her hips. Everything but her private parts were covered.</p></p>

<p><p>Her legs were completely exposed from the hips down, and Rubeus admired her legs. Her thighs are shapely and thin, and her skin is smooth and flawless. And her breasts are round and firm, and he can see how big they are even though the ribbons covered most of them. And the skin on her arms are smooth as silk, and her shoulders are round and small, and he likes her curves. She was staring at the floor, panting for breath.</p></p>

<p><p>This look is a good look for her, he thought. Under the ribbons, there is nothing - this is almost the same as being naked, but not quite. Leaving her standing there naked would be too crude. This is his castle now, and he does not want to turn it into a slut house. Now that Rubeus controls her fate, he controls whatever she wears, including how much, or how little she wears.</p></p>

<p><p>Even if it&rsquo;s too harsh for this poor girl, Rubeus considers this an act of generosity, as he&rsquo;s allowing her to wear something. Anything is better than being stark naked.</p></p>

<p><p>Indeed, this is the perfect look for his prisoner. While Faith is wearing this, it&rsquo;s inconvenient for her to fight back or try to escape. Rubeus sees her body as a work of art, to be admired by the eyes...and by other parts of the body. With these ribbons, he can strip her easier. He likes having control, and this shows that he the dominant one in the room and she is his slave.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was panting for breath and sweating a little bit. It is unknown why she is tired, but perhaps it has something to do with the torturing from earlier?</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus walked over to her and Faith stared at him with frightened eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;W-What do you want?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He grabbed her chin. &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; Then he leaned in and kissed her lips.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;MMMMFFF!&rdquo; She resisted, but there wasn&rsquo;t much she could do, and Rubeus sucked on her lips as if a lover would, tasting them fully.</p></p>

<p><p>When he was finally done, she turned to the side to avoid looking at him. Rubeus thought that she looks cute when she does that.</p></p>

<p><p>He put his hand on her right breast and fondled it, causing her to groan in pain. &ldquo;Your breasts are so soft to touch. Mmmm.&rdquo; he whispered into her ear.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ughhh...uhhh...&rdquo; Faith winced and groaned. She desperately struggled to untie her hands, wanting to get out of this situation. But it&rsquo;s difficult to concentrate while she&rsquo;s being violated from the front.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus tantalizingly glided his hand down to her stomach, and then her hip. &ldquo;I wonder what&rsquo;s down here.&rdquo; He touched her thigh all over, and moved his hand between her legs into the ribbons.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith groaned in pain. &ldquo;Ugh! Uhhh!&rdquo; Her wrists thrashed about, trying to pull the ribbon loose, while she squirmed from Rubeus&rsquo;s frontal assault. He did not hold back at all, shoving his hand down there all the way, causing her to feel extreme discomfort and pain. &ldquo;Uhhhhh!!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, the cloth tying her wrists were loose, and her hands were free, and she shoved him away. She ran towards the wall, and then turned around to face her predator.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Where do you think you&rsquo;re going?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>With her back against the wall, she realized that the only way out is to fight. Faith braced herself and put her arms up and fists curled.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus leered at her body. &ldquo;Ohhh. You&rsquo;re going to fight wearing that?&rdquo; He did not feel threatened at all but rather, entertained by the idea that she will still resist him in her current state.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith charged at him and punched, he dodged to the side. She punched with the other arm, and he dodged by side stepping. Then he grabbed the ribbon on her body and pulled it, causing her to spin away. <br>  &ldquo;Aaahh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Then he pulled the ribbon, making her walk towards him. He grabbed her and kissed her lips. She shoved him away.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What is the point of fighting now? You&rsquo;re my prisoner and you have no chance to escape.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let you have your way!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Just be a good girl and submit to me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; Faith charged forward and punched.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus&rsquo;s eyes glowed a hauntingly scary white color, and suddenly, she remained frozen in place in that position, with her right arm extended, about to make a punch. Her body would not move no matter how much she willed it, it&rsquo;s as if time is frozen for her. (This feeling again? What did he do?)</p></p>

<p><p>Now that she cannot move, Rubeus inched his way towards her. She&rsquo;s as helpless as a statue. He stepped to the side and touched her forearm.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus caressed her arm, moving his hand towards her elbow and into her upper arm. He lowered his head and kissed her wrist. He kept gliding his lips on her arm, making successive kisses towards her shoulder.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;S-Stop...&rdquo; she said. Not being able to move and having Rubeus touch her is uncomfortable, and she tried really hard to move her arm, but nothing happened. Even though Faith used all of her willpower, she could not move a single muscle.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus kissed her upper arm, and then her shoulder. Then he stood behind her and put his hand on her shoulders.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith grew nervous, she swallowed hard, and her eyeballs followed him, wondering what he&rsquo;s going to do now. He massaged her shoulders with his hands while his face is in her hair.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mmm you smell good.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;S-Stop it...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus kissed the back of her shoulder. Mch. The room was silent, so every kiss was clearly audible. Her skin tastes good to his lips, so he continued to kiss her shoulder and her neck.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith winced and moaned in pain. &ldquo;Uhhh...stop...please!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I wonder what&rsquo;s down here?&rdquo; Rubeus placed his hands on her breasts.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith gasped. He squeezed them tightly.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Uhhhh!!&rdquo; she moaned.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus fondled her breasts, he squished them and caressed them with his hands.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ughhhh! Uhhhhh!!&rdquo; Poor Faith could not handle the pain and discomfort and groaned out loud. Her face was blushing red with embarrassment.</p></p>

<p><p>Her breasts were so round and soft, and it felt good to grab them with his fingers. They were squishy, yet firm at the same time, and it feels natural to grab them and play with them.</p></p>

<p><p>He was smelling her hair and fondling her at the same time, while his body was leaning against hers. To be able to dominate a woman like this while standing up is the ultimate high for Rubeus. For Faith, this is sheer torture, it is unbearable. She groaned in agony, her face wincing. Even though she cannot move her body, she cans still feel the discomfort of being groped by another man&rsquo;s hands.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Just relax.&rdquo; he whispered softly into her ear. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get used to it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Is he trying to comfort her? There is something really wrong about this. It&rsquo;s as if Rubeus was trying to seduce her, whispering sweet nothings into her ear, as if he&rsquo;s her lover. This thought alone was repulsive, it is a fate worst than hell.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus then moved his left hand down to her thigh, while his right hand continued to fondle her breast. &ldquo;Now...&rdquo; he said, gliding his hand up her thigh, &ldquo;I am going to make you my woman.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...please...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>His hand went between her legs and into the ribbons, and she screamed in agony. &ldquo;Ughhh!! Uhhhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>No one can see what his hand was doing in there, but one can imagine what kind of sick things Rubeus was doing to her. His hand was rummaging in that area aggressively.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith screamed out loud, unable to contain herself from the pain and discomfort. Her face was blushing redder, and her eyes were closed, her face grimacing from the pain.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, she has a slight feeling on her left elbow. It twitched a little bit, and she felt like she could move her arms if she focused hard enough. But in this situation, she had a dire need to move her muscles. The pain was too much to handle, and somehow, she managed to move her arms and shoved him away.</p></p>

<p><p>She stepped back to a safer distance, her arms crossed over her chest, hands over her breasts. Perhaps Rubeus&rsquo;s spell wears off after a while, or perhaps she broke free from the spell with her own will; whichever the case may be, it matters little, because she still has to deal with the situation in front of her.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s hands instinctively covered her breasts, but who can blame her, after being groped in such a dirty way? Rubeus inched his way towards her, while she retreated, fearing for her life. Even if it is futile, all she can do is fight. Faith was angry about being violated, and she drew up her fists and fought. *Whoosh whoosh* Rubeus dodged her fists and stepped back.</p></p>

<p><p>If punching won&rsquo;t work, then maybe a kick will. Faith raised her right leg, performing a high kick. Before the kick could reach him, Rubeus used his Freeze spell. Just like before, his eyes glowed a hauntingly scary white color and Faith&rsquo;s body froze in action.</p></p>

<p><p>There was no time to figure out the secret to Rubeus&rsquo;s spell and how to break it. Every time he used it, the same thing happens, she is frozen in place like a statue. This time, however, is even worse, because she was in the middle of a kick, and her legs are spread open.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus stepped to the side of her leg and touched her ankle. &ldquo;No...stop...&rdquo; she pleaded. Unable to do anything, all she can do is beg...but her begging only adds fuel to the fire...her begs and cries of mercy make him more aroused.</p></p>

<p><p>He lifted her leg a little higher so that it&rsquo;s close to his chin, and he kissed her ankle.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;S-stop it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He made soft kisses on her shin, moving his lips all the way to her knee, kissing her skin and caressing it gently, while holding her leg with his hands. He continued to move up, kissing her upper thigh, and feeling it all over with his dirty hands.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;S-stop! Uhh...Stop it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>His face was now close to her stomach. His right hand still holding her leg, he wrapped his left hand around her back. He lowered her back, so that they were face to face, with her leg still extended. Faith gasped, staring into the eyes of the enemy. This was too close for comfort.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus kissed her lips, swallowing them and sucking them dry. &ldquo;Mmmmffff!&rdquo; He leaned into her more and more, and they fell down on the ground. *Thud* Faith was unable to move, and Rubeus did whatever he felt like...</p></p>

<p><p>While walking down the road that leads to the palace, Marianna found a man lying on the floor. She hurried over to him and turned him over. To her surprise, it was Squire.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Squire?&rdquo; she called out. There was no response. He was battered and bruised, and probably unconscious for a while. Marianna continued to call his name and slap his face. &ldquo;Squire? You okay?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Finally, he moaned a little and opened his eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What happened to you?&rdquo; she asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;They took the palace...and they&rsquo;re holding the king hostage.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna gasped. &ldquo;What about Faith?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh. She&rsquo;s been captured...she&rsquo;s in grave danger. Ugh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who did this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It was Rubeus...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;R2_PurpleRibbons2&quot;></a>Purple Ribbons - Part 2</p></p>

<p><p>Lying on the floor, Faith crawled backwards to distance herself from the menacing man with silver hair. As Rubeus inched his way towards her, she crawled desperately to get away from him. He could have her at any time, but he wanted to take it slowly, like a game of cat and mouse. And the cat will have his meal soon.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; Faith was breathing hard, her eyes wide open with fear. Still weak and injured, she crawled slow, even though she tried hard. &ldquo;No...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Eventually, her back hit the wall. She leaned against the wall and stood up, with one hand covering her breasts.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now be a good girl and come here.&rdquo; Rubeus tried to grab her, but she dodged to the side.</p></p>

<p><p>She stood facing him, still backing away step by step. Rubeus approached her, and she turned around to run. He grabbed her arm and pulled her into him. She gasped.</p></p>

<p><p>He forced his lips into hers. &ldquo;Mmmff!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Then he pulled the ribbon on her breasts and tugged it hard, making her spin away. &ldquo;Aaaah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>While spinning, Rubeus used the Freeze spell on her over and over. Rubeus laughed as he did.</p></p>

<p><p>He kept on pulling the ribbon, and using the spell on her, as she spins away, more of her body was revealed. At last, all the ribbons came off her, and she fell on the bed. *Plop*</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus came to the bed and stared at her naked form. It is finally time for the main event. Poor Faith cannot move a muscle, and prepared herself for the worst. She was toyed with the entire time, and the worst is yet to come. Even if she can move, it is still futile...so what is the point of struggling? It always ends up the same way. Even though she wished really hard it wouldn&rsquo;t happen, it still does...</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus grabbed her ankle and kneeled down on the bed. He stared at her leg, admiring its beauty, and proceeded to kiss her ankle. He made successive kisses on her shin, moving his lips to her knee.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith just lay there passively, letting him do whatever he wanted. Her head facing sideways, staring at nothing. Even though it was embarrassing to have someone stare at her leg and touch it all over, and even if it&rsquo;s disgusting for him to kiss it, there is absolutely nothing she can do about it.</p></p>

<p><p>He continued to kiss her thigh, raising her leg into the air as his head moved lower and lower...into that area. Then he put his face into that area and just let himself loose.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith moaned and grimaced in pain. Her eyes twitched and her head tossed and turned. Her fingers squeezed the bed sheet tightly. Even if she can move, it is only this much, so she can endure the pain. But this kind of enduring is different than anything kind of enduring that ever exists... people endure bitter medicine, they endure putting alcohol on wounds... but this is nothing like that at all.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus then put his face into her breasts. He is on top of her completely. In this position, he can do whatever he wants. Everything has been leading up to this moment, before this, everything was foreplay.</p></p>

<p><p>He kissed her shoulders and her neck, while she tossed and turned. Even if she can move her head, it is only this much. Her fingers grabbed the bed sheet and squeezed it tightly. He continued to ravage her behind the curtains, while she moaned and groaned.</p></p>


<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="d">[D] - The Imprisoned Princess. Trapped In the Castle</span></p></center>

<p><p><a name=&quot;R2_PurpleRibbons3&quot;></a>Purple Ribbons - Part 3</p></p>

<p><p>Holding a wooden stick, Faith snuck into Rubeus&rsquo;s room. She was still wearing the purple ribbons and moving around while dressed like this is inconvenient and embarrassing. But she is tired of being mistreated, so she endured and waited for the right time to retaliate.</p></p>

<p><p>She glided her back along the wall, clenching the stick tightly in her grip.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus was sitting down cross legged and meditating. His body emitted a dark purple ki. He was sitting in the center of a magic circle. There&rsquo;s a five cornered star connected to the circle, and there are candles placed on each star corner.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus&rsquo;s back was facing her. While meditating, he must be unconscious, and she figured this is the perfect opportunity to strike. Rubeus is too powerful for her to fight normally, so to hit him while his guard is down is the only way she can win, and she must make use of this golden chance.</p></p>

<p><p>She walked over to him, taking each step carefully as to not make a sound.</p></p>

<p><p>Once she&rsquo;s within striking distance, she raised the stick in the air.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Rubeus opened his eyes. He was conscious the entire time, and felt her coming without having to use his eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith swings the stick down, but it hit Rubeus&rsquo;s shield. It&rsquo;s like hitting an invisible electric bubble, and the electricity stopped her stick from moving further. The stick bounced off and flew away somewhere. She was shocked.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus turned around to face her, still sitting down. &ldquo;So, you like to strike people in the back, princess?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith stepped back in fear.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My my, I never thought you&rsquo;d be the type to do that. But in a way, I&rsquo;m impressed.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He used his Freeze spell, and his eyes glowed white, and by now, she knew this is one of his spells, and it is nearly impossible to break free. Once under this spell, she is immobile and helpless.</p></p>

<p><p>Then he opened his palm, causing Faith to step forward. She was surprised. Not only can he freeze her body, but he can use telekinesis as well?</p></p>

<p><p>She took another step forward against her will. No matter how much willpower she has, her body won&rsquo;t listen to her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Come here.&rdquo; he said.</p></p>

<p><p>Her legs bent down and she fell on top of him, her face landed on his shoulder. It looked liked they were embracing.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus grabbed her by the back, and pulled her down, until her body is lying on his legs. She&rsquo;s under him, and they&rsquo;re face to face, their noses almost touching.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mine.&rdquo; Rubeus kissed her lips and Faith&rsquo;s eyes widened with disbelief. He enjoyed the open mouth kiss, his lips swallowed hers and even the insides of her mouth. For her, this is completely disgusting. Poor Faith can&rsquo;t do anything but suffer.</p></p>

<p><p>Then Rubeus let go of her back, and he put his knees over her legs, and now he&rsquo;s completely on top of her. He put his face in her breasts, while she screamed and moaned.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith still can&rsquo;t move her body. Faith&rsquo;s fingers grabbed the floor, that&rsquo;s all she can do right now. Her head tossed and turned left and right and up. Her legs thrashed about, they were trapped between his legs.</p></p>

<p><p>She screamed as he ravaged her in the middle of this magic circle. Even though Rubeus&rsquo;s meditation was interrupted, he doesn&rsquo;t mind taking a break from it so he can enjoy Faith&rsquo;s body. In fact, his meditation still continues, his body still releases the dark purple ki. Rubeus was enjoying it more and more, and the sexual activity actually aides his meditation.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith screamed in agony as her body is being ravaged and her soul is being drained at the same time. But alas, in this secluded room, they are all alone, and no one can hear her screams.</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;R2_Submission&quot;></a>Submission</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus walked over to the bed and pulled the curtains aside. Faith had not moved from the bed since he was last here. She was kneeling on the bed, staring down at nothing. Ever since she was stripped naked, she was not given the liberty to wear clothes, besides these purple ribbons wrapped around her body.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith had one hand over her breasts, clenching her fingers tightly against her palm. Rubeus liked the way she looks - in his mind, that&rsquo;s how an ideal woman should be - submissive and hardly wearing anything.</p></p>

<p><p>Her skin was smooth and flawless, and easy on the eyes. Her arms are skinny and frail, her hands are delicate and fragile, and her nails are round and makes her fingers look good. Her legs are peach colored, they are just the right size and those curves are irresistible.</p></p>

<p><p>Those ribbons are the perfect look for her. Rubeus should&rsquo;ve thought of this earlier. She was trembling a little bit, and he knows that she&rsquo;s afraid of him. This is exactly what he wants. If she is afraid of him, then she will respect him, and submit to him completely.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was exhausted from enduring all the suffering ever since she was captured. It is abundantly clear that her powers don&rsquo;t hold a candle to Rubeus&rsquo;s powers, and a head on confrontation is useless. She&rsquo;s had a rebellious spirit her whole life, but now, possibly for the first time, her spirit is vanishing. She no longer has the will to fight...</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You should relax. After all, the palace will be better off under my control. I am going to make this kingdom better than it was before.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith looked at him. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s...my father?&rdquo; she asked in a meager voice.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmm. Shouldn&rsquo;t you be more worried about yourself?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s eyeballs darted to the side. &ldquo;Please...don&rsquo;t kill him.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus smiled, knowing that he has her right where he wants her. She&rsquo;s finally starting to lose her fighting spirit. And it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before she becomes his slave, one who is completely obedient to him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. He&rsquo;s still alive for now.&rdquo; Rubeus responded.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kill him...&rdquo; said Faith, with a tone of relief.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t kill him. As long as you remain obedient.&rdquo; he replied.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;F-Fine.&rdquo; she replied. Her voice quivering, and her eyes shaking nervously.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus placed his hands on her shoulders, and she gasped in surprise. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made the right choice. Your father lives and no one has to get hurt.&rdquo; he said, gazing into her eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>She just stared at him like a deer in headlights. How strange it is that this villain, her mortal enemy, is trying to comfort her. Or maybe he is not. But still, Faith had no choice but to listen to him and submit to his demands...she already tried fighting back, but it was in vain.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus leaned in closer to her face. &ldquo;You made the right choice, princess.&rdquo; he said in almost a whisper.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith just sat there, frozen, as she stared into his bottomless blue eyes. His voice sent chills down her spine, and it seems as if his eyes were staring right into her soul.</p></p>

<p><p>Then Rubeus leaned in and kissed her on the lips. Her eyes grew wide open, and tears dripped down the corner of her eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>His grip tightened on her shoulders. Then he pushed her down, along with himself, and he was on top of her.</p></p>

<p><p>Now in this position, Rubeus can do whatever he wants to her, and unleash the inner beast inside of him. He put his face on her breasts and snuggled them, and Faith groaned in pain, and her head tossed left and right.</p></p>

<p><p>She no longer had the energy to scream out loud, instead what came out were moans. The miserable moans of a wounded animal about to be devoured by the beast.</p></p>

<p><p>Faiths&rsquo; fingers grabbed the bed sheet tightly. She knew that it was all over. There is no hope left... this is the price that she must pay...as his prisoner and sex slave.</p></p>

<p><p>From the view outside the bed, Rubeus&rsquo;s shadow was on top of her shadow, and they became one figure. Her moans and cries echoed throughout the bedroom.</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;R2_CrutonAssignment&quot;></a>Cruton's Assignment</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus walked out of the bedroom and shut the door behind him. In the hallway Cruton was there waiting for his master.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Cruton.&rdquo; His master called, and Cruton bowed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I am going to open the portal to the demon world. Your job is to make sure the princess doesn&rsquo;t escape. Guard this door.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I understand.&rdquo; Cruton replied. He has said these words many times over his career so the words came out of his mouth mechanically, much like a reflex. Rubeus did not even wait for his reply before walking away.</p></p>

<p><p>Standing in front of a door all day is a boring and mindless job and Cruton has been doing this for hours. There is no telling how much longer he needed to be here, it could be hours or days. He wanted to do something mischievous and since his master wasn&rsquo;t here, he opened the door to the princess&rsquo;s room and peered inside. He snuck inside the room and shut the door.</p></p>

<p><p>The princess was visible through the thin curtains. Her <strong>silhouette</strong> was laying horizontally and not moving. She might be asleep, which is even better for him. He brushed aside the curtains and his eyes got a treat.</p></p>

<p><p>The woman was lying in bed, practically naked except for ribbons that bound her from top to bottom, covering her private parts. Her <strong>panties</strong> were shoved into her mouth, rendering her speechless, and all she could do was make noises through her mouth. The ribbons were looped by several layers around her breasts and down to her hips. There was one extra ribbon that tied her legs together, ending at the ankles. Her ankles were securely looped by two layers to ensure it doesn&rsquo;t come loose. Most of her legs were revealed as well as her feet.</p></p>

<p><p>Her wrists were bound behind her back by a piece of ribbon, also in several layers, making it impossible for her to loosen it. Because of this, her elbows were bent at an angle.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So you must be Rubeus&rsquo;s plaything.&rdquo; Cruton could not believe his luck. So his assignment is to make sure this naked, defenseless woman doesn&rsquo;t escape. This set up made her movements were very limited with few exceptions. For her to sit up was hard, but standing is impossible, let alone escape. She was already gagged so she can&rsquo;t call for help. She was a lamb for the slaughter.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus does not want anyone to touch his woman, but he is not here. Faith was gagged so she cannot tell anybody what Cruton was about to do to her. As long as his master doesn&rsquo;t find out, he can do whatever he wants to this woman.</p></p>

<p><p>Cruton was already sprawled on the bed. He placed his hand on her stomach and tantalizingly moved it to her breast. He squeezed her left breast, causing her to moan. &ldquo;Mmmfff...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He must be screwing you day and night.&rdquo; Her breast felt nice and plump. He could tell that it&rsquo;s real based on the firmness and shape of it. He squished it like play dough. When he grew bored of that, he removed his hand from her breast and placed his palm on her face. She turned away. &ldquo;Nnnn!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He placed with her face with his fingers as if he&rsquo;s her lover. &ldquo;What a pretty little face you have. I&rsquo;m sure he can&rsquo;t get his hands off you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>His fingers started twirling a strand of her hair. Then his fingers gently brushed her cheek. &ldquo;Mffff...&rdquo; Then proceeded to touch her chin and her neck.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But now it&rsquo;s my turn to have a taste.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He put his focus on her chest area...he put his face between her <strong>breasts</strong>. Faith moaned while her head tossed and turned. &ldquo;Mmmfff...mmmfff...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Her breasts were so soft and squishy that he could have stayed here all day. His face went left and right, bumping his nose and mouth against her twins. Even though the ribbons were there, he could feel the skin at the top of her breasts. His right hand held her forearm and caressed it, moving up and down, occasionally grabbing her elbow. His left hand did the same with her left arm.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith tried desperately to loosen the knot on her wrists but the knot was too tight and there were too many loops. Her arms were fidgeting. He noticed the movement on her arms, but he thought nothing of it.</p></p>

<p><p>Cruton&rsquo;s face moved up slightly so he could kiss her sternum...he stayed here for a while. Occasionally, he&rsquo;d move down to her cleavage and up to her jugular vein.</p></p>

<p><p>If there is a heaven, it must be in this part of this woman&rsquo;s body. His nose was brushing against her twins and smelling them. He enjoyed kissing her sternum as well...it had nothing but smooth skin and she smelled good over there.</p></p>

<p><p>The skin in her arms was soft and smooth, much like her face. Faith continued to let out moans of discomfort and pain. Her head titled backwards as his head was hitting her chin. He made kisses up her neck and made it to her chin. He kissed her jaw line as her head turned to left. She winced as he kissed her cheek all over.</p></p>

<p><p>He was enjoying every kiss and touch...besides being a minion of a sorcerer, Cruton is but a man. He enjoys tasting a woman&rsquo;s body. But this is not just any woman...she is the princess. So this is what a princess&rsquo;s body is like? Everything about her was high quality. Her skin, her curves, her smell. He was losing control and let his instincts take over.</p></p>

<p><p>While leaning over her, his hand glided down her breast and squeezed it briefly and continued to move down her stomach. It made its way to her inner thigh.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I wonder if he&rsquo;s been down here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> As soon as she felt his hand on her thigh, she knew what he wanted to do. Her head was facing down. &ldquo;Nnnngggg! Nnnnggg!&rdquo; She was trying to say something to him...but all that came out of her mouth were muffled sounds. But it is clear to everyone what she wanted to say.</p></p>

<p><p>Cruton&rsquo;s hand moved closer...brush the ribbons up...and closer and closer...and his eyes lit up. His hand went deep inside the ribbons, violating her lady parts.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mmmmffff!!&rdquo; she moaned louder and more violently than before. Her body was squirming and her head titled backwards.</p></p>

<p><p>Cruton enjoyed this very much...his fingers kept violating her lady parts...it was soft and wet. He was pleased that he could spend so little effort to get such a big reaction out of her. &ldquo;Mmmffff! Mmmfff!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>When he grew bored of that, he set his sights on something else. The ribbons around her legs, unlike the rest of her body, were loose and sparse. Most of her legs were revealed but he wanted to see all of her skin. He pulled the ribbon on her thigh, making her roll a few times to the other side of the large bed.</p></p>

<p><p>She ended up on her stomach with her backside up. Her wrists were seen tied up by a tight knot. Cruton lay on top of her completely. Faith kept pleading him to stop. &ldquo;Mmmmmffff!&rdquo; He put his face in her hair and smelled it. He held her pony tail and played with it. Then he smelled it.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s hands pulled hard, using all the strength she had, but it was no use, the knot was too tight.</p></p>

<p><p>He put his face in her cheek and kissed her cheek and smelled her. &ldquo;Mmmff!&rdquo; He went down to kiss her neck. The room was silent except for Faith&rsquo;s moaning. Each time his lips smooched her skin it was audible. He went down to the middle of her back. &ldquo;Mmmfff! Mmmfff!&rdquo; He went down to the topmost ribbon and stayed there. The skin on her back felt different than the front, but it tasted good just like the rest of her. He proceeded to kiss her scapula, making each successive kiss higher and higher. He kissed her trapezoids while smelling her hair.</p></p>

<p><p>The poor girl suffered throughout the ordeal as she desperately tried to free her wrists.</p></p>

<p><p> Eventually, Cruton grew bored of this position, as he wanted more excitement. He pulled the ribbon on her thigh, making her roll away. Even more of her beautiful legs were revealed and his eyes were pleased.</p></p>

<p><p>He crawled on top of her and buried his face into her breasts just like before. His face went upwards to her clavicle and kissed it. He went to her shoulder and kissed it on his way to her neck. &ldquo;Mmmm...mmmm...&rdquo; He smooched her jaw line and her cheek. Faith winced and her head turned away. &ldquo;Mmmm...mmm...&rdquo; Her eyes were barely open and her face showed discomfort and pain.</p></p>

<p><p>But Cruton did not care about her feelings; he did not even treat her as a person. She is just a female body for his enjoyment, and the more she suffered, the more aroused he became. He glided his lips toward hers and he touched the silky fabric sticking out of her mouth.</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;Cruton_removes_panties&quot;></a></p></p>

<p><p>He wanted to know what her lips taste like but the panties were in the way. He pulled it out and she coughed. *Kuff kuff* He let the panties drape over his index finger and spun it around.</p></p>

<p><p>He stretched the edges of her panties like a rubber band. He pointed the panties at her face and stretched it, and then used it to hit her cheek. *twang* She winced. He stretched it again and used it to hit her cheek. *twang*</p></p>

<p><p>Then he tossed the panties somewhere on the bed. &ldquo;Please untie me!&rdquo; said the princess as Cruton lowered his face to meet hers. &ldquo;I have to save my kingd-&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He planted his <strong>lips</strong> into hers. &ldquo;MMMMFFFFFF!&rdquo; Her eyes grew wide open from the shock. The poor girl only thought about saving her kingdom, but the only thing Cruton cares about is playing with her body. This has to be the uncomfortable thing to happen to her thus far, to have a complete stranger violate her lips. She had to stare at his face up close, which is way too close. And she could not breathe. And his lips were swallowing hers and his nose was brushing against her nose and cheek.</p></p>

<p><p>Her wrists struggled desperately to loosen the knot. Each and every second felt like an eternity and it was unbearable. &ldquo;Mmmmfffff!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Cruton&rsquo;s eyes remained closed as he tasted her lips fully. Her lips tasted sweet and juicy and wet, like the sweetest fruit known to man.</p></p>

<p><p>When he finally released her lips, she out a sigh of relief, now that she can breathe again. Cruton wasted no time, and glided his lips to her neck, kissing her neck and jugular vein. Her head tilted up and moaned. &ldquo;Uhhh...&rdquo; Then he lips went to her sternum and kissed it at the same time his nose was smelling her. Faith panted for breath and moaned slightly in reaction to his touches. &ldquo;Uhhh&#8230;uhhh&#8230;&rdquo; Her lips were the main dish and this is the after dinner appetizer. &ldquo;Uhhh&#8230;uhhh&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He gradually became more aroused as he violated her more. There was so many fun things to do to a woman&rsquo;s body&#8230;like kiss her, smell her, and grab her with his hands. He also gets to listen to the noises she was making. It is certainly is a feast for the five senses.</p></p>

<p><p> Then he focused on her legs. There was only one piece of ribbon tying up her shin and ankles. He pulled the loose ribbon, freeing her <strong>legs</strong> while she spun away. Now that her legs were freed, she sat up and crawled backwards. &ldquo;No, please don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Cruton crawled towards her and reached for her. She shrieked and threw one foot at him. He caught her by the ankle as she kicked randomly. He grabbed her other ankle and dragged her into him, making her back land on the bed. *Plop*</p></p>

<p><p>Now that he untied her legs, it is time to enjoy his newly unwrapped present. He lifted up her right leg and placed it on his shoulder. He rubbed her heel against his entire face, feeling her skin with his skin. Her skin was so soft and smooth, not only did it look good, but she felt good too. She truly is a princess as he can tell she takes care of herself. He rubbed her heel and ankle against his chin.</p></p>

<p><p>He kissed her <strong>ankle</strong> and her heel, making each kiss tantalizingly slow. He glided his lips to her shin, making sure to kiss every inch of it. Faith winced with her eyes shut and her head turned sideways. As his lips violated her shin, his hand held her calf, the muscle in the back of the leg. Her calf was round and firm and nice to touch. His lips made their way to her knee.</p></p>

<p><p>After that, he placed her leg down, keeping her knee bent up. He kissed her thigh, which was inclined. His hand was caressing the inside of her <strong>thigh</strong> while his lips touched the front part. Her thigh was smooth and creamy, and tasted good to his lips. It was like tasting a peach that&rsquo;s fresh from the farm. He glided his lips downwards, getting closer and closer to the ribbons. And inside the ribbons is the forbidden fruit, and soon he will have a taste of it.</p></p>

<p><p> His lips kept moving inch by inch until he reached the ribbons. His hand continued to move on her thigh, tantalizingly moving towards the ribbons. Faith winced with her head turned sideways, her eyes barely open and shaking in their eyelids. She could feel his hand move closer to her <strong>womanhood</strong>. &ldquo;No...not there...please...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Cruton&rsquo;s hand reached the ribbon around her hips, and continued to move inside...and finally, it reached the forbidden fruit. The pain came as a surprise and she groaned loudly. &ldquo;Ughhhhh! Ughhhhh!&rdquo; Her head turned side to side as she suffered. &ldquo;Ughhhhh! Ughhhhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>After what was an eternity, Cruton finally released his hand from between her legs. He lay down on her body, putting his face on her right <strong>breast</strong>, while his hand squeezed her left breast. His hand squeezed it like it was dough, as if trying to change its shape.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith moaned while her head tossed and turned. &ldquo;Uhhh, uhhh, uhhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Cruton continued for a while, as he has no reason to stop. Her breasts were soft like pillows, and he enjoyed lying on top of her body. The poor girl continued to suffer and moan softly as he kept playing with her breast. Faith had never felt this helpless before, being violated sexually and unable to do a thing about it. Her wrists were bound behind her back, and she tried desperately to untie the knot on her wrists, but it&rsquo;s hard to focus when she&rsquo;s being ravaged.</p></p>

<p><p>Cruton moved his face towards her shoulder, causing her to turn sideways. He kissed her shoulder and neck while smelling her, as his hand continued to play with her breast.</p></p>

<p><p>After what felt like a long time, Cruton finally grew bored of this. He flipped her over to he could harass her from behind. First, he smelled her hair and sighed. He pressed his face into her shoulder and kissed it several times, smothering his lips all over a small area of her skin. His lips went down an inch to taste her some more. After each kiss he went down an inch until his lips reached the ribbons.</p></p>

<p><p>He wanted to see more of her skin and wanted to rip everything off, but her <strong>wrists</strong> were in the way. He undid her wrists but made sure to secure them properly. He put both hands above her head, and retied her wrists with the same ribbon. With her hands out of the way, he can now see her entire back.</p></p>

<p><p>Cruton pulled a loose ribbon on her waist, making her roll away. She moaned as she rolled several times before stopping. &ldquo;Uhhh&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He crawled towards her and lays down on top of her, putting his face into her cheek. She turned away and winced. He grabbed her pony tail and played with it in his hand and smelled it. He kissed her neck and the bottom of her chin.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let me go&#8230;I have to stop Rubeus from destroying the kingdom.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I would worry more about yourself.&rdquo; He kissed her <strong>lips</strong>.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mmmmmfffff!&rdquo; Faith pulled her wrists to free herself from the knot, but it was too tight. While she desperately pulled she continued to suffer as her lips were violated.</p></p>

<p><p>After a long time, he finally released her lips so he can breath. Faith gasped for breath but she had no time to rest as Cruton shoved his face into her sternum. Just as before, he smelled her skin while tasting her skin with his lips. It is an act he will never get tired of. Occasionally he kissed her clavicle and her shoulders and would return to her sternum.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith moaned and groaned while her head tossed and turned. &ldquo;Uhhh...uhhh...uhhh.&rdquo; But despite her suffering, her wrists still tried to break free. No, actually, she must break free to stop the torture...every second is one second too long. The more he violated her, the harder she struggled.</p></p>

<p><p>Cruton shifted his body to the left to expose her leg. His hand went down to her thigh and caressed it, squeezing her thigh and gliding his hand up and down to feel her up. As his hand violated her leg, his face was in between her breasts. The top half of her breasts were exposed while the bottom half was covered by ribbons. But it felt as if the ribbons were not there, as Cruton snuggled them, turning his face left and right.</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;Cruton_violates_wall&quot;></a></p></p>

<p><p>All this time, her wrists were pulling hard. Suddenly, the knot was loose and she pulled a few more times and the ribbon finally came off her wrists. She placed her palms on his shoulders and pushed him up, which caught him by surprise. She shoved him to the side, making him roll away. Faith turned over to her stomach to crawl away from him.</p></p>

<p><p>Her head reached the edge of the bed and she could see the floor. Her right hand reached forward, her fingers open trying to grab the air. She was desperate to escape this bed. Suddenly, Cruton grabbed her, wrapping his arm around her back. He turned her over, causing her to grunt. &ldquo;Ugh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He shoved his face in her breasts and her head dangled off the bed. &ldquo;Uhhh! Uhhh!&rdquo; She had little strength to begin with, and she used it all up trying to escape. She had no strength left to resist...her fingers squeezed the bed sheet...that&rsquo;s all she can do.</p></p>

<p><p>Cruton let himself loose, his face violating her breasts while his hand went down to grab her thigh.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Uuuuuh! Uhhhh!&rdquo; Faith moaned. This was more uncomfortable than before, as her head was upside down, her ponytail touching the floor. The blood was rushing to her head and she felt light headed.</p></p>

<p><p>At this rate, he is going to have his way with her body completely...just like Rubeus did. That was already bad enough, but now another man is going to do the same to her? Such a thing is inconceivable.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, an <strong>image</strong> of her father appeared in her mind. That&rsquo;s right, Faith has to save her father and his kingdom. She can&rsquo;t afford to waste time here, being harassed in bed by a guy she doesn&rsquo;t even know. She is a princess...the princess of her kingdom and she doesn&rsquo;t belong here. Her fingers squeezed the bed sheet tighter. Suddenly, her eyes opened wide.</p></p>

<p><p>Her arms moved on their own and shoved Cruton&rsquo;s body away from her. He rolled over to his back. She shoved him with her arms and kicked him with her legs, making him fall off the bed.</p></p>

<p><p>She crawled forward until she fell off the bed. *Thud* She landed on her back in awkward position, but she turned around to her stomach. She knew that Cruton was nearby and she crawled desperately. Faith was weak and tired but she used up every ounce of strength she had to make her body move. The only thing on her mind is to reach the wall that&rsquo;s in front of her. She panted for breath and could hear her own breathing.</p></p>

<p><p>The wall was within arm&rsquo;s reach, and her palm touched it. She leaned against the wall, using it as leverage to get on her knees, and eventually on her feet. It took some effort, but at last she was standing up. Both her palms were placed on the wall as she continued to pant for breath.</p></p>

<p><p> Suddenly, Cruton appeared and grabbed her arms and she gasped. He shoved her against the wall, pressing her face against it. &ldquo;Ugh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Going somewhere?&rdquo; he said in a half-whisper. He pressed his face against her cheek and she can feel his breath. It sent chills down her spine.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please stop!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He proceeded to kiss her back and shoulders. Mch. Mch. Her skin tasted good to his lips. He pressed his body against her soft body as his lips continued to taste her. He could stay here all day. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to see all of you.&rdquo; Cruton whispered. His hand touched the side of her breast, which was squished against the wall. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re about to become my woman.&rdquo; He resumed smooching her shoulder.</p></p>

<p><p>There was something unsettling about what he just said. His words sent chills down her spine. His words reminded Faith of something...in the past a monk said something similar to her. The situation from the past was almost the same, a man had her trapped against the wall and he was violating her. It was a repressed memory that she hoped would never resurface.</p></p>

<p><p>Cruton turned her around to expose her front. He kissed her lips. &ldquo;Mmmmfffff.&rdquo; He shoved his face into her shoulder and smooched it, then went down to her partially exposed breasts and began munching on them. Faith moaned. &ldquo;Ughhh, ughhh, ughhh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The memory of the nightmare that occurred in the temple became stronger. She did not remember the entire event, but only fragments of images emerged...how the fallen monks violated her and took away everything that&rsquo;s precious to her. Suddenly, she snapped and her body moved on her own. Her arms grabbed his head and shoved him to the floor. *Thud*</p></p>

<p><p>Faith quickly and desperately limped to the exit, with one arm leaning against the wall for support. She managed to leave the room and went down the dark hallway. Before her was a flight of stairs that led to the roof. She thought if she could get to the top of the stairs, she can escape this nightmare and she will finally be free.</p></p>

<p><p>With her left hand holding onto the rails, she took the first step. Her heart was racing and she panted for breath. Her entire focus was on the exit at the top. She made it halfway up the stairs when Cruton appeared.</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;Cruton_violates_stairs&quot;></a></p></p>

<p><p> He noticed the loose ribbon hanging off her waist and had a naughty thought. He chased her up the stairs and pulled the ribbon. &ldquo;Uuuuuuh!&rdquo; Faith was losing balance and her foot slipped off the step and she fell into him.</p></p>

<p><p>His face was in her hair and he immediately grabbed her breasts. &ldquo;Uuuh! Uuuh!&rdquo; Faith struggled to escape while he struggled to restrain her. They both lost their footing and fell. Cruton fell all the way to the floor while Faith fell parallel to the steps, so she rolled down halfway. *Thud thud thud*</p></p>

<p><p>Her entire body was hurting from the fall. Despite the pain, she crawled up, still staring at the exit. Cruton crawled towards her and grabbed her leg. &ldquo;Get over here, you!&rdquo; Faith turned around to look at him, and tried to shake him off. Cruton will not let go so she tried in vain to crawl up, her arm reaching the air.</p></p>

<p><p>Cruton got on top of her and pressed his face into her <strong>back</strong>. He smothered and kissed her back and shoulders while his hands reached around to grab her breasts. &ldquo;Uugh! Uugh!&rdquo; Being violated on the stairs was much worse than being violated on the bed. Her body was pressed against the uneven concrete with a man on top of her.</p></p>

<p><p>He turned her over to violate her front. He buried his face into her breasts. &ldquo;Uhhh! Uhhh!&rdquo; She desperately shoved his head away. After a few seconds, she managed to push his face away from her breasts, and she crawled up one step. His face was buried in her stomach and his arms held onto her back. She kept pushing his head and eventually she succeeded. She raised her leg and kicked him in the shoulder, making him fall more.</p></p>

<p><p>She flipped over to her stomach and got on her feet. Cruton grabbed her from behind and they struggled. He took a misstep and lost his balance, and they both fell all the way to the bottom. *Wham* She ended up falling down on top of him.</p></p>

<p><p>Both of them were in a daze and remained like that for a few seconds. Faith woke up first and realized that she&rsquo;s not on the floor. Her face landed in his chest. She gasped and quickly got up on her elbows and knees. Cruton suddenly woke up and smiled. He grabbed her arms and flipped her over, and now he&rsquo;s on top of her. &ldquo;You enjoy this, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Without wasting any time, he started violating her front. &ldquo;You were just playing hard to get.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was still dazed from the fall and too weak to resist. She moaned and groaned from the torture and discomfort of having a man&rsquo;s face between her breasts. &ldquo;Uuuh! Uuuh! Uuuh!&rdquo; Even if the ribbons were there, it still felt disgusting and dirty, and she might as well be naked.</p></p>

<p><p>His hand reached down to violate her thigh. &ldquo;Uuuh! Uuuh!&rdquo; She moaned while her head tossed left and right.</p></p>

<p><p>Cruton let himself loose on the poor girl, holding nothing back. Faith&rsquo;s fingers clenched into a fist...it was all she could do. She has no energy left after falling so many times and her body did not respond to her.</p></p>

<p><p>It is all over...he&rsquo;s going to have his way with her on this staircase. She fought so hard to escape but still ended up like this...it was all for nothing. Not only was her body broken but her spirit too. Why does this have to happen to her? Is it because she&rsquo;s the princess? Or maybe she&rsquo;s a woman? Maybe she should just accept her fate...</p></p>

<p><p>Then she thought about Darian and Squire...and Marianna. They would never give up. Marianna has always been encouraging to her. They encourage each other and have been through tough times and survived many challenges. How can she face Marianna if she just gave up right here?</p></p>

<p><p>Even if she wanted to escape, her body was still too tired to respond. She only had energy to scream and move her head. She must escape now or else it will be too late. At this rate, she will end up like that time...when the fallen monks violated her. The mere thought of that horror made her pupils dilate and eyes open wide. Her fingers clenched unconsciously several times until they became tight enough to make a fist.</p></p>

<p><p>Her arm moved on its own and pushed Cruton up, then put her palms under his chest to shove him to the side.</p></p>

<p><p>She crawled over to the wall and leaned against it to stand up. She started walking up the stairs but fell on her knees. &ldquo;Ugh.&rdquo; She crawled up on her knees and palms like an animal. Cruton slowly got up on his knees, still shaking off his headache. &ldquo;Oh no you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He followed her and grabbed her ankle, causing her to gasp.</p></p>

<p><p>Her other foot kicked him in the face, making him fall down. Faith continued to crawl up in the same fashion. Slowly but surely, she made it to the roof. But there was no time to rest, as Cruton was always just behind her. She made to the edge of the building.</p></p>

<p><p>Cruton went up the stairs and came to the roof. &ldquo;Stay away!&rdquo; Faith yelled.</p></p>

<p><p>He stepped forward anyways. She backed away until her feet was at the edge. One more step and she&rsquo;d fall to her doom. She looked down and got scared. Cruton tried to grab her, and pulled the ribbon on her body. She tried to avoid him, and fell backwards.</p></p>

<p><p>He grabbed onto the ribbon as she fell, and it was pulled off her body. *Whip* In mere seconds, she was falling naked. Faith thought it was over and she shut her eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>*Plop* She fell into a pile of hay on the back of a wagon.</p></p>

<p><p>The farmer, still ignorant of what happened, got on the carriage and pulled the reins, causing the horses to move. The horse carriage moved towards the front gate, and the guards opened the gate, letting the carriage and the farmer leave the premises.</p></p>

<p><p>The only way into the city is to go through the road into the woods, and that&rsquo;s where the farmer led the horse carriage to. At this time of night, the streets of the capital city were deserted like a ghost town. The horse carriage stopped near the farmer&rsquo;s house, and he got off to check on the hay. As he rummaged through his cargo, he noticed it moving slightly. He was taken aback, but checked on it anyways.</p></p>

<p><p>As he removed the hay, a woman&rsquo;s face was revealed. Faith was unconscious, and she moaned a little. He was shocked that a woman would be sleeping under the hay. When did she get here? Intrigued, he removed the hay and more of her body was revealed. The farmer stared at her naked body without even blinking.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Faith came into consciousness. The first thing she saw was a bearded man giving her a perverted grin. She screamed and crawled back, covering her privates with her hands. &ldquo;Aaaah!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The farmer made a grabbing gesture with his hands. &ldquo;Come here...baby...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No! Stay away!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A rock hit him in the head. &ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; The farmer turned around and saw a young lady with long hair with a mischievous smile on her face. &ldquo;Why you!&rdquo; He got angry and attacked. Marianna punched him in the stomach, knocking him unconscious.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was surprised at the turn of events. Marianna walked over to the wagon and waved. &ldquo;Yo!&rdquo; she hollered nonchalantly.</p></p>

<p><p>It was good to see a familiar face. Faith took a deep sigh of relief. Finally, the nightmare is over, and she is safe.</p></p>


<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="e">[ E ] - The Legendary Lost City</span></p></center>


<p><p>Marianna came into Faith&rsquo;s room, bringing her a tray of food. She set it on the floor next to Faith. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought you dinner.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>There was no response from her, which bothered Marianna.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t eaten in three days. You need food to recover your strength.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo; Faith replied meekly.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna was happy to finally get a response.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sorry for worrying you. I am getting hungry. I think I will eat this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You have to cheer up, Faith.&rdquo; said Marianna. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t stay depressed forever.&rdquo; She left the room and closed the door behind her.</p></p>

<p><p>Darian approached Marianna in the hallway. &ldquo;How is she doing?&rdquo; he inquired.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s finally starting to eat, but her condition hasn&rsquo;t gotten any better.&rdquo; Marianna was staring at the ground the whole time, worried about her friend&rsquo;s health.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Darian replied. &ldquo;Perhaps I should talk to her.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I appreciate it. I don&rsquo;t know what else to do.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The door made a creaking sound as it opened, and Darian came in. Faith was sitting on the floor, with her face buried in her knees. Upon hearing the door open, Faith looked up. &ldquo;Oh, Prince Darian.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Faith, you can&rsquo;t keep sulking like this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She continued to stare the ground. &ldquo;Just leave me alone.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Marianna is worried about you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Did you come here to lecture me?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ve come here to tell you to take revenge. Are you going to let Rubeus get away with what he&rsquo;s done?&rdquo; Darian bent down to her level. &ldquo;What about your father? What will become of him?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s eyes grew wide and started shaking. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have the power to defeat Rubeus. To try is to commit suicide.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But giving up is suicide as well...on the inside.&rdquo; said Darian. &ldquo;I will never forgive the one who destroyed my kingdom. It is my quest to find him and get revenge. I suggest you think about what I said.&rdquo; With that said, he left the room.</p></p>

<p><p>Although Faith did not respond to his words, they have made an impact on her. What Darian said makes perfect sense. She was never one to give up, even if she has no chance of winning. Giving up means giving up on her father, who&rsquo;s still a prisoner of Rubeus, and giving up on her home, the palace. And worst of all, giving up on herself.</p></p>

<p><p>Thinking about all the horrible things Rubeus did to her, she grew angry.</p></p>

<p><p>As Darian walked out of the building, he saw Squire heading towards him in the opposite direction. This is the first time these two men have seen each other since Lodeus City, and they had much to say to each other. Or at least, Darian had something to say to him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you.&rdquo; said Darian as they were about to cross paths.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I am here to see the princess.&rdquo; was his simple response.</p></p>

<p><p>Normally, Darian would be annoyed at his stuck up attitude, but he had other things in mind. &ldquo;Look, I know we&rsquo;ve had our differences, but we should put that aside. We have a common enemy now.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Rubeus has committed a sin that will never be forgiven. I will defeat that sorcerer myself.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He is too powerful for any one of us to handle.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Squire did not respond to that statement, because he knows there is truth in Darian&rsquo;s words. He himself has been beaten by Rubeus, and that humiliating feeling has been stuck with him ever since. Without saying a word, Squire walked past Darian. But he stopped halfway.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;At first,&rdquo; Squire began, &ldquo;I did not trust you. But I can see you are a true friend to the princess. But mark my words, Rubeus will die by my hands.&rdquo; Squire continued to do what he came to do.</p></p>

<p><p>Darian silently acknowledged his comment and walked into the darkness of the night.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna suddenly slammed the door open, shouting &ldquo;I have it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Squire and even Faith turned to look at her strangely. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Squire.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I have it! The answers to our problems! Behold!&rdquo; She enthusiastically slammed two pieces of paper on the table.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith, who&rsquo;s a little curious, got up to take a look. &ldquo;What are these?&rdquo; she inquired.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;These are the <strong>Sacred Scrolls</strong>.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ohhh...&rdquo; said Squire.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sacred Scrolls?&rdquo; Faith repeated. &ldquo;You mean...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; Marianna replied. &ldquo;The legendary scrolls that foretell the future. I took them from the basement of the palace.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You took them? As in, you stole them?&rdquo; Faith inquired.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Details, details.&rdquo; Marianna responded, waving her hand. &ldquo;The important thing is what the scrolls say.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith, however, is still not feeling her friend&rsquo;s enthusiasm. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to rain on your parade, but how will this help us?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The scrolls say there is a legendary weapon called the <strong>Soul Swords</strong>. These twin blades hold immense power and whoever wields it can defeat even the most powerful sorcerer. That sounds like the kind of weapon we need. However, only the chosen one may use the Soul Swords. The chosen one may summon these weapons upon will, as they merge with the user&rsquo;s soul. However, to those who are not worthy, they are just plain and average swords.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How can we rely on such a silly legend? Firstly, we do not know if these swords actually exist.&rdquo; said Squire.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well. It&rsquo;s not like any one of us has the power to defeat Rubeus. Looking for this weapon is better than doing nothing.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith grew curious. &ldquo;Suppose the Soul Swords do exist...where can we find them?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;They are stored in the lost city of Arakneus.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith and Squire reacted strongly. &ldquo;Arakneus...&rdquo; Squire repeated to himself.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Arakneus, the city that was ravaged by war. It is no longer inhabited, but just a ghost city.&rdquo; Faith knows this city because she learned about it during her private lessons. She knows about its origin and significance in the kingdom&rsquo;s history, and she was told to never go there.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Very good, Faith.&rdquo; complimented Marianna. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly it. The legend says that the Soul Swords are hidden somewhere in the abandoned city.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I am against it.&rdquo; Squire spoke up first, surprising Faith, as she was about to object. &ldquo;Rumor has it that place is filled with ghosts and revengeful demons. Besides...there is nothing there. No swords, no legend, nothing but death.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better than sitting around doing nothing.&rdquo; Marianna retorted.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Purposely committing suicide is worse than doing nothing.&rdquo; Squire countered.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ohhh.&rdquo; Marianna crossed her arms. &ldquo;Squire, could it be that you&rsquo;re afraid? I suppose so, after you got beaten by Rubeus so badly.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; Squire responded angrily.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I said you&rsquo;re afraid. Like a scared-y cat.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I am afraid of nothing.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith came in between them. &ldquo;Now, now. Calm down.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What about you, Faith? Yes, the legend is only a legend, but if it&rsquo;s true, this could be our chance to become more powerful. This is the only chance you have to save your father.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith stared at the scrolls. &ldquo;I too am unsure about this. But the Sacred Scrolls would not lie. Plus, I&rsquo;ve always wanted to go on a road trip.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna&rsquo;s eyes lit up. &ldquo;Then...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to Arakneus.&rdquo; said Faith, smiling. This is the most enthusiasm she has shown in a while. After escaping the imperial palace, she has been depressed and silent this whole time. To see parts of her returning is a relief for Marianna, who was worried all this time.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna then turned to Squire. &ldquo;What about you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous.&rdquo; said he, crossing his arms. &ldquo;I am the princess&rsquo;s bodyguard! I am responsible for her safety. Where ever she goes, I go.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s settled.&rdquo; Marianna announced. &ldquo;We are going to the lost city!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ren came downstairs to the dusty basement, the place where they keep prisoners. He opened the door to the cell, and the old man looked up at him. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, your highness.&rdquo; said Ren in a sarcastic tone.</p></p>

<p><p>Midas was brought to the roof by Ren and Cruton by the arms. Rubeus was there, waiting for him. He turned around. &ldquo;Ah, your majesty. You must have gotten used to life in the prisons. I see it&rsquo;s been doing wonders for your health.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The sarcastic insults were obvious in Rubeus&rsquo;s words, as Midas has never looked worse in his life. His white hair was fuzzy and his skin was wrinkled. &ldquo;What do you want, sorcerer?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus then posed this question: &ldquo;Have you ever wondered why I wanted the imperial place so badly?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Midas looked at the ground. &ldquo;Tch. How would I know?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s simple. Because this palace is a key location for opening a portal to the demon world. It has a huge amount of spiritual energy...because of the many deaths that occurred here during the centuries.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Midas then looked up at Rubeus. &ldquo;The demon world? You don&rsquo;t mean...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes. I am going to open a portal here. The five towers of the palace will be the five corners of the devil&rsquo;s star. This building will be the center of it, the place where the portal will open. This place, which was once your home, will now be the center of a demon nest!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You...you are mad!&rdquo; shouted Midas. &ldquo;What do you hope to accomplish by doing this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Watch your manners, King Midas.&rdquo; said Cruton. &ldquo;This is a brilliant plan, Lord Rubeus.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ren also added: &ldquo;Rubeus will be the ruler of the army of demons, and he will be the king of the new world.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus then folded his hands and closed his eyes and started chanting. They can feel the spiritual energy emanating from his body. As Midas stood there, bound by ropes, he realized he was not staring at a villain with ambitions...no, but rather, a man who has gone completely insane.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Welcome to the Lost City of Arakneus!&rdquo; Marianna said, as if she&rsquo;s a tour guide.</p></p>

<p><p>At last, the party of three - Faith, Marianna, and Squire, have arrived at the lost city. Squire came reluctantly, and upon arrival, still has not changed his mind that this trip is a waste of time. Faith, on the other hand, who was secretly against coming here, was glad that she is here. Being adventurous since her childhood, she hates being confined to a single place and she likes traveling and exploring different lands.</p></p>

<p><p>Standing at the hilltop, at least 90% of the city was viewable from their point of view. From up there, the city looks promising, however, their excitement was about to be shattered and replaced with disappointment.</p></p>

<p><p>As expected, not a soul was in sight. The only things visible were ruins - buildings made of bricks, and tall stone structures like that of Stonehenge. The silence in this place is eerie, as it is different than a normal silence. There is something creepy walking through an empty city that was once inhabited by thousands.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna was the most excited one, as this is her idea. But even she felt the creepiness in the air.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So this is Arakneus, huh?&rdquo; Faith commented as they walked down the street.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s not right about this place.&rdquo; said Marianna, her eyeballs darting left and right. &ldquo;I think I can hear voices.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just your imagination.&rdquo; Squire said. &ldquo;Keep walking.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Exploring an ancient city seems exciting at first, until they actually went through it. It is quite boring, as there is nothing to do but walk around and look at old relics.</p></p>

<p><p>At the center of the city lies an old temple, and that is where the party of three was heading towards. As usual, upon arrival, they stopped to marvel at its greatness and legacy.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna, who likes acting like a tour guide, gave them a brief overview. &ldquo;This is a temple where people go to worship their many gods. The people of Arakneus had their own religion. Those who come to this holy place were said to be purified and reborn anew.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith closed her eyes. &ldquo;I can sense great spiritual energy in the temple. Although the entire city has strong spiritual energy, it is much stronger here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You are right.&rdquo; Squire commented. &ldquo;Just standing here makes me feel uncomfortable.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Little did they know, there were talismans placed on the columns to the left and right of the entrance.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; Faith said, and she walked in.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna and Squire followed suit, but they were blocked by an invisible wall. Faith turned around. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They were stumped at how Faith was able to walk through, and they cannot. They touched the wall with their hands and confirmed that there is something solid in their way.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get through!&rdquo; said Marianna.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Neither can I.&rdquo; Squire added.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous.&rdquo; Faith walked over to them, but she too was stopped by this barrier. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? Something&rsquo;s in my way!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a spiritual barrier.&rdquo; said Squire. &ldquo;There is a strong magical force protecting this temple. It is said that the priests enchanted this place with spells to prevent looters from vandalizing their treasured temple.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna then asked, &ldquo;Then how come Faith got through?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Faith replied. &ldquo;But I must do what I came to do.&rdquo; Without saying anything further, the princess turned around and walked inside the temple, towards the direction of the glittering light on the wall. The Soul Swords were placed in plain sight, elevated on the wall.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna banged on the invisible wall. &ldquo;How come Faith got through and we can&rsquo;t? This doesn&rsquo;t make sense!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose...&rdquo; Squire began.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That she could be the chosen one?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Faith? That&rsquo;s impossible!&rdquo; Marianna rejected that idea immediately. After all, she and Faith are childhood friends, and Mari knows everything about Faith. The idea that her best friend for a decade is the chosen one is silly.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;In any case, she&rsquo;s the only one who can retrieve the Soul Swords.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Even if they look like ordinary swords, Faith can feel the spiritual energy from the twin blades plastered on the wall - they are indeed the Soul Swords of legend. As she inched her way to the swords, she was in a dreamlike trance and ignored everything else. She did not notice that on her right was a stone statue, built to be two stories tall, with the face of a man.</p></p>

<p><p>As Faith walked past the stone guardian, its eyes suddenly glowed. Awakening after a few hundred years of slumber, the stone guardian began to move its dusty body. Rock chunks fell to the ground as it stood up.</p></p>

<p><p>Hearing the rumbling, Faith turned to the side and saw the statue moving. She screamed in surprise and watched in suspense as the guardian stood up on its feet.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Faith!!&rdquo; screamed Marianna.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Princess!&rdquo; screamed Squire.</p></p>

<p><p>They watched helpless as their friend is facing great danger.</p></p>


<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="f">[ F ] - Get the Legendary Weapons</span></p></center>


<p><p>Faith stepped back as the guardian slowly inched its way towards her. Its eyes glowed and it moved its right arm. Its fingers clenched into a fist and pounded the ground, and Faith jumped away. *Bam*</p></p>

<p><p>The statue pounded its left hand into the ground, aiming for Faith, but she was faster and jumped away in time.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna pounded her fist on the invisible wall. &ldquo;Faith! No!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Unfortunately, her words fell to death ears. The statue pounded the ground, and Faith swings her sword on its wrist. *Clunk* Nothing happened. She was shocked. The guardian swings its arm to the side, knocking Faith against a column. *Wham* Then she fell on the ground face flat.</p></p>

<p><p> Squire exclaimed: &ldquo;Damn! If only we can get inside!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to find another way in. If not she&rsquo;s toast!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was nearly knocked out cold with that attack. The guardian&rsquo;s feet stomped the ground, which made her wake up. *Stomp stomp*</p></p>

<p><p>She stood up, despite all the pain in her back. &ldquo;Of course swords don&rsquo;t work on you. How about this?&rdquo; She put her palms together and stuck out her forefinger, turning her hand into a gun. &ldquo;Energy Shot!&rdquo; She fired a laser from the tip of her finger and the guardian crossed its arms over its head. *Kaboom* That also failed.</p></p>

<p><p>The guardian punched the column, while Faith rolled to the side. *Crumble* The column fell apart. Faith saw the Soul Swords from the corner of her eye, and she realized it&rsquo;s her last resort. She ran towards the wall and touched one of the sword&rsquo;s bottom. Upon contact with the sacred object, a bright light hit her face. *Flash*</p></p>

<p><p>Faith found herself inside a different realm, a place with nothing but rocks and the clear blue sky. This is known as the spirit world. &ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; she asked nobody.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You are in the spirit world now. That means you are the chosen one.&rdquo; said a ghastly voice.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith became startled. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Two spirits appeared in the form of a man and a woman in old age clothing.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Are you ghosts?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo; Forcis replied. &ldquo;We are the spirits of the Soul Swords. I am Forcis, and this is Lana.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith gasped. &ldquo;That means you&rsquo;re the guardian spirits of the Soul Swords?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s correct. You are able to see us because the swords have chosen you, princess.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Princess? You know who I am?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lana: &ldquo;From the moment you touched the swords, we read your mind and we know everything about you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean you have chosen me? I&rsquo;m so confused.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lana: &ldquo;Not just anyone can wield the Soul Swords. We the spirits decide who is worthy to wield the legendary weapons. And the fact that you are here in the Lost City means it was meant to be.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Meant to be? As in fate?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Forcis: &ldquo;Perhaps. Fate is something beyond our comprehension. When it happens to us we must accept it. You might be lost now, princess, but I see great things for you in the future.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lana: &ldquo;Our souls will become one with your soul and you can summon the Soul Swords using your will. Good luck to you, Faith Midas.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The two spirits vanished. &ldquo;No wait!&rdquo; Faith yelled. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand! Don&rsquo;t leave!&rdquo; The spirit world started to crumble and fizzle away. ..</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Faith found herself back at the ancient temple. She looked at the wall and the Soul Swords were no where in sight. The guardian was approaching her. Two minutes have passed in the spirit world, but in reality not even a second has passed. The guardian smashed its fist into the ground, and Faith jumped back. *Smash*</p></p>

<p><p>She thought about what the female spirit said to her. Our souls will become one with your soul and you can summon the Soul Swords using your will. (Summon them using my will?)</p></p>

<p><p>Faith closed her eyes and concentrated hard and the Soul Swords appeared in her left and right hand. To her surprise, it actually works.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna and Squire were shocked to see what happened.</p></p>

<p><p>But there was no time to celebrate or figure out how it works, for her life is still in mortal danger.</p></p>

<p><p>The guardian combined its fists into one and slammed the ground like a jackhammer. *Wham* Faith rolled away just in time.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna pounded her fists on the invisible wall. &ldquo;Faith, I know you can do it! You of all people can do this! Take down that overgrown piece of stone!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith took a deep breath and stared at the enemy. At first, the size of the enemy looks threatening and its power is overwhelming, but for some reason, holding the swords in her hand gives her a sense of confidence. It&rsquo;s as if she can feel the power of the swords without even using them. Her ultimate goal is to get revenge on Rubeus, and to do that, she must take down this enemy. It&rsquo;s just the first of many hurdles she must overcome to become strong.</p></p>

<p><p>She put her ki into the blades and they were glowing. Faith slashed forward and the shockwaves created from the blades formed an X and hit the statue. The statue crossed its arms over its head to block. The only damage was a minor scratch.</p></p>

<p><p>The guardian continued its advance and tried to punch her. Faith blurred and appeared from the side. She combined the two Soul Swords into one more powerful Soul Sword. She swings the blade and its shockwave cut off its left arm. *Crumble*</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna: &ldquo;She did it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Squire: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s grown quite powerful.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The statue continued its advance as if nothing happened. Faith swings the blade horizontally and the resulting shockwave cut off its legs, and it fell down face flat. *Smash*</p></p>

<p><p>The statue reached for her with its right arm, the only limb intact. Even though its face is the same, the statue looked angry and it was in pain.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith noticed a shiny gem on its forehead, and she realized this is its weakness. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s over.&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been guarding this temple for hundreds, maybe even a thousand years, protecting the legendary swords. Your role is over and it&rsquo;s time to take a nap...forever.&rdquo; Faith ran forward and jumped over its right arm and headed directly for the gem. *Crack* She hit the blade against the gem and it cracked into a million pieces. The statue ceased to move and became a lifeless statue once again.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith breathed hard and the Soul Swords vanished into thin air.</p></p>

<p><p> The spiritual boundary disappeared and Squire walked forward. &ldquo;Look, Marianna. We can go in.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna and Squire ran towards Faith to congratulate her. &ldquo;Faith, you did it!&rdquo; She grabbed Faith&rsquo;s shoulders and shook her.</p></p>

<p><p>Squire: &ldquo;How did you learn how to use the Soul Swords?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure. But the spirits guided me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The spirits?&rdquo; Squire did not understand what she meant.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s become a part of me now.&rdquo; she said. Then she demonstrated by holding out her hand and closed her eyes for a second. By concentrating really hard, the Soul Sword appeared in her palm.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna was impressed by this magic. &ldquo;Whoa. How did you do that?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to explain...we can talk about this later.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> Faith led her friends outside of the Lost City and into the dark forest. It was nighttime and crickets are heard. Faith summoned the Soul Swords into her palms and held one of them high. &ldquo;Spirits of the Soul Sword...I call upon thee.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Her companions waited anxiously and the spirits Lana and Forcis appeared moments later.</p></p>

<p><p>Forcis: &ldquo;Congratulations on your victory, princess.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mari: &ldquo;Whoa! They can talk!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Squire: &ldquo;Are you the guardians of the Soul Swords?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lana: &ldquo;We have been guarding the Soul Swords for the past 800 years.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Everyone was shocked by that.</p></p>

<p><p>Lana: &ldquo;We know everything about you, Marianna, Squire. You want to defeat the sorcerer named Rubeus, do you not?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s taken over the palace and his power is too much for us to handle. How can I defeat him?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lana: &ldquo;You need to get stronger and develop skills you&rsquo;ve never had before. Even having the Soul Swords at your disposal is not enough. I will teach you all how to fly.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Everyone gasped.</p></p>

<p><p>Mari: &ldquo;How to fly?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Forcis: &ldquo;Rubeus has completely mastered control over his ki and he can fly. To fight him evenly you must learn how to fly.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna: &ldquo;Is that possible...I mean, for us?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lana: &ldquo;It will be difficult, but I believe you can do it. You are the chosen ones. As long as you wield the Soul Swords, this is within the realm of possibility.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith and Marianna and Squire looked at each other with happy faces. They were ecstatic like excited children about to receive a wonderful gift.</p></p>

<p><p>At the break of dawn, the party of three began their training under Lana&rsquo;s tutelage. As she is only a spirit, she can only instruct them through her words. Marianna, Faith, and Squire stood in a straight line and awaited their teacher&rsquo;s instructions.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The key to conquering the skies is to channel the ki in your body into your feet. By doing that, you will begin floating, and eventually fly. It will take some getting used to, but you will get used to it. Now, focus on your ki. Visualize it in your mind. Visualize the energy flowing into your legs and under your feet. Now relax.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The students did just as Lana said, but they were having a hard time. They have never done anything like this before. The entire body has ki, but the body has many parts, and to gather all of it into one spot is quite difficult.</p></p>

<p><p>Squire&rsquo;s eyes twitched as he struggled to control his ki.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Just relax.&rdquo; Lana continued. &ldquo;Channel the ki in your body.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>But the students could do anything but relax. Out of the three, Marianna was having the most trouble of all. All this ki usage was draining her body&rsquo;s strength, and suddenly, she just fell down. *Thud* She panted for breath. &ldquo;No...this is too hard.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Squire grunted in pain, but he persevered. Seconds later, just like Marianna, he fell down.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was the last one standing, but she too was struggling with her ki control. Eventually, she fell down too. &ldquo;This...this is impossible.&rdquo; she mumbled.</p></p>

<p><p>Lana sighed in disappointment. &ldquo;This is only the first day, after all. It&rsquo;s going to take some time.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>In the next class, Forcis teaches them how to handle their ki. Marianna, Faith and Squire sit on the ground in meditation position, cross-legged, eyes closed, and hands over their knees.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now close your eyes and try to empty your mind. Feel the ki flow throughout your body. Feel it in your spine, your bones, your muscles, every inch of your body. Channel that ki and harness it by focusing on it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>As he spoke, the three students gathered ki into their bodies just as he instructed. They are fighters at heart, and therefore not used to sitting around like this. Marianna was sweating heavily as she struggled to keep her ki in check. Her body became drained and she can no longer handle it, and fell forward on her palms. She looked over to Faith and Squire and wondered how it&rsquo;s possible they can still do this.</p></p>

<p><p>Being a soldier from birth, Squire is a bit more disciplined than the others. However, his impatience is his major weakness. Unable to control all the ki in his body, it all escaped into the air, and he fell backwards. &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith continued to meditate, ignoring everything around her. Her ki was expanding rapidly and Marianna and Squire watched with curious eyes. Forcis was also in suspense. But the ki was too much for her young body to handle, and she lost control and her ki escaped from her body, and she opened her eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>Forcis had just a sliver of hope, and now it&rsquo;s gone. He sighed in disappointment. &ldquo;They might be too young for this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>By nightfall, everyone was sound asleep, except that no one was sleeping. One by one, they snuck away from the campfire to be alone in the woods. It was a frustrating day, to say the least, since no one made any progress.</p></p>

<p><p>Mari practiced archery. *Twang* Her arrow hit the tree at the exact spot she wanted. This is the one thing she&rsquo;s good at and comfortable at. Yet it&rsquo;s not enough if she wants to get stronger. For some reason, she&rsquo;s bad at controlling her ki. Even though her aim is always accurate, it does not make her happy right now. She wonders what&rsquo;s wrong with her...and more importantly, how can she help her best friend Faith in her dire time of need.</p></p>

<p><p>Squire punched the tree, causing a dent in it. He was grunting angrily as he pretended that Rubeus&rsquo;s face is on the tree. He&rsquo;ll never forget how he was defeated by Rubeus...and his pride will never allow him to sleep easy, knowing that he failed the princess, and more importantly, he failed himself.</p></p>

<p><p>Once they were both finished, Squire fired first, and Rubeus second. The two beams hit each other at the midpoint between the two fighters. *Froom* Their powers were even and the beams were unable to push each other. At the collision point, there was so much energy that any person standing there would be vaporized instantly.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Rubeus used a new trick that he learned. His eyes glowed a ghastly white color, a white that is much brighter than Squire&rsquo;s hair. As a result, Squire found himself unable to move. (What!? My body isn&rsquo;t responding!)</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus&rsquo;s purple beam pushed Squire&rsquo;s white beam further down until it hit Squire, knocking him against the golden statue. *Wham*</p></p>

<p><p>That was a critical hit, one that even Squire cannot recover from. He crawled forward a little, but he cannot stand on his feet anymore. Not even having the time to figure out why his body won&rsquo;t move at that crucial time, he groaned in pain, as he suffered a humiliating defeat, and fell unconscious on the concrete.</p></p>

<p><p>During the fight, he wasn&rsquo;t able to think clearly, but now he can. Rubeus must have learned a new spell that made him not able to move. Still, Squire cursed his own weakness and punched the tree even harder, nearly breaking it.</p></p>

<p><p>Squire&rsquo;s anger and frustration was a mutual feeling. *Clank* Faith slammed the Soul Sword into a tree. She was angry over the humiliation that Rubeus put her through. Not only can she not save her father, but she couldn&rsquo;t save herself.</p></p>

<p><p>Lana appeared in front of the tree, startling Faith a little. &ldquo;I understand you are angry, but the tree did nothing to you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How can I defeat Rubeus? I need more power...desperately. But I don&rsquo;t know how.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You remind me a lot of myself.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith gasped and looked at the spirit&rsquo;s face.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Forcis and I were once human before we died...around 800 years ago. We were lovers destined to be together. Everyday we spent together was a blessing and we took it for granted. There was this evil sorcerer who was jealous of our relationship and jealous of Forcis&rsquo;s power. His name was <strong>Reaver</strong>. Him and Forcis had a showdown, but Forcis lost...and he cursed us. Our souls would be trapped inside the Soul Swords for all eternity, never to be freed. Since the day we died, we have been waiting for someone to claim the Soul Swords...Rubeus reminds me of Reaver.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry...I had no idea.&rdquo; Faith responded. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want my generation to end up like the past. That is why I have to learn to fly as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You do not learn by rushing.&rdquo; Lana replied. &ldquo;You learn by getting better at controlling your ki, and this takes time.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Time is something I do not have the luxury of! Rubeus is going to open a portal to the demon world. Time is of the essence.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Princess, I guarantee you that if you take on Rubeus the way you are now, you are committing suicide. The first step to flying is to let go of your guilt...your shame...these heavy feelings hold you down. I know what you are going through. I am woman too. But rushing your training will lead to your death, and you will not save anyone.&rdquo; With that said, Lana disappeared.</p></p>

<p><p>Lana is gone, but her words still remained in the silence of the night. Faith knows that Lana is right, but it&rsquo;s still painful not be able to do anything to save her father. It sucks to know that you&rsquo;re weak and you can&rsquo;t fight back.</p></p>

<p><p>The next morning, class was in session yet again. Lana, the instructor, gave her students instructions. &ldquo;Focus on your ki and control it with your mind...let it flow throughout your body and to the bottom of your feet. Clear your mind of any thoughts...any doubts.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith, Marianna, and Squire tried really hard, but still were unable to float. Today, however, something was different about Faith. She seemed more relaxed than usual, perhaps due to her pep talk with Lana last night. Her mind is clear and she was into her body. The ki started to flow out of her limbs and the sand around her floated up in a circle.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna stopped for a moment to look at her friend, and she was shocked to see that Faith&rsquo;s toes are not touching the ground. She nudged Squire, who now was staring at Faith. Her feet were inches off the ground, and they floated higher and higher.</p></p>

<p><p>Lana was impressed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing good! Keep concentrating on your energy. But always be relaxed.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was elevated nearly half a foot off the ground before she landed. &ldquo;I...I did it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna and Squire went to her side. &ldquo;You did it! I knew you had the potential!&rdquo; said Mari.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Good job, princess.&rdquo; said Squire.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Congratulations, princess.&rdquo; said Lana. &ldquo;But this is only the beginning.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith nodded, and the three students went back to their positions and continued their training.</p></p>

<p><p>Now that they have a renewed sense of motivation, all three of them trained like hell. By afternoon time, all three of them can float. Marianna opened her eyes and she was laughing like a little kid. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing it too!&rdquo; Squire announced.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all doing great!&rdquo; Faith said.</p></p>

<p><p>All three of them landed and gave each other high fives.</p></p>

<p><p>Lana smiled as this is the first time she&rsquo;s been happy in hundreds of years. &ldquo;You are all doing very well. If you continue to work hard, you can fly in a short time.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Little did they know, Darian was watching them from afar. He was far away enough to be hidden, but close enough to read their lips and thus their dialogue. &ldquo;So that is how humans can learn to fly. I&rsquo;m going to learn as well...maybe this will help me get powerful enough to defeat Vega.&rdquo;</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="g">[ G ] - The Sky is the Limit
</span></p></center>

<p><p>On the roof of the castle he took over, Rubeus was chanting something.</p></p>

<p><p>Behind him, King Midas was bound to one of the castle&rsquo;s columns. &ldquo;What are you planning? Are you opening a portal to the demon world?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus stopped chanting as he just finished. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in charge now, your majesty. You have no say anymore.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Stop this, I beg of you. You&rsquo;re going to ruin everything!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The portal, which is the black hole that was opened, grew bigger. &ldquo;Do you know why I must open the portal on this castle? You have no idea what this place is, do you? In the Kingdom of Almerak, there are certain places that have high spiritual energy. Five points on the map have extremely high spiritual energy, forming the <strong>devil&rsquo;s star</strong>.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The devil&rsquo;s star?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I have already secured the other four points on the star. The last point is this very place, your castle! Once all five points have portals opened and the portals have reached a certain size, they will remain open permanently.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Midas was shocked. &ldquo;You mean to overrun our world with those vile demonic creatures? You are mad!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late. The process has started.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What about my daughter? What have you done with her?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Rest assured...she&rsquo;s still alive and well. I&rsquo;ll take good care of her. As long as you don&rsquo;t try anything, I will not kill her.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>In the next lesson, Faith, Marianna and Squire sat facing each other in lotus position. The spirit Forcis just gave them instructions and now they are ready for the good part of the lesson. Their eyes were shut tightly, their minds were clear, and their bodies were relaxed. This time, unlike the other time, they will succeed because they have the belief and the discipline.</p></p>

<p><p>As they meditated, their ki grew bigger and bigger, surrounding their bodies like a dome. Their energy domes grew bigger until they touched each other&rsquo;s.</p></p>

<p><p>Forcis was surprised at their progress, especially Faith&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Impressive. They are learning faster than I anticipated.&rdquo; His view of them was completely different than their first day of training. The difference is like night and day.</p></p>

<p><p>And so, in the same fashion, the heroes trained like this for a week. They&rsquo;ve improved day after day. Meanwhile, Darin trained by himself in the woods.</p></p>

<p><p>Today the weather was particularly good - the sun was brighter and the wind felt good - much better than the other days. Lana gave them their final instructions. &ldquo;You have all worked hard and trained your very best. Today is the day you put your skills to the test. Whether you fly or drop is up to you. Good luck, warriors. I have faith in you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Squire, Faith, and Marianna closed their eyes and focused on their ki. Clearing their mind is hard for these youngsters...who were full of doubt, anger, and worry. This is particularly true for Faith, the most troubled one of all. She did not know how to handle being called the &ldquo;chosen one&rdquo; - she just wants to be a normal girl like everyone else. But in order to fly, she will do whatever it takes, including changing her mindset.</p></p>

<p><p>She channeled her ki from her body down to her feet. Then she floated up while her eyes were still closed. Although she can&rsquo;t see, Faith can feel herself floating higher and higher up. The air is brushing her face and she can tell how high up she is.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, she opened her eyes at the same time as Mari and Squire. They were all high up. The girls gasped and they were absolutely delighted.</p></p>

<p><p>Mari: &ldquo;Look Faith! We&rsquo;re flying!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I know! Ain&rsquo;t this wonderful?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They held each other hands and spun in the air. Squire was also having fun. &ldquo;This is fantastic! All the training was worth it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith and Mari let go of each other and they fly around in circles. Faith flew above the trees and remain floated in the sky. She took a deep breath and absorbed everything. She felt the sun hit her face, the breeze against her skin, and the calmness of the sky. This is a view that she&rsquo;s never seen before...and nature looks beautiful from this height.</p></p>

<p><p>After much celebrating and flying around, the students ran out of ki and landed on the ground.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You guys did it, I&rsquo;m very proud of you!&rdquo; Lana exclaimed.</p></p>

<p><p>Forcis appeared. &ldquo;All your training has led up to this very moment. You have worked hard and now you have become stronger than before.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The students looked at each other and smiled.</p></p>

<p><p>The spirits then turned to Faith. &ldquo;Especially you, princess. You have shown us why you are the chosen one. We are honored to have you as our master. Now, summon the Soul Swords.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith proceeded to call upon the Soul Swords with her spirit, and they appeared in her grip.</p></p>

<p><p>Lana: &ldquo;Remember, we will always be with you. You are never alone.&rdquo; The spirits vanished into the swords.</p></p>

<p><p>Mari touched Faith on the shoulder. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith nodded. &ldquo;Mmm. We have to reclaim what&rsquo;s ours from Rubeus.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>During the darkest part of the night, three hooded warriors approached the front gates of the castle. The two guards crossed their spears, making an X. &ldquo;Hold it. Identify yourself.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I enter my own home?&rdquo; said Faith.</p></p>

<p><p>The guards recognize her voice. Then Faith took off the hood and robe. Then Marianna and Squire threw their robes away. The guards were shocked. &ldquo;Ah...princess!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My apologies...&rdquo; said Guard B. &ldquo;But Rubeus is here. You&rsquo;re in danger.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright.&rdquo; Faith said, placing her hand on his spear. &ldquo;I came to confront him.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The two guards stared at her, then at each other, and placed their spears vertically into the ground. &ldquo;Welcome home, princess.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The front gates opened slowly, making a creaking sound. *Creeeek* Faith and others walked in, feeling stronger than ever.</p></p>

<p><p>A soldier whispered into Arkady&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;What? I did not authorize the front gate to be opened. I will check it myself.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Cruton and Ren were playing cards. &ldquo;Is something the matter?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo; Arkady replied, leaving the room. He went to the balcony, confused and displeased. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? I demand someone tell me now!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A soldier walked up to him. &ldquo;Sir, I don&rsquo;t know why the gate is opening!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady grabbed him by the collar and pulled him forward. &ldquo;Well find out! If not someone&rsquo;s going to be demon meat!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>*Kaboom* An explosion occurred on the ground. Arkady winced from the dust. &ldquo;What the hell!?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Everyone heard the explosion and felt the shaking. Rubeus was meditating and his eyes opened in shock.</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady stood in front of the cloud of smoke. &ldquo;Who dares defy us?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith, Squire, and Marianna came out from the smoke. &ldquo;This is my home.&rdquo; said Faith. She was holding one of the Soul Swords.</p></p>

<p><p>This was the first time Arkady felt fear seeing the princess. There&rsquo;s something different about her tonight. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you, the princess.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mari stepped forward. &ldquo;This one&rsquo;s mine. You go ahead.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Alright. I entrust this to you.&rdquo; Faith answered. She and Squire dashed past Arkady at a speed that he&rsquo;s never seen before. *Froom!* They were so fast that they made their own hurricanes, blowing all the dust away in their path.</p></p>

<p><p>Cruton jumped down from the balcony. &ldquo;Hold it. It&rsquo;s you...&rdquo; he said, surprised to see Faith.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith stepped forward, but Squire put his arm in front of her. &ldquo;This one is mine.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the chosen one.&rdquo; said Squire. &ldquo;The Soul Swords chose you. So you are the one most fit to fight Rubeus.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith nodded and went ahead. She dashed forward, going past Cruton like a sports car.</p></p>

<p><p>Squire cracked his knuckles and Cruton cracked his neck. Both fighters prepare themselves for a showdown.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna and Arkady shoot arrows at each other while running sideways. As the arrow headed towards her face, she ducked, then quickly loaded an arrow into her bow and released it. They stopped running and kept shooting and their arrows collided with each other at the center.</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady: &ldquo;It seems that we are evenly matched. Our special moves will determine the match.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Agreed. You&rsquo;ll soon see the fruits of my training.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been slacking off either, you know?&rdquo; Arkady loaded three arrows into his bow. &ldquo;Demonic Arrow!&rdquo; He fired all three at once and they were glowing red.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna shot the Celestial Arrow and destroys one of Arkady&rsquo;s red arrows and flew past his shoulder, scraping it. The other two red arrows headed straight for her, she dodged one of them, but the other scraped her right arm.</p></p>


<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="h">[ H ] - Become the Chosen One!</span></p></center>

<p><p>Faith jumped up all the way to the top of the castle. Ren appeared in front of her. They did the stare and she got into fighting position. Suddenly, they hear the sound of a flute playing. Prince Darian was standing on the top of the north tower. &ldquo;Prince Darian!&rdquo; Faith exclaimed.</p></p>

<p><p>Ren was annoyed. &ldquo;Tch. Great, another interference.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darian flew to their roof.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith: &ldquo;You can fly too?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darian: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been taking lessons of my own. It&rsquo;s a long story. I&rsquo;ll handle this guy. You go ahead.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; Faith went on her way.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus finished chanting something. The portal in front of him was about the size of a doorway. It&rsquo;s big enough, so he leaves it be. Midas was still tied up to the wall.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s over, your highness. Oh, by the way, these demons are bloodthirsty. As soon as they see you, well...I don&rsquo;t want to get into details.&rdquo; Rubeus then walked away.</p></p>

<p><p>Midas feared for his life. Just now, he felt a ki unlike any other, yet very familiar. &ldquo;No. It can&rsquo;t be her...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady pointed his bow up and shot 3 arrows into the air. Marianna fired the Celestial Arrow into the air. Her special move has been upgraded - she can control the arrow with her mind. To control it, she closed her eyes and focused her ki on the arrow.</p></p>

<p><p>The three red arrows came hurling down. The blue arrow curved to the side and curled horizontally, hitting the three red arrows.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo; exclaimed Arkady.</p></p>

<p><p>The blue arrow came for him, and he ducked, and it went past him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mine.&rdquo; Arkady loaded three arrows into his bow and aimed at Marianna.</p></p>

<p><p>Her eyes were still closed and she&rsquo;s defenseless in this state. This is the perfect time to strike, so he thought. The blue arrow flew into the trees but made a U-turn in the opposite direction. It came back and hit Arkady&rsquo;s back. The pain came as a shock and his eyes grew wide open. He turned around to look at the piece of wood plunged into his back.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be...&rdquo; He dropped his bow, then he himself dropped down.</p></p>

<p><p>Squire is about to have the fight of his life...all his training was for this moment. &ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Cruton smiled. &ldquo;So you came back after being whipped like a dog. As I recall, Rubeus pounded you good.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m warning you, don&rsquo;t underestimate me. I&rsquo;m not the same as before.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Then show me what you&rsquo;ve got!&rdquo; Cruton used his mind to make some energy balls appear out of thin air. This move is almost the same as Rubeus&rsquo;s. The balls fly towards Squire, who ran to the side. *Bam bam bam*</p></p>

<p><p>One ball hit the ground in front of Squire, and he rolled on the ground and ended up crouching. Squire fired a beam and Cruton blocked it with his shield.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I admit, you&rsquo;ve gotten stronger.&rdquo; said Cruton.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I told you.&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Too bad Rubeus was the one who defeated me, not you. And he&rsquo;s not here to save you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Cruton laughed. &ldquo;Even without him, I can still take you down with my bare hands.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Cruton formed more energy balls, twice as much as last time. There must be at least 20 of them floating around. Squire panicked and ran away as the balls chased him. Cruton can also alter their speed as well as direction. Some of the balls got in front of Squire. He stopped running and turned around, only to see balls in the opposite direction. Seconds later, he was surrounded by balls in every direction, even from above.</p></p>

<p><p>Cruton: &ldquo;I got you! It&rsquo;s over!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Crap!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The balls all flew to Squire and exploded. *Kaboom* He screamed in agony as the balls kept hitting him and exploding against his body.</p></p>

<p><p>Squire fell down face flat. His clothes have burn marks and his white cape had holes in it.</p></p>

<p><p>Darian played the flute causing Ren&rsquo;s ears to hurt. He covered his ears with his hand but it didn&rsquo;t help. &ldquo;Ugh not this blasted thing!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Shutting your ears won&rsquo;t help you.&rdquo; said Darian in between the tones.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh...in that case I&rsquo;ll have to remove it from you!&rdquo; Ren used the Power Wave on the floor, causing it break apart all the way to where Darian was standing. *Crrrassh*</p></p>

<p><p>The castle&rsquo;s pavement fell apart, and Darian was knocked down. The flute fell into the cracks.</p></p>

<p><p>Ren crossed his arms. &ldquo;Without the flute, you&rsquo;re toast.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darian stood up. &ldquo;Hmph. I don&rsquo;t need the flute to beat the likes of you.&rdquo; He drew his sword.</p></p>

<p><p>Ren cocked his eyebrow while smiling. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They charged into each other - Ren did the Power Punch, breaking the blade into pieces, and of the pieces cut Darian&rsquo;s cheek.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Are you out of toys yet?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darian touched his cheek and saw blood in his fingers. &ldquo;Fine then. I&rsquo;ll take you on with my bare fists.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh if you want a contest of brute strength, you&rsquo;re making a big mistake, mister.&rdquo; Ren cracked his knuckles.</p></p>

<p><p>The two fighters ran into each other and let out a fury of punches and blocks. Then they grab each other&rsquo;s hands and tested their strength against each others. They grunted and popped veins as they put all their energy into it.</p></p>

<p><p>Ren, being slightly stronger than Darian, overpowered him. He pulled Darian forward, forcing him to lower his body. Then he kneed him in the chin. *Wham* Then he whacked Darin on the back, causing him to fall down. Ren kicked him in the stomach, shoving him to the edge of the roof.</p></p>

<p><p>After taking a critical hit, Squire was down for the count. Cruton raised his left arm and Squire floated to the air. &ldquo;Now, for the finishing move...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Energy balls appeared near Cruton&rsquo;s head. He made the balls grow bigger by giving them more ki.</p></p>

<p><p>Squire opened his eyes and moaned. He was at the end of the rope and only moments away from death. He has to do something fast, or he&rsquo;s good as toast. He thought about all his training - all the hard work he put in to become stronger - he didn&rsquo;t do all that just to lose here.</p></p>

<p><p>With a renewed sense of motivation, he floated up vertically and powered up. Cruton threw the balls at him. Squire screamed and his shield destroyed the balls. *Kaboom-boom-boom!*</p></p>

<p><p>Cruton was shocked at the turn of events. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible...how did he improve so much in such a short time?&rdquo; He grew angry and floated up to his enemy&rsquo;s altitude. He powered up.</p></p>

<p><p>The two fighters did the stare. Then they flew into each other and hit like crazy. *Wham wham wham* Then they backed away.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You die now!&rdquo; Cruton formed balls in front of him and made them big balls.</p></p>

<p><p>Squire fired a white beam, it was concentrated with all his ki. It went through the balls, causing them to explode, and hit Cruton. &ldquo;No...no...aaaaah!&rdquo; The beam struck his stomach and pushed him all the way to the wall. *Thud*</p></p>

<p><p>He fell to ground face flat. *Splat*</p></p>

<p><p>Squire landed and he panted for breath. He put everything he had into that last attack. Cruton got back on his palms and knees and stood up. This is bad news for Squire and right now, he has no idea if he can still win this fight. Cruton then fell forward. *Splat*</p></p>

<p><p>The fallen Darian coughed and panted for breath. Ren walked over to him. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re Prince Darian of Zaibach. I heard about the tragedy that occurred...Zaibach doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darin looked up. &ldquo;What would you know? You weren&rsquo;t there...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh. This is good. We&rsquo;ve got a prince of a kingdom that doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore. You&rsquo;re not a prince. You have no title and no home. Nothing but a nomad.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darian was angry and he stood up, surprising Ren. &ldquo;The one who destroyed Zaibach is a tyrant more horrible and evil than your master. And I&rsquo;m going to find him and kill him! But before that...I&rsquo;m going to save this kingdom. I&rsquo;m not going to let Rubeus ruin it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;In your dreams, pal!&rdquo; Ren used the Power Wave.</p></p>

<p><p>Darian screamed and formed a shield using his remaining ki. &ldquo;Aaaaaaah!&rdquo; The ground was destroyed except for the part he was standing on.</p></p>

<p><p>Ren threw a beam forward and Darian walked directly into it. His body was charged up with ki and he&rsquo;s angrier and more violent than before, and he did not care about the consequences. He pushed his way into the beam and it went through him like hot air.</p></p>

<p><p>Ren grew nervous and decided it&rsquo;s time to switch tactics. He flew up. Darian flew up as well. They flew around and hit each other. *Wham wham wham*</p></p>

<p><p>Both fighters landed facing away from each other. Darian was hit in the chest and he coughed blood. Ren laughed. &ldquo;Ha ha ha!&rdquo; Suddenly, he felt pain and looked down. He was hit three times - the chest, the stomach and his right leg. His pupils dilated and he collapsed.</p></p>

<p><p>The silver-haired sorcerer stood at the edge of the balcony, staring at the night sky and sensing the battles happening the below. Suddenly, he felt a ki behind him. Faith showed up, and he turned around. The two did the stare for a while. These two have a long history and seeing each other brings up many emotions, especially for Faith. She has been through a lot and she trained a long time for this very day.</p></p>

<p><p>Even though no words have been said yet, there was so much tension a fly could have died flying between them.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s you princess. You decided to come back.&rdquo; said Rubeus. &ldquo;Knowing you, it can only mean one thing.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come back for your head!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You come back to die! You seem to have forgotten what happened last time? Let me remind you.&rdquo; Rubeus floated up.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith floated up to his altitude, surprising Rubeus.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You can fly too?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been training for this day.&rdquo; she said.</p></p>

<p><p>He grinned. &ldquo;I see. You came prepared. But you&rsquo;re a hundred years too young to even think about fighting me.&rdquo; His eyes glowed. This is the freezing spell that he used before to paralyze her body.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith closed her eyes. Rubeus wondered if it worked. Faith&rsquo;s eyes opened. &ldquo;I can see through your spell. It requires eye contact. As long as I don&rsquo;t look into your eyes, it won&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Now that the cat&rsquo;s out of the bag, Rubeus grunted. This alone is a victory for our heroine. Before, she wasn&rsquo;t thinking clearly because of fear and intimidation. But now she&rsquo;s calmer and thinking clearly. Looking back, when Forcis forced her to meditate, it was to prepare for moments like these.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmph. So you&rsquo;ve gotten a little smarter too. But what about your spirit power?&rdquo; Rubeus formed a bunch of energy balls in front of him. Three of the balls flew at her.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith knocked those balls away with her sword. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t just come here after learning some new skills. I&rsquo;m a completely different person than before. It&rsquo;s best if you don&rsquo;t underestimate me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Grrrr. I&rsquo;m in charge now and I&rsquo;ll make you sure you understand that!&rdquo; Rubeus threw all the balls in her direction.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith summoned the second Soul Sword into her left hand. Wielding both Soul Swords, she blocked all thirteen balls.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus gasped. &ldquo;Those swords...I&rsquo;ve heard about them...the legendary swords that hold tremendous power. How did you come into possession of them?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure myself, but the swords chose me!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What rubbish! I&rsquo;ll teach you a lesson you&rsquo;ll never forget.&rdquo; Rubeus decided it&rsquo;s time to get serious. His body glowed a purple color, which means his ki is rising.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith also got serious. She put the butts of the swords together, combining them into a longer, double edged sword.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus gathered his ki and fired a beam. Faith started spinning the blades like a fan, except much faster and deadlier. The beam hit the fan and disintegrated. By constantly spinning the swords, she can protect herself from any attacks from the front. This move is called <strong>Whirlwind</strong>.</p></p>

<p><p>This motion also generated enough wind to push Rubeus back. He crossed his arms over his eyes and can&rsquo;t concentrate on attacking. &ldquo;Ugh...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Then Faith threw the blades like a boomerang. This attack is called the <strong>Whirlwind Disk</strong>. Touching it would be fatal, so Rubeus dodged to the side. The boomerang came back to its owner&rsquo;s hand.</p></p>

<p><p>For her next attack, Faith separated the Soul Swords and pointed both blades sideways. Her body started spinning like a top, and soon became a tornado with blades. She pointed both blades upwards and it became a spinning needle of death. Rubeus threw a bunch of balls at it, and the spinning needle went through the balls like they were nothing. This is her <strong>Spin Dive Needle</strong> technique.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus dodged it by a hair&rsquo;s length. She crashed into a column, destroying it completely. Rubeus realized that his arm was scratched, despite having dodged it. What a deadly move, he thought. Even the air pressure can cut him.</p></p>

<p><p>The dust cleared and the smoke settled, and Faith walked out unscathed.</p></p>

<p><p>The dimensional portal is an elliptical black hole that hung in the air. Inside of it is nothing but pitch darkness, nothing that can be seen with the human eye. Midas was bound to the column by tight ropes. His couldn&rsquo;t avert his eyes away from the black portal. Suddenly, he felt something sinister coming out from the other side.</p></p>

<p><p>A red claw grabbed the side of the portal. A red demon came crawling out, hungry and drooling. Moments later, more demons crawled out, some species of which he&rsquo;s never seen before. &ldquo;No...this can&rsquo;t be.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The red demon smelled blood and noticed Midas and crawled towards him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...stay back. Stay back demon!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith pointed her right sword at him. &ldquo;This is the end of the, Rubeus. This is my home and I&rsquo;m taking it back.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh. You&rsquo;re taking that tone with me just because you got a little stronger? You should&rsquo;ve obeyed me like a good girl. Now I&rsquo;m going to punish you in your father&rsquo;s place.&rdquo; He waved his arm, making a shockwave appear.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith blocked the shockwave with her swords. *Froom*</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus&rsquo;s eyes dilated. Every one of his moves has been countered. Has this girl truly surpassed him? That thought made him angry, and he will never accept it. He threw another shockwave her.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith crossed her blades, making an X, blocking the shockwave. She swings the right blade, making a shockwave of her own. Rubeus was hit and knocked down to his knees. &ldquo;Ugh! This can&rsquo;t be happening...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is what happens when you stand on the wrong side of justice.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus chuckled. &ldquo;Justice? How laughable...I&rsquo;ll teach you to mess up my plans...&rdquo; His eyes, as well as his whole body began to glow a blinding white color. He was releasing all the stored up ki he had from meditating. As a result, the ground began to shake and fall apart, and the winds grew crazy.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith can feel his ki from where she&rsquo;s standing, and she covered her eyes from the wind. &ldquo;Ugh...I&rsquo;ve never felt a ki like this before.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You forced me to do this. I will die before I lose to a woman like you. Literally.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to become a human time bomb...soon all the ki will flow out of my body, causing an explosion that will destroy the entire castle.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No! You can&rsquo;t be serious!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Midas was bound to the column so he watched helplessly as the bloodthirsty demon approached him. He was sweating nervously.</p></p>

<p><p>The hound leapt at him and he winced. *Twang* An arrow hit it on the head, killing it instantly.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna showed up. &ldquo;Did I miss the party?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you, Faith&rsquo;s friend.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. The name&rsquo;s Marianna.&rdquo; She cut the rope and he was freed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Remind me to thank you later. Right now, we have a big problem on our hands!&rdquo; Midas pointed at the gang of demons.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This must be Rubeus&rsquo;s doing.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;And it will be our <strong>undoing</strong> if we don&rsquo;t close the portal soon.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> Mari grabbed some arrows from her patch and loaded them. Midas charged up an energy ball and threw it at the demons. *Bam*</p></p>

<p><p>*Twang* Mari just shot a hound in the face. Her arm reached over her shoulder to grab another arrow, but she ran out. &ldquo;Uhhh your majesty, we have a problem.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Midas and Mari backed away as the creatures approached them. Suddenly, Squire dropped down from above. &ldquo;Need some help?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mari: &ldquo;Boy do I ever!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Squire fired a beam, blowing a good portion of the creatures into smithereens.</p></p>

<p><p>Midas: &ldquo;I will try to close the portal. You two kill anything that comes out of it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Squire: &ldquo;Gotcha, your highness!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mari drew a sword and stood side by side with Squire.</p></p>

<p><p>Midas began chanting, closing his eyes and folding his fingers together. His body glowed a holy white color.</p></p>

<p><p>A demonic lizard crawled towards them and used its tongue to attack. They jumped away. Mari cut off its tongue, causing it to scream in pain. Squire threw an energy ball at the lizard and blew it up.</p></p>

<p><p>A group of hounds leapt at Squire, and he threw a bunch of energy balls at them. *Bam!*</p></p>

<p><p>The heroes were giving a valiant effort, unfortunately, demons were coming out of the hole as fast as they were being killed. The size of these creatures grew bigger and uglier by the minute. Suddenly, a gargoyle flew out, startling Marianna.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, they hear the tune of a flute being played. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s him!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darian appeared. &ldquo;Looks like you guys need some help.&rdquo; Despite being injured and roughed up, his face showed that he&rsquo;s full of energy and ready to rumble.</p></p>

<p><p>Squire: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the prince from another kingdom, aren&rsquo;t you? I was wrong about you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darian: &lsquo;&rdquo;Hmph. Any friend of the princess is a friend of mine.&rdquo; He played the flute, targeting only the gargoyle. It screamed in pain while shutting its ears.</p></p>

<p><p>Squire threw a beam and hit the gargoyle. Before it died, it saw nothing but a blinding light. *Kaboom*</p></p>

<p><p>Now they have three, which is much better than two. But the bad news is the demons continued to pile out of the hole. Each passing minute more of them were coming out. It reached a point where the portal was like a stuffed closet - they were fighting each other just to get out of it.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is crazy!&rdquo; exclaimed Mari.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Squire replied. &ldquo;His majesty is doing his best to close the portal...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darian: &ldquo;At this rate they will overrun us!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus continued to charge his ki as Faith tried to get closer to him. But the wind currents were too strong. They blew the sword out of her right hand. *Whoop* She marched forward. The sword flew out of her left hand. *Whoop* She put her arms over her face and kept marching. Her ki was strong enough to neutralize Rubeus&rsquo;s ki and she managed to reach him. She grabbed him and put her arms around his back.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What are you up to?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to let you blow up my home!&rdquo; She got behind him and held him by the underarms. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to explode, I&rsquo;ll make you do it somewhere else!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; he yelled.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith took him with her into the air. *Froom* She went as high as she possibly could.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Stop you fool!&rdquo; he yelled.</p></p>

<p><p>As they accelerated they became like a bullet in the air. Rubeus&rsquo;s ki kept them from being turned to dust by the tremendous air pressure. Once they were high enough, they started to descend downwards toward oblivion.</p></p>

<p><p>Mari, Squire and Darian were exhausted, but they still have to fight on. &ldquo;This portal&rsquo;s evil aura is too strong. I need more ki. I need to borrow your ki, youngsters.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Fine. I believe in you, your highness.&rdquo; said Squire. He stuck his palm out and began transferring his ki.</p></p>

<p><p>Darian: &ldquo;But we barely have any ki left. How can we defend ourselves...we won&rsquo;t be able to protect you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mari: &ldquo;Darian, he&rsquo;s only one who knows how to close the portal. We have to do it.&rdquo; She began transferring energy.</p></p>

<p><p>Darian was still reluctant, but he gave in anyway. He stuck out his palm and transferred his ki to Midas.</p></p>

<p><p>With all the extra energy he received, Midas&rsquo;s ki grew stronger, and he was able to shrink the portal. But it still required intense concentration from him.</p></p>

<p><p>Squire: &ldquo;Look, it&rsquo;s working!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The portal grew smaller and smaller, trapping the demons inside of it. Soon, it became the size of a TV screen, then smaller than a piece of paper, and eventually, it disappeared altogether. Finally, the noise was gone and things were quiet.</p></p>

<p><p>Midas fell to his knees. &ldquo;You did it, your highness!&rdquo; Squire exclaimed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We did it.&rdquo; Midas replied.</p></p>

<p><p>Mari was so happy that she jumped for joy. She hugged Darian and gave Squire a high five, and held his hands.</p></p>

<p><p>Their celebratory moment was cut short when she sensed Faith&rsquo;s ki. Mari looked at the sky. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No! This can&rsquo;t be happening!!&rdquo; Rubeus screamed as they descended into the forest.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was preparing herself for the end. (Goodbye everyone. It was nice knowing you all...)</p></p>

<p><p>*Kaboom!*</p></p>

<p><p> Everybody from the roof saw the explosion. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Darian asked. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me...the princess!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna jumped off the roof and dashed towards the forest, and Squire chased her.</p></p>

<p><p>Darian went over to the king. &ldquo;You alright, highness?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, just exhausted that&rsquo;s all. I&rsquo;m too old for all this...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mari and Squire came to the explosion site. Part of the ground was destroyed and became dust. &ldquo;Faith? Faith?&rdquo; She called and called but received no answer.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Her ki has disappeared...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No!!&rdquo; Mari fell to her knees. &ldquo;Faith...how could you leave me?! Uhhh!&rdquo; Tears stream down her face and she pounded the dust. &ldquo;You said we&rsquo;d be together forever! You liar!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Why are you crying?&rdquo; asked a woman&rsquo;s voice.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Because...because...huh?&rdquo; Mari looked up. &ldquo;Faith? You&rsquo;re alive!&rdquo; She ran over to her friend and embraced her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I guess so.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Squire went over to the girls. &ldquo;Princess! How did you survive that?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well, we were in the air...and...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No! This can&rsquo;t be happening!!&rdquo; Rubeus screamed as they descended into the forest.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was preparing herself for the end. (Goodbye everyone. It was nice knowing you all...)</p></p>

<p><p>Their speed increased as the descent continued, speeding up until their shields started to burn. At this point, they were like a comet, with enough force to cause heavy destruction. The pressure was too much for Faith to handle, and she was losing consciousness. Her hands slipped and slid off Rubeus.</p></p>

<p><p>Her body&rsquo;s trajectory separated from his, and they fell into different parts of the forest.</p></p>

<p><p>*Kaboom!*</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;When I woke up, I found myself on the ground. Rubeus was no where to be found. He most likely exploded and I landed behind a rock, which shielded me from the explosion. I guess you can call it dumb luck.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Squire shook his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it was luck. You are the chosen one, after all. The one who wields the Soul Swords can&rsquo;t die so easily.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mari: &ldquo;Whatever it was, I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re still alive. Don&rsquo;t do something stupid like that again, alright?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith smiled. &ldquo;Alright, I promise.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith and Marianna sit on a cliff and watch the sunrise together. The view from their angle was spectacular. Normally, it would have taken them 3 days to walk up there, but with their new found aerial skills, getting up here was a cinch.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So what&rsquo;re you going to do now?&rdquo; Marianna asked her friend.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Faith replied. They both did not take their eyes away from the sun.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Are you going to continue traveling or stay home?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I haven&rsquo;t thought about it that much. So much as happened.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But now that we can fly, we can go anywhere. Explore the world.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Hey, remember Sunrise village?&rdquo;<br>  &ldquo;What about it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ever wonder why it&rsquo;s called that?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmmm.&rdquo; Faith pointed a finger on her chin. &ldquo;I guess its because it&rsquo;s the best place to watch the Sunrise.&rdquo;</p></p>
