<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seven years ago Tyson met Princess Faith and they fell in love and joined forces against the tyrant Vega. But as new enemies appear, they suspect that Vega might still be alive. And as they figure out the truth, the dimensions start falling apart. What kind of power is behind this phenomenon? Can they save both worlds from total destruction?</p>

<p>The impact of Prince Mulder&rsquo;s tyranny was something that the heroes can never forget. After the prince&rsquo;s downfall, everyone has to find a way to move on with life. However, it is easier said than done, given all the tragedies that occurred. This is especially true for the Spade family. No matter how difficult it is, Tyson Spade has created miracles before, and it can certainly happen again&#8230;</p>

<p>Unable to settle his boredom, the young blonde haired man walked down the steps and saw his father. This man was merely a teenager, yet he looks mature for his age. With blonde hair and blue eyes, he could be considered handsome. <strong>Derik</strong> was wearing a white cape, which covered most of his body, and underneath the cape were loosely style clothes, a common style in medieval times.</p>

<p>Derik came out of his room and walked down the stairs. &ldquo;Father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A middle aged man was looking into a crystal ball. &ldquo;Ahh Derik, so nice of you to join me.&rdquo; Derik&rsquo;s father, Drago, is a wizard who practiced the black arts, a term referring to unorthodox practices banned by law.</p>

<p><strong>Drago</strong> had the eyes of a wild animal, a rebel who will do anything to get what he wants. Yet despite those eyes, he is actually a very knowledgeable fighter with many abilities, worthy of the title of wizard. He had spiky black hair, and he too wears medieval clothing, along with black gloves and black boots.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father, what are you looking at?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See these faces on the crystal globe?&rdquo; asked Drago.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see a man and a woman.&rdquo; replied Derik.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are not just any ordinary man and woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father, are you going tell one of your stories again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh but this is no story. It is a true event that happened in the past.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Derik asked in a tone of disbelief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Do you remember Vega, the master of darkness?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean the one and invincible Vega?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. He was destined to rule both dimensions. Unfortunately, he was defeated by two warriors&#8230;two mortals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can that be?&rdquo; Derik asked, a bit surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was their love that gave them the power to kill Vega. You see, they came from different dimensions. Princess Faith was from the kingdom of Almerak. Because Vega destroyed her home, she fled to the other dimension, where she met Tyson Spade. They formed an alliance and killed Vega. Nobody thought it was possible. Not even I, a great wizard, could have foreseen it coming. But they did. It was their love that killed Vega.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Love? I have heard of such an emotion...but I do not understand...how love makes them so strong?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither do I, my son. This is one of the strange mysteries of the universe. And I intend to solve this mystery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How, father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By investigating the lives of Tyson and Faith. But first, I must perform my other task.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your other task?&rdquo; Derik repeated. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Merging the two dimensions together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you need the Silver Crystal to accomplish that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and luckily it was not completely destroyed. Stay put, Derik. I shall be back soon.&rdquo; Drago walked towards the exit of the castle, and his body disappeared into the smoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be back soon, father.&rdquo; This story he just heard intrigued Derik and piqued his curiosity. He stared at the crystal ball, and in it was an image of Tyson and Faith&rsquo;s final battle with Vega. &ldquo;Just who exactly are they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, catch.&rdquo; said Tyson, throwing a Frisbee towards his son.</p>

<p>Junior ignored it. He sat down on the towel and started drawing.</p>

<p>Tyson scratched his head, wondering why Junior was upset. &ldquo;Junior? Don&rsquo;t you want to play?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith sat on the towel. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? Don&rsquo;t you want play with daddy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel like it.&rdquo; the boy answered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like Frisbee.&rdquo; He got up and walked away.</p>

<p>Faith sat there for a few moments, then got up and grabbed the Frisbee. &ldquo;Hey, catch Junior.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Junior caught it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay, now throw it to daddy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson opened his hands and smiled, expecting his son to throw him the Frisbee.</p>

<p>Junior was hesitant to do anything. He really did not feel like playing this stupid game. He looked both ways and saw a pond of mud to the right, and then a malicious smiled appeared on his lips.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Catch!&rdquo; He threw the Frisbee towards the mud.</p>

<p>Tyson ran for it. &ldquo;I got, I got it!&rdquo; he said, not knowing where it&rsquo;s going. He caught it, then slipped on the mud and fell. *Splash!*</p>

<p>Junior laughed, covering his mouth. As Tyson sat there in the dirty mud, he wondered if it was all planned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh my gosh. You are all dirty, Tyson.&rdquo; said Faith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No kidding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson, in the bathtub, grumbled unhappily. Faith was washing his hair. Tyson said that he did not need help taking a bath, but she insisted. They started talking as Faith washed his hair with shampoo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m starting to think Junior did that in purpose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He made me go to the mud. He wouldn&rsquo;t play with me before, and when he does, this happens. He never listens to me, he only listens to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I noticed that too. But I didn&rsquo;t want to say anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think he hates me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that. Just give him some time. He will get used to you eventually.&rdquo; Faith replied as a mother would.</p>

<p>Tyson sighed. &ldquo;Maybe&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The problem is that Junior is jealous. Each time he sees me spending time with you he gets all upset. I can tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am his father after all&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just spend a little more time with him. Share activities with him. Play with him. Then he will begin to accept you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drago appeared in a place called the inter-dimensional gateway, also known as the portal between two dimensions. Basically, this place is a gap of time and space between the two dimensions. There is nothing here but a void. The sky and the ground does not exist, there is nothing but torrents and raw energy.</p>

<p>He stood on a meteorite, one of a group of meteorites gathered together. There was nothing beyond those. Behind Drago was the Silver Crystal, brimming with energy.</p>

<p>Suddenly, four people appeared, all covered in black cloaks. Their faces were completely hidden, as well as their bodily features.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excellent. It is time to begin.&rdquo; said Drago.</p>

<p>He lowered his legs a little, and put his arms forward, much like that of a horse stance in martial arts. He powered up to the max, receiving energy from the Silver Crystal. His muscles tightened and veins popped out. Drago moaned and groaned from the stress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arrrrrgh&#8230;ughhhhh&#8230;arrrrr&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The four students in black cloaks also did the same, drawing energy from the crystal and channeling it into their own bodies.</p>

<p>As Drago continued this straining process, veins popped up on his forehead. The human body is not supposed to handle this much energy. One wrong move from Drago and it could be the end of him. Even if he is distracted for a split second, the energy could blow up his body from the inside.</p>

<p>However, he is highly trained in activities like these, and he will not stop until his task is complete.</p>

<p>Drago and the others saw two giant glowing spheres before him. They were the <strong>nemispheres</strong> of the two dimensions. Drago focused his energy into moving the two nemispheres together, and as he did, his hands were shaking, as if an invisible force was trying to tear them to pieces.</p>

<p>However, as the five mages combined their powers to move them, the nemispheres gradually moved towards each other. And as the spheres touched&#8230;</p>

<p>The entire planet shuddered. People from everywhere felt it. No matter where they were, in the cities, mountains, or on water, they felt it.</p>

<p>Tyson drank his coffee and loved it. &ldquo;This tastes great.&rdquo; He put the cup on the table. He noticed the coffee was shaking. &ldquo;Hmmm?&rdquo; Then it was shaking even more, and it spilled.</p>

<p>Faith was washing dishes, and the dishes she put down moved and fell on the floor. *Crack*</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ty&#8230;son! What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no idea!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Junior ran down the stairs. &ldquo;Mom, dad!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an earthquake!&rdquo; yelled Tyson.</p>

<p>The cabinet drawer fell on the floor, and the valuable dishes inside fell apart. The shaking became increasingly violent for every second that passed by. Even the floor began to crack. And so did the ceiling.</p>

<p>The family ran out of the house. The ground ripped apart and the house sank into it. *Crash!*</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, the house&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The family watched in agony as their house was eaten up in front of their very eyes. But there was no time to lament, for they were still not safe. The very earth that they stood on was shaking.</p>

<p>Tyson grabbed Faith&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;This way!&rdquo; They ran to the hills.</p>

<p>Junior fell down. &ldquo;Mom!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith grabbed his hand and helped him get up, and they continued to run.</p>

<p>Even Nebula felt it from where he was. He was training alone atop of some cliff. Due to the shaking, he had to float up to avoid the dangers. &ldquo;What is happening?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Macintosh remained in his lab, trying not to fall as the building shook with the ground.</p>

<p>Lisa crouched and put her arms over her head and screamed in a high-pitched voice as everything in her apartment fell and went crazy.</p>

<p>In Network City, roads cracked, buildings collapsed, and cars ran into the cracks. People ran in mobs in every direction. Even the police could not control the chaos.</p>

<p>The Natural Disaster Institute was on alert. The operators worked fast. Those by the computers made reports. Everybody was talking at the same time and people ran through halls in all directions. What they discovered that surprised them was the earthquake was not only in Network City, but the whole continent as well.</p>

<p>Mountains fell apart as the land was destroyed. Forests crumbled. Animals ran for their lives as their home was being destroyed.</p>

<p>Drago continued the process of merging. It was no easier than the first moments, and it was getting harder and harder. His muscles were strained but he ignored them. The nemispheres were very close to merging now.</p>

<p>Tyson and his family retreated to the hills, where they thought it would be safe. However, the disaster was happening everywhere, there was no place on earth that is safe.</p>

<p>Things started to get worse, much worse. Lava poured out from the cracks on the ground. The sky became dark. Thunder and lightning followed. It was as if earth became hell itself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is going on? Why is this happening?&rdquo; asked a disgruntled Faith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no idea.&rdquo; replied Tyson. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lived here all my life&#8230;and I have never seen anything like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly, the ground cracked and lava came pouring out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watch out!&rdquo; Tyson screamed.</p>

<p>They ran away from the lava. Suddenly, another crack appeared, and lava came flying at them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand back!&rdquo; Tyson screamed. Faith hugged Junior, fearing for the worst.</p>

<p>Tyson fired a beam at the lava, destroying it. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; he said, and they continued their escape.</p>

<p>Escape to where, they did not know. The entire place became an obstacle course, full of lava pits. One wrong move and it can mean the end.</p>

<p>By now, the two nemispheres were almost one. Drago and his students continued to release all their energies into the nemispheres. They knew that the task was almost done, it&rsquo;d just take a little more time.</p>

<p>This was no time to think about how it happened. Or why. Or what is causing it. Tyson can only think of saving himself and his family no matter what. Lava went towards them. Faith screamed and shut her eyes. Tyson flew up and fired a beam at it, keeping it away. &ldquo;Run! Run!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith ran without a thought. Tyson dodged some lava streams and blew up those that were close to Faith. Finally, they found a safe spot. They went up a cliff several hundred meters above ground level. The reached the edge and stared at the scenery. It started out as a nice and calm day, and suddenly into this hellish nightmare. How could this be? What phenomenon is causing it?</p>

<p>By this point, the planet Earth was in total chaos. Cities were wrecked and landscapes were ruined. The major systems of the world were shut down. All nuclear power, electricity, and solar energy sources were no longer useful since the facilities were destroyed. People panicked.</p>

<p>The news said it was a phenomenon. Scientists do not know why this happened. The best thing to do now is to wait. But wait for what? They did not answer. People do not know what to do. Their homes were destroyed. The homeless wandered around. Others who were lucky enough to still have homes remained and did not go outside due to fear.</p>

<p>By now the skies have calmed down, returning to its peaceful blue tone. The weirdest thing about this event was that places disappeared. Well, not quite. They were more like displaced. Certain buildings of Network City were found in East City, and vice versa. Not only that, but buildings and parks have appeared in other countries. Even whole cities were displaced. That&rsquo;s just about <strong>some</strong> of the effects of the phenomenon.</p>

<p>Tyson and his family took refuge on a cliff, inside a cave. Junior was sound asleep. He needed a good rest after all that struggling. &ldquo;Is it over?&rdquo; Faith asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The earthquakes have stopped for a while.&rdquo; Tyson replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness it&rsquo;s over.&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&#8230;but our house&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The important thing is that we survived. We lost our home, but that can be rebuilt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah that&rsquo;s true&#8230;it&rsquo;s such a shame that we lost everything.&rdquo; Tyson replied, looking at the horizon.</p>

<p>The three of them decided to back to see what was left of their house. To their pleasant surprise, it was still in one piece! Half of it was stuck underground, and the other half was sticking up. The whole thing was tilted at an angle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The house isn&rsquo;t destroyed.&rdquo; Tyson exclaimed. &ldquo;At least we haven&rsquo;t lost everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith was just as happy. &ldquo;The spirits must have protected our home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will we still be able to live in it?&rdquo; Junior asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Tyson replied, rolling up his sleeve. &ldquo;There is where I come in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a hand.&rdquo; said Junior.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I appreciate the thought. But I can handle this one. Stay back.&rdquo; said Tyson. Suddenly, he sensed some familiar presences.</p>

<p>Lisa and Nebula showed up. &ldquo;Hey guys!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson was happy to see them. &ldquo;Nebula. What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you guys experience the earthquake?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Faith replied. &ldquo;And look at what it did to our house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lisa: &ldquo;I felt from my apartment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;Wow. Some strange things have been going on here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;I know. I&rsquo;ve lived here for years and not a single natural disaster occurred. The eastern coast is the safest place on the continent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not anymore.&rdquo; Faith said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This earthquake did not happen just here. It happened all over the world.&rdquo; said Macintosh.</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;Macintosh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d find you guys here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zelfire was with him. &ldquo;You have no idea how much of a mess the world is in, in the past few hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;What the heck is going on, Mac?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mac: &ldquo;I have no clue. I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like this in my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;Why is this happening?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zelfire: &ldquo;This is too great to be man-made. Is something changing in the Earth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were not the only ones who were confused. The ones inside the Imperial Palace experienced the same confusion and panic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is happening?&rdquo; asked King Midas. He is the current king of Almerak and one of the oldest men in the kingdom. He was dressed in a golden, silk gown, with long sleeves, one that is fit for royalty. His distinguishable features are his white silk beard and mustache.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your majesty, the earthquake has stopped.&rdquo; said Marianna. She is Faith&rsquo;s best friend since childhood, and now is a good friend to Ace and companion to the king.</p>

<p>She started out as a mischievous thief who robbed rich people and lived on the streets. She was an orphan from the first day she was born and never met her parents, so she was kind of jealous of Faith and Ace since they still had a father. Despite her status, she and Faith get along very well, simply because neither of them cared about social status.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems so.&rdquo; said Prince Acelot, the son of Midas. At age ten, he ran away from the castle, leaving his sister and his father. At that time his father was cold to his children and treated them strictly. Acelot was fed up and left home for ten years. During that time he lived like a rogue, doing odd jobs here and there, while training his swordsmanship.</p>

<p>At some point down the line, he met Marianna while fighting Vega&rsquo;s army. Him and Marianna get along well, and during their adventures their friendship grew into something more. They both love each other but will never admit it.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Thank the heavens it is over.&rdquo; Midas exclaimed. &ldquo;Now things can go back to normal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your majesty!&rdquo; Marianna yelled, looking out the window. &ldquo;There is something you must see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas and Ace joined her. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;Look. It&rsquo;s the fields&#8230;the royal grounds are gone! There is nothing but trees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;How is that possible?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas: &ldquo;What kind of evil sorcery caused this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as clueless as you. I think we should go outside and investigate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;Is it safe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks safe to me. The earthquake is over. What could be worse than what we just been through?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Macintosh: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there will be any more disasters like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zelfire: &ldquo;Are you sure about that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not certain. The world can&rsquo;t afford another earthquake like this. It&rsquo;s already a mess.&rdquo;<br>  Zelfire: &ldquo;You are right. It could take months to get things back to normal. Even years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;Right now the important thing is that we are all okay. And our homes. We should be grateful for what is left over and try to get back what we have lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;I cannot believe my eyes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everybody turned attention to the three people approaching. Faith was shocked to see them. She was filled with joy and ran to her brother and gave him a big hug.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ace!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sister&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Faith hugged Marianna. And finally, she went over to her father and gave him a hug. &ldquo;Father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh Faith. It&rsquo;s good to see you again.&rdquo; said Midas. &ldquo;Have you been living well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ve been doing very well. There&rsquo;s no need to worry about me anymore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Junior pulled Faith&rsquo;s leg. &ldquo;Who are these people?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;Junior, meet your grandpa. Grandpa Midas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandpa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas: &ldquo;Oh&#8230;you are&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;Yes, father. He is my son. Go on, Junior, say hello.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;H-Hello.&rdquo; the boy said shyly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My grandson!&rdquo; Midas picked him up and hugged him.</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;Since when did you guys come to this dimension?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;Actually we did not come here&#8230; we thought you came to our dimension.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zelfire: &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;We just left the palace and found you guys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Macintosh: &ldquo;Something really weird is happening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;No kidding. What the heck is going on?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you really want to know? I will tell you?&rdquo; answered the voice of Drago.</p>

<p>His voice got everyone&rsquo;s attention, and they all froze like deer in headlights. Seconds later, smoke came from the ground in a spiral pattern and Drago appeared.</p>

<p>Everyone was shocked at the mysterious appearance of this stranger. Who exactly is Drago, and what are his intentions? Is he an enemy? What kinds of powers does he possess?</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="PF_02_A">02: A New Enemy Appears! The Involuntary Traitor </span></p></center>


<p>The heroes from both dimensions have reunited once again. Despite what is happening on earth, they experienced a brief moment of joy reuniting with their loved ones. However, their brief moment was cut short with the sudden arrival of Drago.</p>

<p>Tyson just stared blankly at the stranger, Drago, who wore black clothing and a white cape. He had a wicked smile on his face, his arms crossed. Junior was scared and he hid behind his mother&rsquo;s leg.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just who are?&rdquo; Nebula demanded to know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Drago. I am honored to meet all of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Tyson spoke up. &ldquo;You said you&rsquo;re going to tell us what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Drago replied. &ldquo;The dimensions have been merged!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This shocked everyone. They were all open-mouthed and dumbfounded.</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zelfire: &ldquo;The dimensions&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lisa: &ldquo;Have been merged?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drago: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. The two dimensions as you know it no longer exists. They are now one dimension.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mac thought about it for a second. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, it makes sense. It explains the earthquakes that have happened throughout the world, as well as that horrible storm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Acelot: &ldquo;But how did it happen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drago: &ldquo;Heh. The answer is simple. &lsquo;Twas I who merged these two dimensions into one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna pointed at him. &ldquo;You did?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not an easy task. It required a tremendous amount of spiritual endurance and energy to complete the task.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;Stop kidding around! You need the Silver Crystal to merge the dimensions. It was destroyed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but not entirely. A small piece of it was left, and that small piece was all that was needed for the merger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you do it? Don&rsquo;t you know how much chaos you&rsquo;ve caused?!&rdquo; said Zelfire angrily, holding a fist.</p>

<p>Drago: &ldquo;Heh, that&rsquo;s to be expected. It&rsquo;s a side effect of the merger. We&rsquo;re talking about combining the two masses into one. The world cannot fit that much mass, so everything has to be squeezed into other places. Continents have collided, oceans have split apart, and the planet itself is in turmoil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;Why did you do this? Who do you work for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drago: &ldquo;I do it because this is all part of Vega&rsquo;s master plan!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon hearing that name, everyone became shocked.</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;V-Vega?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is correct. Now that the world is in chaos thanks to my doing, Vega will be able to take over it easily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;Newsflash, Vega is dead! He was killed by Tyson and Faith!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drago: &ldquo;You <em>think </em>he died. But you are very wrong. How ignorant you are. Did you think mere mortals like you can kill the great Vega?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith was completely shocked. Her knees trembled. &ldquo;You mean&#8230;Vega is&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is alive!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alive! No, that can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo; she blurted out. The world around her seemed to turn to darkness.</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;Faith, don&rsquo;t believe him. He&rsquo;s trying to mess with our heads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drago: &ldquo;Whether you believe me or not, that is up to you. Soon, it will not matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard enough of this crap, Drago. You better undo what you have done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drago laughed. &ldquo;Moron! Once the dimensions have been merged, they cannot be separated again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson was in disbelief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true.&rdquo; said Midas. &ldquo;The merging process cannot be reversed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drago: &ldquo;Face it. You are all doomed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;Oh, and how is that? What are you going to do to us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not I who will you kill. But some one else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; asked Tyson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Someone within your group. There is a traitor amongst you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All the heroes looked at each other.</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;A traitor among us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mac: &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ya see he&rsquo;s lying? He&rsquo;s making this up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drago crossed his arms. &ldquo;Oh, am I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re lying. There is no traitor among us. I&rsquo;m sure of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drago crossed his arms. &ldquo;Hmmph. Believe what you want, but I know what I know.&rdquo; He smiled evilly.</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just kill this guy. I&rsquo;m tired of hearing this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drago: &ldquo;Fools! Suffer the wrath of Vega!&rdquo; He disappeared just like the way he appeared. A puff of smoke came from the ground and covered him. Then he was gone.</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;Where did he go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;This is another one of his tricks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They can hear the maniacal laughter of Drago. &ldquo;Ha ha ha ha ha!&rdquo; The annoying voice echoed throughout the area. They do not see him and have no idea where he is.</p>

<p>Suddenly, dust appeared from thin air. But this dust was more like a mist, a mist so thick they could not see through it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everyone stay together!&rdquo; said Tyson.</p>

<p>But it was easier said than done when they can&rsquo;t see anything. Suddenly, a shadow appeared behind him and attacked. Tyson ducked and elbowed the troop in the stomach. *Thud*</p>

<p>When he was knocked out, Tyson looked at his face. It was a faceless man in a gray spandex suit, a Dark Society soldier.</p>

<p>A soldier tried to attack Faith, but she ducked, and punched the guy in the chest. Then she turned around, grabbed his arm and threw him on the ground. Wham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Junior! Where are you? Junior!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Junior wandered off by himself. &ldquo;Mom&#8230;dad? Where are you?&rdquo; He was getting scared. &ldquo;Mom? Where is everybody?&rdquo; Then he bumped into Drago and gasped. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re that scary man&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am scary, am I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8230;gotta go.&rdquo; He ran for it.</p>

<p>Drago grabbed him by the collar. &ldquo;Going somewhere, kid?&rdquo; He grinned. Then he tossed the poor kid on the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oof!&rdquo; Junior dislikes many things, and he dislikes being bullied especially. Drago approached him. Junior got himself back on his feet. &ldquo;That hurt. Why you&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now kid, you&rsquo;re going to obey me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No way!&rdquo; the kid shouted back. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re&#8230;just like him.&rdquo; He was referring to Prince Mulder, the one who caused him much suffering back then. Thinking about that bad man makes him angry, and he charged up his ki. Suddenly, he jumped and punched.</p>

<p>Drago blocked it, and punched the kid in the stomach. Wham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fierce and strong.&rdquo; Drago commented. &ldquo;As expected from the son of Tyson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Junior couldn&rsquo;t get up and grunted in pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, listen up, child, you will obey my commands.&rdquo;<br>  &ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will obey my commands&#8230;&rdquo; he said in a hypnotic voice. His eyes glowed white.</p>

<p>Junior looked at his eyes and fell under his control. His vision became blurry and soon he saw nothing but a white light. All his senses were distorted&#8230;and he was no longer himself. Junior could hear nothing but the sound of Drago&rsquo;s commanding voice.</p>

<p>Drago: &ldquo;It is a difficult task to control the mind of a human being, but the mind of a child is easily manipulated. Junior, you will kill your parents, do you understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Junior made no response. His eyes were different than before, they were no longer they eyes of a child, but those of an emotionless killer. <br>  &ldquo;Good. I cannot wait to see the expression on their faces when they get slaughtered by their own son!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna and Ace bumped into each other and nearly mistook each other for enemies. After one second, they relaxed, realizing it wasn&rsquo;t the enemy.</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;I thought you were Drago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;This dust is too thick. I can barely see a thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There has to be a way to get rid of this fog. We gotta be careful. This is the perfect setup for a surprise attack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As they continued to walk, Marianna saw something from far away. An energy ball came, and she pushed Ace out of the way. Kaboom!</p>

<p>A man behind the mist crept up behind Marianna while she was loading an arrow into her bow. Ace drew his sword and stabbed the soldier. *Schleb!*</p>

<p>Marianna fired her Celestial Arrow into the other soldier&rsquo;s head, killing him instantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I almost forgot that we make a good team.&rdquo; she commented. Ace smiled.</p>

<p>Nebula was lost and frustrated. &ldquo;Alright, enough of these tricks. Come on out and show yourself you coward!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>

<p>Faith happened to sense Tyson&rsquo;s energy signal. &ldquo;Tyson! It&rsquo;s me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good I found you. We better stick together. Don&rsquo;t even get one inch away from me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you seen Junior?&rdquo; she asked as they started walking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just a boy&#8230;&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s scared and confused right now. We have to find him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. We will find him.&rdquo; Tyson replied.</p>

<p>They searched and searched in the dust. Ten minutes have passed and they didn&rsquo;t find anyone. Faith was getting more worried every second.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Junior! Junior!&rdquo; she called.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Junior!&rdquo; called Tyson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Junior? Where are you?&rdquo; Her replies were answered by silence. &ldquo;What will I do if anything happens to him? My dear son&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faith, get a hold of yourself!&rdquo; he said, shaking her by the shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mommy?&rdquo; said Junior.</p>

<p>Faith was overjoyed and ran to hug her sweet little son. &ldquo;Junior! I was so worried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The kid just pushed her off like she was nobody.</p>

<p>Faith did not understand why he just did that. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Junior?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson looked at his son&rsquo;s eyes and knew right away he wasn&rsquo;t his usual self. &ldquo;Wait, Faith. He&rsquo;s not normal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean? Not normal?&rdquo; she asked stupidly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s our son. Come on, Junior, I will protect you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Junior drew a fist and charged at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watch out!&rdquo; shouted Tyson.</p>

<p>Faith got hit in the chest and was really surprised. &ldquo;Junior&#8230;what is wrong? It&rsquo;s me, your mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be careful, Faith! He&rsquo;s under some kind of spell.&rdquo; Suddenly, he just remembered Drago&rsquo;s words. There is a traitor amongst one of you. So this is what he meant? Their son, the involuntary traitor?</p>

<p>Junior gathered energy and fired an energy ball. Faith watched it come at her and she screamed. &ldquo;Ahhh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson got in front of her and blocked it. Bam! &ldquo;Stop, son!&rdquo; said Tyson. &ldquo;Snap out of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith approached him. &ldquo;Stop it Junior&#8230;it&rsquo;s us, your parents.</p>

<p> &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t hear us, don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>No, Faith did not see. As far as she was concerned, her precious little boy would never turn on her. Never. She will get him back no matter what. Her blind love kept her in denial of the facts.</p>

<p>Junior jumped and kicked, Tyson stepped to the side and dodged. Junior bounced back at him and punched his face. Wham! He felt it good. (He&rsquo;s got more power in him that I thought. It has to be Drago&rsquo;s influence&#8230;)</p>

<p>Faith, on the ground, called her son. &ldquo;Stop&#8230;stop&#8230;Junior&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The kid did not understand or hear what she said. To him, she is not his mother, but a target who must be killed. He grunted and charged. Faith made no attempt to defend herself and got hit. *Pow*</p>

<p>&ldquo;Junior, my son! Please stop!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Junior charged and kicked her, she blocked by crossing her arms over her face. *Wham* Faith was sent rolling on the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; Tyson yelled. He grunted angrily, thinking of a way out of this predicament. He stared at Junior&rsquo;s lifeless eyes. In an instant, his son has become a killing machine, obeying someone else&rsquo;s orders.</p>

<p>Drago, who was not seen, was moving his hands, controlling Junior like a puppet. His eyes glowed. &ldquo;Now, Junior, kill them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8230;I will kill you!&rdquo; Junior powered up and shot an energy ball.</p>

<p>Tyson dodged it, then ran at the kid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; yelled Faith. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurt him! He&rsquo;s our son!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Junior punched, Tyson kicked him.</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;Stop! Stop Tyson!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Junior punched and Tyson dodged side to side, avoiding the child&rsquo;s fast fists. Junior punched, Tyson grabbed his fist. Junior punched using his other fist, then Tyson got hit. *Pow*</p>

<p>Junior jumped into him, about to punch, when Tyson blurred. The kid was confused, looking around to find the enemy.</p>

<p>Tyson appeared behind Junior. &ldquo;Sorry I have to do this. It&rsquo;s for your own good.&rdquo; He gave his son a karate chop on his neck. *Whack!*</p>

<p>Tyson picked him up. Faith ran to him and grabbed her son. &ldquo;Junior&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be alright.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The smoke disappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My plan has failed.&rdquo; said Drago. &ldquo;It must be the love of Junior&rsquo;s parents. The love they have for him allowed them all to survive. There is much more I have to learn about these humans.&rdquo; He vanished.</p>

<p>Once everything went back to normal, the heroes saw each other and became relieved.</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;Oh guys, thank God. It&rsquo;s all over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zelfire: &ldquo;Somebody tell me what the hell was that about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace looked at Junior, who was unconscious in Faith&rsquo;s arms. &ldquo;How is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;He will be alright. I won&rsquo;t let anything happen to my son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Back at Skull Mountain, Drago just told the news to his son and his four students. His students wore masks and were covered by black capes.</p>

<p>Derik: &ldquo;But father, why did you not kill them while you had the chance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should I spoil the fun? They have proven worthy to be studied. Human emotions are something I have been researching for quite a while now, yet I understand so little of it. Perhaps this is the chance for me to finally understand the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will Vega think of this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, worry not, my son. He has confidence in me. The Dark Society is too powerful to lose to people like them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His students just watched silently on the side. Drago turned to them. &ldquo;Listen up. I have some important business to take care of. Derik, I will put you in charge of my men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; Derik replied, a bit surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. You will lead my students and explore this dimension. Report to me once you find something important.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will obey Derik as though he is me, understood?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes master.&rdquo; said his students, bowing.</p>

<p>Acelot was sitting down, leaning against a column, and polishing his sword. Marianna was standing across from him, her arms crossed, deep in thought. Nebula showed up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Can&rsquo;t sleep?&rdquo; Nebula asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about yourself?&rdquo; Ace replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not. Not after everything I&rsquo;ve heard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Acelot: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to worry about. This Drago guy is just a regular sorcerer. We can kill him once we find him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not him I&rsquo;m worried about. It&rsquo;s what he said. He said Vega is still alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon hearing that, Marianna opened her eyes.</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;Do you think he&rsquo;s still alive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No way.&rdquo; Ace replied confidently. &ldquo;My sister took care of him a long time ago, remember? He&rsquo;s been dead for seven years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;I hope so. If there&rsquo;s a slight chance Drago is telling the truth&#8230;then what we are about to face is going to be one hell of a war.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vega sat on his royal chair, draining energy from the four crystals around him. &ldquo;Ahh, seven years ago I sought to unite the two dimensions into one so I can control both of them easily. And now, the first step of my master plan is finally complete. Ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="PF_03_A">03: Assault On The Imperial Palace. A New War Begins </span></p></center>


<p>The heroes decided to stay in the Imperial Palace for safety. It is more convenient if everyone is gathered at one central place.</p>

<p> Faith put her son to her bed so he could rest and get well. She and Tyson, however, decided to go back home, to see what they&rsquo;ve lost and what they can recover. Faith trusted her father to take care of her son. Midas was more than happy to play babysitter, after all, it&rsquo;s his first time meeting his grandson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm, all the expensive china is broken. At least the furniture is okay.&rdquo; said Tyson, picking up the pieces. He appeared to be calm, then he suddenly snapped. He grabbed his hair and screamed crazily. &ldquo;Ahhh! It&rsquo;s gonna take a friggin&rsquo; month to fix this mess! Ahhhh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as Tyson went crazy and Faith went to the river to do the laundry, the rest of the heroes gathered in the royal room, hopefully to make some sense of the events of the past day.</p>

<p>Ace sat lazily on the floor, leaning against a column. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a while. How have you guys been doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t be better.&rdquo; Nebula answered. &ldquo;Until now, that is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zelfire still has something on his mind. &ldquo;Do you all believe that Vega is alive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say that guy who attacked us is nuts.&rdquo; said Ace with a carefree attitude. Out of everyone, he is the most relaxed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know for sure. Why would he lie?&rdquo; Marianna asked.</p>

<p>Mac said: &ldquo;If that is true then we are in big trouble. I remember what a terrible opponent he was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Relax.&rdquo; said Nebula. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve beaten him once. We can do it again.&rdquo; Out of everyone, he is the most confident, as usual.</p>

<p>Marianna, however, is not as confident. &ldquo;Nebula, it&rsquo;s not as simple as you think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mac: &ldquo;Yeah. This time they kept their operations secret from us. The dimensions have already been merged. We are one step behind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;And worst of all, the enemy knows where we are. They will find us and attack the castle. Even the best guards can&rsquo;t stop them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zelfire: &ldquo;That is why we have to have a plan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upstairs, Midas was watching Junior as he slept. The kid yawned and woke up. He opened his cute eyes and stared at the king. &ldquo;Grandpa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my child. You awoke at last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They started chatting and Midas showed his grandson some of the castle&rsquo;s old artifacts. When he presented each one, he told a story about it, like there&rsquo;s this jar and it once belonged to a ferocious tiger. Junior listened to his stories with much interest. He was even more interested in the artifacts. There were all sorts of them; jars, a golden arrow, swords, and statues.</p>

<p>Derik, by chance, found a lake with clear water. &ldquo;Stay here.&rdquo; he ordered the students. He saw a woman washing clothes and he hid behind the bushes to watch. Who is she, he wondered. As he looked more closely, he recognized her as Princess Faith, the one his father told him about.</p>

<p>Faith scrubbed Tyson&rsquo;s dirty shirt (the one he wore when he fell in mud). The stain won&rsquo;t come off. She scrubbed harder. Finally, some results. She scrubbed some more and the stain was mostly gone.</p>

<p>Derik noticed she was very beautiful. He grew fond of her immediately and watched her work without blinking.</p>

<p>Student A grew impatient. &ldquo;What are we, some kind of chumps? He tells us to wait here while he goes off having fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quiet, Blaire.&rdquo; said Student B. &ldquo;We must obey Derik&rsquo;s orders. Our master ordered us to obey him, so just be patient and we can get this mission over with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot take this any longer. How long are we supposed to wait here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith finished the laundry. She put the clothes back in the basket and walked through the woods. Derik showed himself and got in her way. &ldquo;Greetings, Princess Faith of Almerak. I have heard much about you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh? Who are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derik bowed. &ldquo;I am Derik, son of Drago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drago? You mean that evil wizard? You are his son?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I am so glad to have the pleasure of meeting you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmmm.&rdquo; Faith turned her head sideways rudely. &ldquo;I wish I could say the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have come to challenge you to a duel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A duel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I have heard of your skills as a swordsman. They say you are in possession of the Soul Swords, am I correct? You must be very skilled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I appreciate the gesture, but I will have to decline.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? You are refusing?&rdquo; He seemed surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a problem with that? I have a right to decline, do I not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t refuse a duel&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derik was getting angry at her rudeness. &ldquo;How dare you! You will fight me now or else.&rdquo; He drew his sword.</p>

<p>Faith did not show fear. She responded with indifference. &ldquo;What, are you going to kill me now? That is just what I expect from you kind of people. You are blood-thirsty and live only to battle, hurting others in the process.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? You can&rsquo;t judge me that way!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the truth and you know it. I have no tolerance for people like you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derik was shocked at what she said. She just walked past him like he was nothing. He just stood there like a deer in headlights.</p>

<p>Tyson placed a big piece of wood vertically on the ground. He then pushed it down, drilling a hole, so solidify the foundation of the wood. Faith came back and placed her laundry on the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faith. I have some good news. The house has sunk a few feet into the ground. But it&rsquo;s mostly in one piece. So it can still be saved.&rdquo;<br>  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good.&rdquo; she replied blankly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? You seemed to be bothered by something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s nothing. Nothing at all. I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo; she replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yeah, I&rsquo;m finished with the laundry. Here&rsquo;s your shirt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow. You did a great job. I can&rsquo;t see a spec of mud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, how&rsquo;s Junior doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s with father. They are having a great time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Darn. He likes his grandfather, but not me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith sighed, then she placed her hands on Tyson&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I like you. Does that help?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will Junior ever like me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just give him some time and he will accept you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So once again, we are fighting together against the Dark Society, as we once did seven years ago.&rdquo; said Nebula, crossing his arms.</p>

<p>Ace was polishing his sword. &ldquo;This time however, we are protecting one dimension instead of two. We have to do our best to protect it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can barely protect ourselves.&rdquo; Marianna replied. &ldquo;The wizard called Drago ...has fearsome abilities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everyone should stay on alert.&rdquo; said Ace. &ldquo;He can attack us at anytime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zelfire: &ldquo;We cannot win by just being on the defensive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;But how will we attack? We know nothing about the enemy...yet they know everything about us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;Which is why we can&rsquo;t just stay here like a bunch of sitting ducks.&rdquo; Marianna: &ldquo;I know how you feel. But we can&rsquo;t do anything reckless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just now, Junior, holding Midas&rsquo;s hand, walked into the room.</p>

<p>Junior: &ldquo;Hey everybody. What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas: &ldquo;They are discussing something very important.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh? What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lisa: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s adult stuff. Kids won&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take you to the dungeon, shall we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Junior: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a dungeon here? Cool!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king took the kid away.</p>

<p>Lisa: &ldquo;I feel bad for Junior. He lost his home in just one day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mac: &ldquo;Do you think it&rsquo;s right to keep this from Juniro&#8230;you know, about our war?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a kid. He does not need to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;But won&rsquo;t he find out eventually?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mac: &ldquo;Yeah. I just think it&rsquo;s wrong to hide this from him, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;Tyson&rsquo;s son is a bright kid. But he&rsquo;s too young to understand what we have to go through. It&rsquo;s better this way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;I agree with Nebula.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unable to agree on a course of action, the heroes ended the conversation and parted ways to various parts of the castle. Nebula, the one who itches most to fight, is unable to because he does not know where the enemy is. He has no choice but to wait for them to attack. To know nothing about the enemy, yet the enemy knows everything about you, is a very disadvantageous situation.</p>

<p>Derik was resting on the ground while those in black cloaks waited. &ldquo;Derik, are you ready?&rdquo; asked Student #1.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am no longer tired.&rdquo; Derik replied, standing up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we better get going. It is going to be dark soon.&rdquo; said Student #3.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The castle should be somewhere in this area. That is what my father said. Come, we can find it shortly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a traveling for a while into the dark woods, they stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There it is.&rdquo; announced Derik. &ldquo;This is the Imperial Palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Student #1: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything so great about this place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Student #3: &ldquo;Let us get on with this mission.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were hiding in the trees. The castle was in plain view from their location.</p>

<p>Derik: &ldquo;Go. I will wait here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The students vanished in a second.</p>

<p>Midas took Junior outside to the roof of his castle, where they enjoyed fresh air and a star-filled sky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow, grandpa, look at the stars. They&rsquo;re so bright.&rdquo; Junior pointed his index finger at the sky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. There are millions of them.&rdquo; Midas replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandpa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do spirits exist?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes they do. There are all kinds of spirits. Good ones, bad ones, powerful ones, you name it. They are everywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas gasped, sensing a disturbance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong grandpa?&rdquo; asked the child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run!&rdquo; He grabbed the kid and ran towards the door, then turned around.</p>

<p>Four shadows jumped from nowhere and landed.</p>

<p>Junior: &ldquo;Who&#8230;who are these people?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Student #3: &ldquo;Greetings, your majesty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Things don&rsquo;t look so good now. The king and his grandson were in great danger. Midas was extra cautious now, ready to receive an attack. But he had to protect his grandson first. &ldquo;Run Junior! Run!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&#8230;but&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The students attacked. Midas jumped into the air. The students moved so fast their bodies looked like blurry lines. They attacked the king together, hitting him continuously, not giving him a chance to fight back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandpa!&rdquo; Junior yelled nervously. &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out of here, child&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The students laughed. &ldquo;Any last words, your majesty?&rdquo; said the third.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold it right there!&rdquo; said Nebula. He was joined by the other heroes and they stood in front of the king.</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;Who are these people?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;Vega&rsquo;s goons, no doubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are the students of Drago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;Students of Drago?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zelfire: &ldquo;I can tell they&rsquo;re strong. They&rsquo;re not to be underestimated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Allow us to introduce ourselves.&rdquo; said the first. He removed his hood and cloak, revealing the body hidden underneath. He had bright orange hair, wore metal armor on his chest, as well as black boots.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Blaire! At your service.&rdquo; He took out a torch, then blew into it, and a huge hurricane of fire was produced. The heroes watched in amazement.</p>

<p>Then the second student revealed herself. It was a young woman, dressed in light ninja clothes, and she had long, blue hair that reached down to her knee. Her eyes were evil and deceiving. She had a face that couldn&rsquo;t be trusted. &ldquo;My name is Maxima.&rdquo; She took out a sword and pointed it forward.</p>

<p>The third student took off his hood and cloak. He wore a mask that covered half of his face. He had long, brown hair that almost covered his eyes. He had a shoulder pad on one side, and white boots. &ldquo;I am Serpent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Finally, the last one revealed himself. He was not a man at all, but a rock with a face and the shape of a person. &ldquo;Roar!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;I am Graveller!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zelfire: &ldquo;Damn, he is ugly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Graveller: &ldquo;Roar!!!&rdquo; His body was turning red with rage and smoke came out.</p>

<p>Maxima: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in deep trouble now. Graveller hates it when people call him ugly. You just got him mad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blaire: &ldquo;Today is your unlucky day that you ran into us. Have you any last words?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula stepped forward. &ldquo;Heh, isn&rsquo;t it rude to introduce yourselves but let us do the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blaire raised his eyebrow. &ldquo;And who are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Nebula.&rdquo; said he, proudly pointing at himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Zelfire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Prince Acelot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I am Marianna, at your service!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blaire: &ldquo;Ha. I wouldn&rsquo;t feel so proud if I were you. Who are you compared to the students of Drago?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;Oh, and why is that? We&rsquo;ve never even heard of Drago before. Of course everybody knows the Prince of Almerak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Serpent chuckled. &ldquo;Almerak is gone. What&rsquo;s left of it is this castle, which will not even exist after tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;Why you&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;That does it! I can&rsquo;t stand you anymore. Get ready to defend yourselves!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All except Nebula and Blaire blurred out of sight. Then the two ran into each other and hit, then blurred out of sight.</p>

<p>Midas grabbed Junior by the arm to take him to safety. &ldquo;Come on, Junior, we must leave this place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blaire and Nebula hit each other non-stop, neither scoring a hit so far. Blair then spit fire out of his mouth, causing Nebula to cover his face. &ldquo;Aaah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>While distracted, Blaire punched Nebula in the face, then in the stomach. *Thud*</p>

<p>Ace charged forward, and intending to end this fight in one hit, put in all his might to swing his blade. It hit Graveller&rsquo;s chest, but he showed no reaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo; Ace exclaimed.</p>

<p>Graveller roared and smacked Ace away. *Thud*</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oof!&rdquo; He got up. &ldquo;This guy is rock solid. How am I supposed to hurt him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rock man then pointed his arms forward and his hand came off, flying like a projectile. It hit Ace&rsquo;s sword, and knocked him back a little bit. The stone hands circled Ace, who&rsquo;s having a hard time hitting them.</p>

<p>In the air, Marianna punched ruthlessly as Maxima blocked with equal speed. She smiled confidently. Marianna kicked, Maxima got below her and kicked her back. *Wham!* Marianna was hit.</p>

<p>The stone hands knocked the sword out of Ace&rsquo;s hand, and the hands returned to Graveller. Ace grunted and attacked his target head on. *Pow* He punched Graveller in the face, but nothing happened. He grew more upset and continued his pointless assault, hitting his chest and even kicking his neck. Graveller tilted his neck, showing no signs of pain.</p>

<p>He grabbed Ace&rsquo;s leg and slammed him on the floor. *Wham* Then he grabbed Ace by the neck and strangled him. Unable to pull off the big, clunky hands, he thought he was done for.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a beam hit Graveller, blowing him into pieces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got you!&rdquo; Zelfire announced.</p>

<p>Ace stood up, coughing and holding his neck. &ldquo;You did it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly, Serpent came out from the ground and kicked Zelfire away.</p>

<p> &ldquo;You fool. Graveller cannot be killed so easily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Ace recovered, he gasped as he watched the rock chunks on the floor move by themselves. They gathered together and formed Graveller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This guy is not simple at all!&rdquo; said Ace.</p>

<p>Serpent shot out needles from his wrist, Zelfire ran towards him and ducked to avoid the needles. *Whoosh* Zelfire punched, Serpent evaded to the side, moving so fast that Zelfire&rsquo;s eyes can&rsquo;t keep up with him. Serpent kicked him, knocking him to where Ace is.</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;These guys are tougher than I thought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zelfire: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re telling me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Graveller screamed and smashed the ground, creating a shockwave that went towards the heroes. The ground they stood on exploded, hitting them hard, and sent them flying into the air.</p>

<p>Marianna slashed at Maxima, but Maxima blocked with two daggers. Marianna grunted as Maxima smiled. They pushed their weapons forward, using a lot of strength. Maxima managed to push her away, then kicked her down.</p>

<p>Nebula and Blaire exchanged some fists in the air, and Nebula punched him away. After Nebula landed, Serpent shot a dozen poison needles at him. They were hard to see in the dark because they were so small and thin. *Sch sch sch* A line of needles hit the ground, going towards Nebula&rsquo;s leg. He quickly jumped away.</p>

<p>Serpent shot more needles, Nebula drew his sword and swings it at the right time, slashing the needles away.</p>

<p>While distracted, Blaire threw a fire tornado at him, and Nebula blocked it. *Froom* But he blocked it too late, the fire had already surrounded him, and it burned him. Nebula collapsed and his clothes were smoking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugh...&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna stood up. &ldquo;Nebula, you okay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll manage...&rdquo; he responded.</p>

<p>Ace and Zelfire managed to stand up, but by the looks of it, they can barely fight.</p>

<p>Maxima: &ldquo;Ha ha ha. These are the earth guardians that Vega is worried about? I don&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zelfire: &ldquo;Did you just say Vega?&rdquo;</p>

<p> Blaire: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just finish them off now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough of this!&rdquo; said a distant voice. Everyone&rsquo;s attention turned to the silhouetted man standing on the tower. Tyson jumped off the tower and landed.</p>

<p>Maxima: &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blaire: &ldquo;I recognize you. You are Tyson Spade, aren&rsquo;t ya? The one that worries Vega so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been causing trouble while I&rsquo;m gone. Come, I&rsquo;ll take on all of you at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The four students reacted with anger.</p>

<p>Nebula crawled up, and smiled. &ldquo;Tyson&rsquo;s here&#8230;ha&#8230;just like himself, trying to take on all of them&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The students surrounded Tyson, but he showed no fear. His face showed only contempt and hatred.</p>

<p>Maxima: &ldquo;You sure talk big. But I don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s the big deal...you&rsquo;re just another mediocre fighter like the rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Graveller will crush!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;You will&#8230;regret ever coming here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blaire: &ldquo;Ooh, such tough words.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Serpent: &ldquo;He is over confident.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alright, Sayan, you die now!&rdquo; Blaire leaped and attacked.</p>

<p>Tyson did not bother turning around. He raised his fist and Blaire&rsquo;s face ran into it. Wham! He fell. Maxima and Serpent charged. Tyson jumped into the air.</p>

<p>Graveller jumped and punched, Tyson dodged and kicked him away.</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;Careful! That rock man can&rsquo;t be killed so easily!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;No kidding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Graveller stopped in the air, and his hands came off of his body and charged at Tyson. He dodged them, and they turned around and came for him again. Tyson dodged, then Serpent shot a dozen needles at him. Tyson formed the Electro-shield, destroying all the needles.</p>

<p>Maxima: &ldquo;What is he, made up of pure energy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blaire took out a wooden stick, then blew into it. A hurricane of fire was formed and went at Tyson. It didn&rsquo;t penetrate the shield. &ldquo;Damn!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson fired the Energy Blast at the ground. Maxima jumped out of the way and Blaire was knocked away. &ldquo;Aaah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Serpent: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Graveller charged. Tyson used the Power Punch and punched his stomach. Pow! His fist went through the monster and he screamed in pain and fell apart. Bam! Tyson dodged an energy ball. He jumped on the rocks and was as fast as a shadow.</p>

<p>Maxima appeared and punched. He dodged the fist, then grabbed her arm. &ldquo;I usually don&rsquo;t like to hit women. If you surrender now, I&rsquo;ll go easy on you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How dare you!&rdquo; She jumped away. Maxima got ready to attack.</p>

<p>Serpent appeared behind Tyson and attacked. Tyson jumped to the side. His feet bounced off a boulder, and he went at Serpent and punched him. Kapow! <br>  Maxima: &ldquo;This is not possible!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Serpent landed on one knee. &ldquo;So, now I see why Vega worries so much about this warrior.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blaire: &ldquo;Why that little punk!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Graveller&rsquo;s pieces gathered together and became himself again. He roared.</p>

<p>Serpent: &ldquo;We have no choice but to retreat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maxima: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky this time, Tyson Spade!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The students flew away.</p>

<p>Nebula ran to his brother happily. &ldquo;You did it man! You were totally awesome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson scratched his head and laughed. &ldquo;I guess so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;Boy, you sure showed them who&rsquo;s boss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;Luckily you came. We could have lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; said Drago on the balcony. He walked down the stairs. &ldquo;Tyson Spade is<em> that</em> powerful, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blaire: &ldquo;We have failed you, master Drago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maxima: &ldquo;Please accept our apologies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forget about it. Leave him to me. I have another assignment for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maxima: &ldquo;As you wish, master.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For now, remain here.&rdquo; Drago went up the stairs and into his room.</p>

<p>Derik walked in front of the students. &ldquo;How incompetent of you. I saw the whole thing. You couldn&rsquo;t even handle one man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blaire held up his fist and yelled, &ldquo;What do you mean by that?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maxima held him back. &ldquo;Now&rsquo;s not the time to let off your anger!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derik: &ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m right. What an embarrassing defeat that was. You call yourselves the students of Drago?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blaire was outraged. &ldquo;Where were you when we were fighting, huh, Derik-san? Hiding in the bushes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trying to change the subject, Blaire? This was <em>your </em>job. Well, I have no time to be arguing with you. What a waste of time that would be.&rdquo; He left.</p>

<p>Blaire: &ldquo;Why that lousy&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Serpent: &ldquo;Show some restraint&#8230;and some respect. After all he&rsquo;s the son of Drago, our master.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maxima: &ldquo;You seem to be forgetting that fact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blaire shrugged Maxima&rsquo;s hands off his arm. &ldquo;Hmph. The only reason he&rsquo;s not getting beat up is because he&rsquo;s the son of our master.&rdquo; He was still angry, but calmed down a bit. He left the room.</p>

<p>A platform from below leveled itself with the floor, filling up the hole. Drago remained kneeling on the platform as it rose to ground level.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The two dimensions have been merged. I must compliment you on a job well done.&rdquo; called out a sinister voice from the darkness.</p>

<p>Drago stood up and bowed. &ldquo;Thank you, sire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The glaring red eyes glowed in the darkness, and the silhouetted figure walked forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the process of merging, the two earths have become one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man, if he is a man at all, wore a black cape and a mask over his face. He has long gray hair that extends down to his shoulders. When he speaks, his voice is full of hatred and despair, and this figure is none other than <strong>Vega</strong>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At long last, my plan seven years ago is being realized. It is a brilliant plan indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is a plan worthy of your greatness.&rdquo; Drago replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because of instability of the inter-dimensional gateway, energy is discharged all over the planet. The earth cannot sustain so much mass, and thus, the land changes and things become dislocated. Cities are scattered and the Earth&rsquo;s military is divided. Now is the best time to take it over. Drago, I trust that you will take care of the Earth warriors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave them up to me. My son and my students are well trained.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good. That is what I like to hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The platform lowered, Drago vanished into the ground with the platform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At last, my dreams will become realized. No longer will I wait in the darkness. The time for victory is now!&rdquo; He stood up and raised his arms in the air. &ldquo;Arise, my dark army! Arise!&rdquo; His words seemed to be heard throughout the whole world. &ldquo;This plan has waited long enough. My soldiers have been scattered all over the world, in disguise as &lsquo;normal&rsquo; human beings. They are brainwashed and don&rsquo;t know who they are. Now they will become themselves again and take over this planet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>People in various places began to transform physically. A man walking on the street suddenly felt great pain and collapsed. People stared at him wordlessly. He got up and screamed wildly. His face was wiped out and he became faceless, his body turned to shades of gray. The people were bewildered by his sudden transformation&#8230; and once he became complete, the dark soldier started attacking the people.</p>

<p>Normal everyday people started to transform and attack the people around them&#8230;it happened everywhere, in public places, buildings, subways; anywhere a dark soldier was present.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now my dark army...take over this planet.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="PF_04_A">04: Derik Appears: Is he Friend or Foe? </span></p></center>


<p>Faith was carrying a basket of clothes that she was planning to wash. There was a small river where small pieces of rocks reside and this is the place where she frequents to do her laundry. Marianna, by chance, was sitting on a log.</p>

<p>She waved at Faith. &ldquo;Hi. How&rsquo;s it going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you doing the laundry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes.&rdquo; She put the basket down and sat next to her friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you do that&#8230;after all that&rsquo;s happened? Aren&rsquo;t you worried?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am worried. But somebody&rsquo;s got to keep the clothes clean, right? Even warriors can&rsquo;t fight in dirty clothes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They laughed heartily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, how are things going with Tyson?&rdquo; Marianna asked, changing the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re doing fine.&rdquo; Faith replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Junior&rsquo;s a cute kid. He must like his father very much, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I guess.&rdquo; Faith replied, smiling. Even though it was a lie, it is better if Marianna does not know. Ignorance is bliss. &ldquo;He likes his grandfather too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So&#8230;being in love must be a great feeling&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could say that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be happy these few years, lucky you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two sat there and looked up at the sky sitting side by side like they used to. When they were children, Faith and Marianna would play in the gardens of the palace and just sit there on a warm summer day and look at clouds and make comments about them. For them, just sitting there in silence is nostalgic.</p>

<p>Today the sky is clear with little clouds. Only days ago, the dimensions were being merged and the sky was dark and stormy, the complete opposite of what it is now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Faith can tell there is something on her friend&rsquo;s mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have something to tell you. Something very important to me. It&rsquo;s like&#8230;if I don&rsquo;t tell someone I&rsquo;ll go crazy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all ears.&rdquo; Faith replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you promise not to laugh at me?&rdquo; Marianna seemed embarrassed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t laugh. Just tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about your brother. I think I&rsquo;m&#8230;&rdquo; Unable to say it, she played with her fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re...?&rdquo; Faith was in suspense, but Mari&rsquo;s hesitation made her impatient.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m...&rdquo; Mari repeated. She was still unable to say it directly.</p>

<p>Faith leaned in close and stared, which made Marianna more uncomfortable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m in love with your brother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It took a second to register those words and Faith&rsquo;s jaw nearly dropped. &ldquo;You...Ace?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must sound crazy&#8230;eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, that&rsquo;s wonderful!&rdquo; she said heartily. Marianna was surprised to hear that. &ldquo;Oh Marianna, you know Ace is not married yet. Believe me, I know you will bring him happiness. I know you very well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The problem is that, well, I don&rsquo;t know if he feels the same about me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&#8230;he doesn&rsquo;t know how you feel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo; She grabbed Faith&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;Faith, will you tell him...for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faye pointed at herself. &ldquo;Me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Please. You&rsquo;re the only one who can tell him.&rdquo; said Mari.<br>  &ldquo;But Marianna, you&rsquo;re the one who has feelings for him. Why should I do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at the grass. &ldquo;I&#8230;I just can&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t know if he feels the same way about me. What if he rejects me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&#8230;you know, you should really tell him. Hiding it all inside won&rsquo;t help anybody. I used to hide my feelings for Tyson, and he did the same, and we only ended up hurting each other. You should just let it all out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, Faith. You are his sister. He will listen to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith let out a sigh. &ldquo;Okay. I will tell him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna was more than grateful. &ldquo;Oh thank you, thank you!&rdquo; She hugged Faith and jumped up and down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just remember, you owe me big time for this.&rdquo; said Faye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. Just name whatever you have in mind.&rdquo; Mari replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will when I think of something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks. You&rsquo;re a real friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith was on her way home from the woods, still carrying the basket of laundry. She was still in disbelief over the bomb that Marianna dropped on her. Ace and Marianna have known each other for a while and they&rsquo;ve been through a lot together, so it was only natural she&rsquo;d develop feelings for him. Still, it was complete surprise to hear it from her own mouth.</p>

<p>Ace is her brother and Mari is her best friend so she&rsquo;s practically family. And her family is about to become even closer. Faith was in a good mood, thinking about how her family will prosper.</p>

<p>Tyson and Junior were not home, so she planned to clean the house. Somebody&rsquo;s got to keep it clean and neat after all. Junior was with Midas and Tyson was with the others, fighting the Dark Society. It&rsquo;s tough being a house wife.</p>

<p>She sensed someone watching her and stopped walking. &ldquo;Come out of there. How long are you going to spy on me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derik jumped off the branch and landed. &ldquo;Very good. I tried not to make a sound, but you knew I was here anyways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith did not bother turning around. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My challenge is still being offered. Why will you not fight me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought I made the reasons clear the last time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derik was persistent and won&rsquo;t take no for an answer. &ldquo;I think you have reasons to fight as well. Am I right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m warning you.&rdquo; Faith replied, still firm in her decision. &ldquo;Stay out of my life. I will get my husband to teach you a lesson if I have to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derik grinded his teeth. &ldquo;How rude you are! Do you know who I am?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know perfectly who you are, a person that doesn&rsquo;t deserve my sympathy. I have nothing more to say to you. And stop following me.&rdquo; She walked away.</p>

<p>Derik&rsquo;s grip tightened on his sword. (Why won&rsquo;t she fight me?!) he thought to himself in frustration.</p>

<p>Faith was glad Derik was gone. Now she can be alone in peace. But she still sensed someone in the trees. Thinking it was Derik, she stopped. &ldquo;I thought I told you to stop following me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blaire landed. Faith was surprised it was some one else. &ldquo;What? Who are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Blaire, first student of Drago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Student of Drago?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to kill you princess!&rdquo; In an instant, Blaire drew his sword and slashed. The basket of clothes dropped on the ground. Faith blocked with her Soul Sword. *Clang*</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will burn you to ashes!&rdquo; He released a thick stream of fire from his palm.</p>

<p>Faith rolled out of its way. The fire burned the grass and turned black. Blaire ran at her and slashed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No stop!&rdquo; yelled Derik. He shot two long, black tentacles at Blaire&rsquo;s sword, blocking his attack.</p>

<p>Blaire looked at him angrily. &ldquo;Derik-san, don&rsquo;t get in my way!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your mission is not to kill her! Leave her alone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; He shot a fireball at Derik.</p>

<p>Derik formed a Spirit Shield and blocked it. Faith charged and slashed, Blaire jumped up and kicked her down. *Whack!*</p>

<p> &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; yelled Derik.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will get in my way for the last time, Derik-san!&rdquo; He charged at his master&rsquo;s son and attacked as if he was the enemy.</p>

<p>Derik blocked with his sword, then jumped away. &ldquo;Stop this, Blaire!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blaire laughed. &ldquo;Derik, son of Drago, is sparing that woman&rsquo;s life? What is she to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derik grunted. &ldquo;I will not allow you to kill her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blaire charged and they slashed at each other. &ldquo;You traitor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re the traitor, Derik-san!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As they fought some more, Derik was being pushed back. Blaire advanced aggressively. He shot a fire beam and Derik blocked it, but he fell down the hill. He rolled and rolled until he reached the bottom.</p>

<p>Blaire stood at the edge. &ldquo;So long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly, a rose hit his back. *Stab!*</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arrgh!&rdquo; He fell on one knee. He pulled the rose out of his back and blood was dripping out of its stem. &ldquo;Damn, I got careless!&rdquo; He looked at Faith, and then jumped away.</p>

<p>Faith ran to the edge. &ldquo;Derik!&rdquo; she screamed over and over. There was no response and she slid down to find him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the heroes traveled into the dangerous and deserted East City. They walked into this deserted street and it was quiet, very quiet. They were uncomfortable with the silence.</p>

<p>Nebula&rsquo;s eyes glanced left and right. &ldquo;Macintosh, are you sure it&rsquo;s here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mac was checking his scanner. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m positive. The scanner says there&rsquo;s an energy crystal around here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t sense anything.&rdquo; Neb replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because the energy crystal has no life force.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace was with the main group as well. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unusually quiet for a Dark Society hideout, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just keep your eyes peeled.&rdquo; Tyson advised.</p>

<p>The heroes continued to walk while keep their eyes sharp. A soldier spied on them from far away. He vanished.</p>

<p>Zelfire&rsquo;s sharp senses somehow caught the spy. &ldquo;Did you guys hear that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;Hear what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could swear I heard something.&rdquo; Zell replied.</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;Are we being watched?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; said Tyson. He suddenly grew very serious.</p>

<p>Soldiers appeared from the building. They approached, getting ready to attack.</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;Looks like they arrived. Let&rsquo;s kick their asses!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The heroes fought the soldiers and of course, they beat them up. Although the heroes were surrounded, it was a short battle. Only one soldier remained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will never let you win!&rdquo; he said. He folded his hands and chanted something. The energy crystal came out of the ground. It was bright red and glowing.</p>

<p>The heroes gasped.</p>

<p>Mac: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the energy crystal!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soldier: &ldquo;Now, steal their energy!&rdquo; The crystal shot four rays, zapping the heroes. &ldquo;Yes, take every last drop of their strength!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The heroes collapsed on their knees and struggled.</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;Damn! This is&#8230;not good!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula screamed and charged. He slashed the crystal into two pieces. Crack! The soldier ran away, but Zelfire jumped and landed in front of him. &ldquo;Hi.&rdquo; He punched the soldier. *Pow!* Now he was surrounded.</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;Alright. There&rsquo;s some things we want to know. And you better tell us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zelfire: &ldquo;Where is Vega?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gasped nervously. &ldquo;I&#8230;I don&rsquo;t know. I swear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give us that nonsense. Tell me now or-&ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I swear on my life! None of the troops know! We were just given orders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;Sounds like he&rsquo;s telling the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;Vega is a lot smarter than last time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derik laid unconscious beside a fire. His head was bandaged and he moaned in pain. He and Faith were on a beach, and the sea was only meters away.</p>

<p>Faith wondered if he was waking up. Derik lifted his head and looked around. He saw a pile of burning wood between him and Faith. It was warm and cozy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You woke up at last. You hit your head pretty badly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faith?&rdquo; He touched his head. &ldquo;You have been watching me all night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yep. You actually did a good thing back there. You saved my life. Thanks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No problem. You getting killed was not part of my goals.&rdquo; He sat up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, was that guy a student of your father?&rdquo;<br>  &ldquo;Yes, and as you can see, we do not get along very well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith observed the fire flies. &ldquo;And you would go against him just so I can live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, yes. I do not want to see you get hurt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Derik, you&rsquo;re different from them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Different from the others. I can tell.&rdquo; There was appreciation and gratitude in her voice. Derik was surprised, because she had always given him the cold shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you get involved in all this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not my nature to kill in cold blood. When I was a child, I had no mother. I never even knew what she looked like. All I had was my father. He taught me all the skills and powers that I know. You see, I cannot go against his wishes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So&#8230;then&#8230;you&rsquo;re forced to fight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I always argued with my father, but he never listened. I have no choice but to obey. But&#8230;I really wanted to challenge you. Nobody told me to do that, only me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&#8230;I see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a long pause, Derik continued the conversation. &ldquo;You know, I think you&rsquo;re special. You&rsquo;re different than other people. I knew that since the first time I saw you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re beautiful, Faith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She blushed and turned away. &ldquo;Why are you telling me this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not let Blaire harm you. I am willing to risk my life for your safety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re different than other women&#8230;I know that, that&#8230;you are special to me.&rdquo; Suddenly, he grabbed her shoulders and she gasped. He kissed her on the lips and kept leaning into her until they both fell down. She shoved him his face away from her. She slapped him good. *Smack!* His face turned red.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You creep!&rdquo; She ran away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She tripped on a rock and fell. &ldquo;Auuh!&rdquo; Her ankle was hurt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, don&rsquo;t go!&rdquo; Derik said desperately.</p>

<p>Faith showed fear and disgust. She just wanted to get away from this place. She got up, forcing her feet to stand, and ran away, limping with every step.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, Faith!&rdquo; He watched her disappear into the woods. Now he regretted what he did. &ldquo;Stupid!&rdquo; He slapped his forehead. &ldquo;Why did you have to go and do that?!&rdquo; he scolded himself.</p>

<p>The heroes returned to the castle, tired and worn out. Midas had already ordered his chefs to prepare dinner. The food looked so good. They were delighted to see the food on the long table.</p>

<p>Midas: &ldquo;Young ones, you must be tired. Let us have dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;Dinner? Gee, I&rsquo;m just reminded that I&rsquo;m hungry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;Me too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;How was your day, Ace? Did you get hurt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not really.&rdquo;<br>  &ldquo;Only a bruise on the face. I just got careless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no! It&rsquo;s swollen. Doesn&rsquo;t it hurt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not anymore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just glad you&rsquo;re alright. Let&rsquo;s eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace nodded.</p>

<p>Everybody was at the table. The room was dark and lighted by only candles. The king sat at the head seat. Closest to him was Junior and Ace. There were all kinds of food and drinks, the best of Almerak. Nebula ate like a pig, not bothering to use forks or spoons.</p>

<p>Midas never stopped smiling. It was such a rare chance to have so many guests at his table. &ldquo;So, then, have you made any progress?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;Well, we are not sure, father. We managed to save East City, but the people have already fled. There was no point in saving it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lisa: &ldquo;What about Vega?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zelfire: &ldquo;We still don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s still alive. We don&rsquo;t know where he is right now&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;Guys, don&rsquo;t worry. We&rsquo;ll find him. We beat him once, right? And we can do it again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s taken many precautions since his defeat. And now with the world the way it is&#8230;how can we stand a chance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Macintosh: &ldquo;How could you, Tyson, of all people say that? There&rsquo;s always a chance!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Junior: &ldquo;They&rsquo;re talking about the bad guys, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How come nobody tells me anything? I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on. Just because I&rsquo;m a kid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, how about I tell you everything after dinner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay, but you have to eat your vegetables.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Awww!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what your mother would&rsquo;ve wanted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson over heard her. &ldquo;Speaking of Faith, she&rsquo;s not here yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas: &ldquo;Oh, she will be here soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door opened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There she is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;Hey! Where were you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just fixing the house, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lisa: &ldquo;We just started. Come on, join us. I saved a seat for you right here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happened to your foot?&rdquo; Tyson asked, noticing the bandages.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh nothing. I just fell. You know I&rsquo;m a klutz.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blaire came back to Skull Mountain, and Maxima and Serpent, who were waiting for him, noticed he didn&rsquo;t just go out for a walk.</p>

<p>Maxima: &ldquo;What happened to your clothes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Derik-san that bastard attacked me!&rdquo; He banged his fist on the wall.</p>

<p>Serpent: &ldquo;Perhaps you disobeyed an order?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for him I would&rsquo;ve killed the princess!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maxima: &ldquo;Our mission is not the princess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?! She is our enemy too. I always hated royalty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Serpent: &ldquo;So, you got into a fight with Derik-san? That is very unwise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have had it with him! He has gotten in my way, always! He always disagrees with me! Unless&#8230;unless&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maxima: &ldquo;Blaire, don&rsquo;t do anything stupid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What Drago doesn&rsquo;t know won&rsquo;t hurt him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Serpent crossed his arms and started to walk away. &ldquo;We are not involved in this. Do what you want. I never heard what you said.&rdquo; He walked into the darkness.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="PF_05_A">05: Drago's Challenge. Do Or Die! </span></p></center>


<p>Derik walked alone in the forest, thinking about what he had done earlier. He sure regretted the way he acted, but he knew at that moment he just couldn&rsquo;t help it. As he got close to Faith he lost control of himself and acted without thinking.</p>

<p>He continued walking. Now he was thinking of how to make up for what he did. <strong>Could</strong>he make it up? How will he ever get her to forgive him? Will she ever forgive him? How could he explain his actions? He kept walking and agonized over his thoughts.</p>

<p>Suddenly, an arrow flew at him and he dodged it just in time. It hit the dirt. Blaire jumped off the branch, screaming as he attacked. Derik looked up and reacted with shock and a gasp. Derik jumped out of the way, the ground exploded as Blaire touched it, and boom! Derik was knocked away!</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this, Blaire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You still don&rsquo;t get it? I am here to repay you for your treachery!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this about Faith? I will not let you harm her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tsk. She did stab me in the back, but that&rsquo;s the least of my concerns now. I hated you since the beginning, Derik-san. Always getting in my way and making excuses for it. It is time to get rid of one nuisance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think you&rsquo;re doing? Have you forgotten who I am?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not. I figured that since your father is so busy, he won&rsquo;t even realize if a son of his is missing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8230;dare&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; He took out a torch and blew into it, and a hurricane of fire rushed at Derik. This was his special, the Hurricane Hell Storm.</p>

<p>Derik dodged it, but a piece of his pants was burned. &ldquo;You traitor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re the traitor. You are helping an enemy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is none of your business. Your job is to execute my father&rsquo;s will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blaire grinned and gave a nasty look. &ldquo;And you call yourself the son of Drago? I don&rsquo;t see how he raised such a brat like you. You must&rsquo;ve been adopted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a disgrace to us, don&rsquo;t you see, Derik-san? Eliminating you is a relief to all of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn you!!&rdquo; Derik put his left arm forward and three black tentacles went for Blaire. He jumped and the tentacles hit the ground. Derik looked up. &ldquo;Uh&#8230;&rdquo; Blaire smiled in the air and as he began to descend, he got ready to do a flying kick. Derik got hit in the chest. Wham! &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha ha! What&rsquo;s the matter? Is that all the son of Drago can do?&rdquo; He shot a fireball.</p>

<p>Derik blocked it and got hurt. He gathered spirit energy and put it into his palms, then released it. Blaire simply jumped to the side and dodged it. Derik charged with his sword and screamed. &ldquo;Yaaahh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blaire blocked it with his sword, and they slashed. *Cling! Clang!*</p>

<p>Derik went back five steps. Blaire advanced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Die!&rdquo; Blaire&rsquo;s sword became surrounded by flames and he slashed.</p>

<p>Derik barely blocked it. Blaire kicked his stomach and he fell. Derik got up, then fell on his knees from the injury. &ldquo;Uhhh&#8230;uhhh&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re finished!&rdquo; Blaire shot a fireball and Derik blocked it with all his might, but it was no use. He was pushed off the cliff. The hill was diagonal and he rolled down, getting scratches and bruises. Derik got up, then ran. Blaire slid down the cliff and chased him, but it was too late to chase him. &ldquo;Damn, he got away. I better find him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derik limped through each step. He knew he was gonna pass out soon, but he had to find a safe place to hide. Luckily enough, he found a house in the middle of the yellow field. He knocked on the door.</p>

<p>Faith answered. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; She gasped in shock to see him. &ldquo;Derik? What&#8230;happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I need&#8230;help.&rdquo; he groaned, and collapsed in front of her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Derik! Derik!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A soldier fell on the floor after being punched by Nebula. The heroes were just finished with a bunch of troops. They were surrounded by beaten up bodies.</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;No energy crystal here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Macintosh checked his scanner. &ldquo;Damn. They must have tricked us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;How is that possible?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somehow they were able to create a fake energy source. The scanner can&rsquo;t tell the difference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;These energy crystals can hide underground, right? Check again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The signal has disappeared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;Looks like they&rsquo;re one step ahead of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zelfire pounded his fist on the ground. &ldquo;This is futile! Vega has hundreds, even thousands of these things all over the world. What difference does it make for us to destroy just a few of them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a point, Zelfire.&rdquo; said Ace. &ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t just do nothing. What else can we do? If we separate, then our chances for survival are much less.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mac: &ldquo;Even if working together is too slow, it is the safer way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;Yeah. We will save one city at a time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Macintosh&rsquo;s cell phone rang. &ldquo;Hello? Lees? What is it?&rdquo; He gave it to Tyson. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello? What&rsquo;s up, Lisa?&rdquo; Two seconds later, he screamed: &ldquo;What?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Nebula inquired, somehow knowing it involved him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our parents are in the hospital!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say what?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derik woke up and moaned. &ldquo;Uhhh...&rdquo; He touched the wound on his head but found bandages instead. The wound was gone. He checked various other wounds on his body like his right hand. It was completely fine even though it was burned by Blaire&rsquo;s fire. His left knee was healed as well, in fact, all his wounds have healed.</p>

<p>Faith came in. &ldquo;Oh, you woke up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this your house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes I live here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derik started to get up, but Faith stopped him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move. You need to rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you. For everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh don&rsquo;t be silly. You don&rsquo;t need to thank me.&rdquo; She heard the kettle whistle. &ldquo;Oh the soup is almost ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your ankle&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s okay. Don&rsquo;t worry about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8230;I&rsquo;m sorry about what I did before&#8230;&rdquo; he said with much difficulty. He was glad he had said it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t mean to right? Accidents happen&#8230;as long as you know you&rsquo;re wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uh&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went back to the kitchen. Derik was dumbfounded. How did his wounds heal? He could not have been asleep for more than a day. Does Faith have magical healing powers? What&rsquo;s more pressing on his mind is her attitude. It looks like she&rsquo;s forgiven him already and the incident from the other day never happened. He still felt guilty about her bruised ankle, it was his fault that she fell.</p>

<p>He looked around the room. It was cozy and comfortable. So this is the place where she and Tyson lives, he thought.</p>

<p>Faith put the spoon into the soup, stirring it and tasting it. It was almost perfect, just needs more salt, she thought.</p>

<p>As Derik sat there, he stared at Faith. Nobody was here except them. If something happened, nobody would know&#8230;He let himself be controlled by his evil thoughts. He got up and went into the kitchen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The soup isn&rsquo;t ready yet. Stay in the bedroom, okay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In one stroke, he put his hand over her mouth and nose and his other arm wrapped themselves around her neck. She struggled to get free...she was caught by surprise and she was losing breath. Her struggling ended when she fainted and fell into Derik&rsquo;s arms.</p>

<p>Tyson and Nebula grieved over their parents as the doctor was examining them. &ldquo;They will survive.&rdquo; he announced vaguely. Then he left the room.</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;Mother&#8230;father&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way the soldiers could have done this. It must have been Drago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or Vega.&rdquo; Suddenly, Tyson sensed something. &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; he said to himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is what?&rdquo; Nebula asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing. You just stay here!&rdquo; Tyson said, rushing to the stairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, huh?&rdquo; Nebula did not believe his brother nor did he listen to him.</p>

<p>Tyson ran up the stairs like it&rsquo;s the end of the world. He reached the door and pushed it hard like it was a nuisance in the way. He ran to the center of the roof and stopped. Drago was floating three feet off the floor, and he landed.</p>

<p>Drago: &ldquo;Nice to meet you again, Tyson Spade. How is the family?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;You &ndash; what do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Relax. I did not come for a fight. Instead, I am here to offer you a challenge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A challenge?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I challenge you, Tyson Spade to a duel to the death!&rdquo; he said, pointing at the hero. &ldquo;Well, what do you say? Do you accept?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, then, this will end this once and for all. Alright, I accept.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drago was delighted. &ldquo;Ah, just what I expected from you. A true warrior indeed. I am glad you didn&rsquo;t take the coward&rsquo;s way out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to be scared of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I shall see you two days from now, meet me in the Meridian Forest at dawn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to regret this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drago ascended to the air and disappeared. Tyson watched him leave, feeling no regret. He looked behind.</p>

<p>Nebula was there and he looked shocked. &ldquo;Tyson&#8230;what have you done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you accept his challenge before even thinking it through?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no need to think about it. Killing Drago will bring us one step closer to victory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It could be a trap...no it&rsquo;s definitely a trap.&rdquo; Nebula was right on the mark. Between the two of them, he was the only rational one at this time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been through many traps. And we&rsquo;re still alive today, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re out of your mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody has to pay for what happened to our parents!&rdquo; Tyson exclaimed, clenching a fist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you think you can do all this by yourself? What if you lose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One tries not to think what happens when he loses a match.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re out of your mind.&rdquo; Neb repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if he challenged you? Would you accept it, or not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula didn&rsquo;t answer, he only made a face.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="PF_06_A">06: The Prince's New Love. Stop Derik Now! </span></p></center>


<p>&ldquo;What?! Faith is missing?&rdquo; Tyson shouted at the top of his lungs. The sound echoed throughout the throne room.</p>

<p>Ace put a finger over his lips. &ldquo;Shhh. Keep it down. We do not want the others to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you guys supposed to be watching her?&rdquo; Nebula asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She always stayed at the house. She didn&rsquo;t want any of us to disturb her. After I have not heard from her in half a day, I decided to go visit her, but she was not there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were there signs of a struggle?&rdquo; Tyson asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somewhat. Stuff was all over the floor.&rdquo; Ace replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn&#8230;it&rsquo;s the work of the Dark Society. I&rsquo;ll bring her back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By yourself?&rdquo; Nebula asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! Don&rsquo;t come with me. Oh, and don&rsquo;t tell Junior about this. He&rsquo;ll be worried.&rdquo; He ran towards the balcony and jumped off, then soared into the sky.</p>

<p>Nebula sighed. &ldquo;Always doing things by himself. Oh well, I guess I gotta go too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any place but here. It&rsquo;s boring.&rdquo; He flew out the window.</p>

<p>Acelot was now alone. Nobody was there but him. Just him and the big, empty room. He leaned against the column and went into deep thought. Marianna and Junior were in the bedroom, chatting about something. Midas was planting seeds in the garden. Macintosh was working on his scanner. Zelfire trained in the woods. Everybody was doing their own thing. Ace didn&rsquo;t feel a bit of &lsquo;working together&rsquo; or &lsquo;teamwork&rsquo; around this group of people. The only time they were together was fighting, and even during the fighting, cooperation was rare.</p>

<p>Bored, he stared at the golden locket and flashbacked to a moment just before Faith was gone.</p>

<p>Ace was leaning against a column as usual. Faith was also leaning on the same column on the opposite side.</p>

<p>Faith broke the silence. &ldquo;Acelot, I have something to tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; Ace has no idea that his sister was about to drop a bomb on him. He thought she was going to mention something casual.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&#8230;I don&rsquo;t know how to say it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spit it out.&rdquo; Being a traveling since he was a kid, Ace has no patient whatsoever. And he&rsquo;s lived on the streets since he was a child so his manners are lacking and his words are rough. Needless to say, he does not talk like a prince at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to take it the wrong way&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Acelot&rsquo;s patient was running thin. &ldquo;Sis, you&rsquo;re not making any sense. Just tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&#8230;about Marianna.&rdquo; She was opposite of her brother. She was well mannered and rarely cursed if ever, and always spoke politely. Around the topic of feelings, it is a particularly sensitive subject for women.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What of her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, well&#8230;um, uh, how do you&#8230;how do you feel about h-her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind of question is that?&rdquo; Acelot is a very straightforward man, but around a topic like this, he has no clue. As one can tell he does not have experience with relationships and doesn&rsquo;t know how to handle the subject well.</p>

<p>Clearly he didn&rsquo;t understand her question, so she went direct. &ldquo;Do you like her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. She&rsquo;s a very good friend. She has been very kind to me these few years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it&#8230;she is just a friend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah. So?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I wanted to say was&#8230;&rdquo; After a few seconds of silence, she spilled it out: &ldquo;She wants to be more than a friend to you!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; Ace said, moving from his spot. &ldquo;You are not making any sense, sis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You still don&rsquo;t get it! She cares about you!&rdquo; At this point, Faith was getting frustrated as well. Her question was direct enough, wasn&rsquo;t it? How much more direct can she be?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I care about her too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But is it the same way that she cares about you? Haven&rsquo;t you noticed? Even a little bit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Acelot&rsquo;s eyes widened. He finally understood what she meant by &lsquo;more than a friend.&rsquo; &ldquo;You mean&#8230;Wait...that is not possible. How do you know this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just know. It&rsquo;s a woman&rsquo;s intuition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to say...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised you didn&rsquo;t know. You spent so much time with Marianna and you have no idea? Whether you believe me or not, it&rsquo;s true Ace. Just find out for yourself.&rdquo; Faith walked away from the column. For an unknown reason, she felt agitated after telling him the truth. Maybe it&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s too much of a blockhead to know a woman&rsquo;s feelings. Maybe it&rsquo;s that his reaction wasn&rsquo;t what Faith wanted. Whatever it is, she just could not say another word to him.</p>

<p>Tyson flew over the ocean, trying to sense Faith. &ldquo;Where is she? I can&rsquo;t sense her life force&#8230;this is not good.&rdquo; He tried harder and harder, focusing all of his mental energy to picture her face. Still, it was no use. Maybe she&rsquo;s unconscious.</p>

<p>Water dripped from a leak and fell on Faith&rsquo;s forehead. Faith moaned and opened her eyes half way. She was in an unfamiliar place &ndash; inside a cave. Faith turned her head. She was resting on something hard; it wasn&rsquo;t the ground, but a rectangular rock that was shaped like a bed.</p>

<p>(Where am I?) Another drop of water fell on her head. She looked up. The ceiling had a small crack and light showed. Vines covered the ceiling and wall. (How did I get here? Now I remember&#8230;it was Derik.) She tried to get up, but was too weak to do any more than lifting her head.</p>

<p>Derik came in. &ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re awake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this? What do you think you&rsquo;re doing by keeping me here?&rdquo;<br>  &ldquo;You will not be leaving from here. I guarantee that. Just stay here and be good.&rdquo; He exited the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Derik, Derik, don&rsquo;t do this!&rdquo; she yelled. He was already gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?!&rdquo; Tyson said, feeling something. It was so short and brief, but that instinct that lasted for a second was so strong he knew it was Faith. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s her!&rdquo; He tried to pinpoint the location of the ki and discovered that she&rsquo;s in a mountain. A mountain not far away, and that&rsquo;s good because he didn&rsquo;t have to fly far. He increased his speed, using up his energy.</p>

<p>In Town Square, an explosion was heard and people screamed and then panicked. People ran in all directions and pushed each other as things keep exploding. Maxima and Graveller stood next to each other, watching the people run.</p>

<p>Maxima smiled and laughed. &ldquo;Look at them cowards. None of them deserves to live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Graveller crush!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There will be plenty of time for that, Graveller. Our goal is to lure out our enemies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enemies?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maxima: &ldquo;Yes, our enemies. The ones we met in the castle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Graveller crush them all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed we will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just two blocks away, the heroes have arrived, noticing the chaotic scene.</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;What is going on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;Somebody is attacking?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They saw an explosion. &ldquo;Look, over there!&rdquo; said Zelfire. The three of them ran towards the smoke.</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the students of Drago!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;So you caused all this trouble. I should&rsquo;ve known.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maxima: &ldquo;Well, well, well, look what showed up. Look Graveller, they came here to give away their worthless lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Graveller: &ldquo;Me crush them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will, indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The heroes charged. A bunch of soldiers showed up and attacked. Ace drew his sword and started slashing. Marianna charged directly at Maxima. Graveller got in her way and she gasped. Maxima smiled. &ldquo;Kill her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna punched his chest. *Bump.* No effect. Graveller punched down, Marianna jumped and his fist hit the ground and smashed a hole. Marianna landed and observed carefully. She had to think of how to defeat the monster.</p>

<p>Zelfire fought his way through the soldiers, then went for Graveller. The rock man punched him into the wall like he was a sand bag. Ace went for Maxima, who blocked with her daggers. They slashed each other.</p>

<p>Marianna shot an arrow and Graveller caught it. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; she said in shock.</p>

<p>Graveller pounded the ground and it cracked. Marianna jumped out of the way as rocks broke apart.</p>

<p>Marianna and Ace stood back to back. Their enemies were on both sides, ready to strike at any given moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get them.&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; replied Ace.</p>

<p>The enemies attacked. Ace kept on slashing his sword on Graveller, and every time it didn&rsquo;t hurt him. Ace jumped and drew the sword back, screamed, and chopped Graveller&rsquo;s head. It went about an inch deep, then the sword went no further. The rock monster was not hurt. Ace opened his mouth in shock. With the sword still in its head, Graveller punched Ace against the brick wall. Wham!</p>

<p>Marianna and Maxima slashed each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your days of messing with this world are over!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maxima: &ldquo;Wrong! This world now belongs to Vega and only Vega.&rdquo; She attacked with her daggers.</p>

<p>They continued slashing, and neither was able to hit each other&rsquo;s body. Suddenly, Maxima threw one of the daggers at her. Marianna ducked, then suddenly Maxima charged at her and stabbed her chest. Blood gushed out and Marianna collapsed.</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;NO!!&rdquo; He kicked Graveller away, then attacked Maxima viciously.</p>

<p>Maxima jumped back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You alright, Marianna?&rdquo; Ace asked, bending down.</p>

<p>Zelfire got in front of them. Then Nebula and Macintosh came.</p>

<p>Maxima: &ldquo;Looks like our assault ends here, Graveller. Let us go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They flew away.</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;The nerve of them. I swear I will kill them the next time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna pressed her hand firmly on the bleeding wound. &ldquo;Uhh&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marianna! Marianna!&rdquo; shouted Ace. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be alright!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ace&#8230;&rdquo; she moaned weakly.</p>

<p>Zelfire: &ldquo;We gotta get her to your lab, Mac!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have to hang on Marianna! You&rsquo;ll be alright!&rdquo; Ace shouted, and tears dripped down his face.</p>

<p>Marianna was shocked and her eyes widened. &ldquo;Ace&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t die, please.&rdquo; He wiped his tears.</p>

<p>Tyson found a mountain. He was floating in air, and in front of him was a hole in which he believed where Faith was. He went in and walked deeper inside. He was very angry and upset.</p>

<p>Derik: &ldquo;I will never let you go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith gasped. &ldquo;Tyson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? Did you say Tyson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Faith?!&rdquo; Tyson shouted as he came in.</p>

<p>Derik: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out of my way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Derik, spreading out his arms. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let anybody take her from me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out of my way.&rdquo; Tyson repeated angrily. He was determined to get Faith back no matter what the cost. He was still fresh with anger over what happened to his parents and let&rsquo;s say that killing wasn&rsquo;t out of the question. &ldquo;This is your last warning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Derik did not move. &ldquo;Make me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson gave him what he asked for, a good punch in the stomach. *Wham!* Derik&rsquo;s back slammed against the wall and blood dripped out his mouth. &ldquo;Ughh&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson went towards Faith. She was overjoyed to see him. &ldquo;Tyson&#8230;you made it&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She nodded. He lifted her and carried her in his arms. He turned around, went past Derik without looking at him, and left the cave.</p>

<p>Derik got up, limping, with one hand on his wound. He was in shock of how strong that punch was.</p>

<p>He remembered exactly how Tyson&rsquo;s eyes looked when he said get out of the way. Those eyes were the eyes of love and of hate. So, that was Faith&rsquo;s husband, he thought. He&rsquo;s strong, no doubt about it, and also a good man. Now he knew why Faith loved him. He felt ashamed and helpless, and even regretted what he did. Now he was wondering why he kidnapped her in the first place. Could he have really kept her from Tyson?</p>

<p>Ace and Marianna walked on the fields outside of the castle, holding hands. They looked at each other shyly and continued walking. Then they saw two people land from the sky.</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Tyson and my sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;He brought her back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson gently put Faith on the ground. &ldquo;I think you should stick around with the others. It&rsquo;s safer that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson began to leave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace and Marianna was just about to greet them, then they stopped and watched.</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;I have to duel with Drago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drago? Are you crazy? You will fight him by yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I already promised him I would go. It is something I must do. Once he&rsquo;s gone, we will be one step closer to victory!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t go! What if it&rsquo;s a trap?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if so, I have to go. I can&rsquo;t just stay here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dangerous, Tyson! He could turn our son against us. I can&rsquo;t imagine what else he can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to go. No matter what you say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith got in his way. &ldquo;Please, don&rsquo;t go!&rdquo; she said with tears.</p>

<p>Ace and Marianna were shocked.</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;Faith&#8230;don&rsquo;t make this any harder than it has to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let you go! I won&rsquo;t let you leave!&rdquo; she yelled.</p>

<p>Deep down inside, Tyson knew that she really cared about him. But he had to duel Drago for the sake of all. He smiled. &ldquo;Alright. I&rsquo;ll stay with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith was too happy to notice it was too good to be true. &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah. Let&rsquo;s go inside the castle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He put his arm around her shoulder and they walked. Suddenly, Tyson made a karate chop on her back and she fell unconscious on the ground. Wham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo; he whispered.</p>

<p>Ace ran towards them. &ldquo;What did you do that for?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;Acelot, Marianna, take care of Faith for me, okay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They stared at him in shock.</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to go, no matter what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I have to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;You better come back. Alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure thing.&rdquo; He flew away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a brave man he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;Now I finally see why Faith loves him so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;Yeah. But I don&rsquo;t know if she&rsquo;s lucky or unlucky.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="PF_07_A">07: I Accept Your Duel...Drago's Secret Weapon </span></p></center>


<p>Marianna got injured fighting Maxima and Graveller, and Ace, who was overwhelmed to see his loved one come close to death, burst to tears. The couple revealed their feelings and became a real couple at last. Meanwhile, an older couple, Tyson and Faith, had some problems. Faith wouldn&rsquo;t allow Tyson to fight Drago in a death match, but he had already promised to go. He said he wouldn&rsquo;t go, but he did anyway. Was Nebula right, could it be a trap?</p>

<p>Tyson flew into the woods and landed, then traveled the rest of the way on foot. Ten seconds later he saw Drago, standing there, crossing his arms, smiling. His black cape waved from being blown by the soft wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, you showed up at last, Tyson Spade. I am glad you did not chicken out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always keep my word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I expected nothing less from a Sayan warrior such as yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get this over with, can we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson got ready. He got into the alert stance, a position where he holds his fists in front of him and bends his knees. This was the best stance for starting a fight, it&rsquo;s good in offense and defense.</p>

<p>Drago just stared at him. &ldquo;Fool. Did you really think you can defeat Vega?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I defeated him seven years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So what? That was seven years ago, as you said. Things have changed since then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson smiled. &ldquo;I will not let him succeed! I have already fought your students Drago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh don&rsquo;t worry, Tyson Spade, I promise you will not be disappointed. Let me tell you, using magical powers isn&rsquo;t my only asset. I have physical strength as well, just like yours.&rdquo; He got ready. <br>  The warriors charged at the same time and punched. Drago gave it all he got in that punch and Tyson ducked. Now Drago was vulnerable to an attack, and one and a half seconds was more than enough for Tyson, he punched Drago&rsquo;s stomach really hard. He spit saliva and tumbled backwards. Tyson jumped and kicked Drago&rsquo;s face. Whack! He fell on the ground hard.</p>

<p>Drago got up and Tyson charged and attacked non-stop. Drago dodged his punches, but couldn&rsquo;t find the chance to retaliate. Tyson hit with his knee, Drago blocked with both hands. The wizard got pushed back from the force, and his feet scraped against the ground. Tyson punched his face. Pow! Then he kicked the wizard in the stomach. Wham! Drago fell on one knee, then quickly leaped and punched. Tyson blocked wit his palm. Tyson pushed his fist away, then punched him. Pow!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so funny? Didn&rsquo;t I hit you enough?&rdquo; asked Tyson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think you&rsquo;ve won, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; He wiped the blood off his mouth. &ldquo;Let me tell you something, you have already lost! You lost the second you accepted the challenge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know everything there is to know about you, Tyson. And you know nothing about me. I&rsquo;ve been watching you and studying your moves. I know all of your combat styles and techniques.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson grunted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Did you really think you can defeat some one as powerful as I am?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson closed his eyes and smiled. &ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think you know me, Drago, but you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a technique I haven&rsquo;t used in a while. And you haven&rsquo;t seen it yet. It&rsquo;s going to blow you away!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What technique? Nothing you do can affect the outcome!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s called the Super Sayan. Watch!&rdquo; Tyson powered up and transformed. Drago watched in shock. Energy waves covered him. Tyson&rsquo;s muscles got bigger and veins popped up. The air around him was blown away, and Drago felt it. Tyson&rsquo;s hair turned golden yellow and a flash of gold energy appeared. Drago was almost blinded by that light and he covered his eyes. Finally, the transformation was complete.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8230;what is this power?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is what is a Super Sayan, something you have never seen before. My power and speed have increased several times than in my normal state.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will show you what is real power!&rdquo; Drago charged and punched. Pow! He punched Tyson&rsquo;s face. To his surprise, Tyson did not show signs of pain. He just stared at him with the fist in his face. Drago released his fist, then stepped back in shock. &ldquo;No&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson punched him and he fell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not over yet.&rdquo; Drago folded his hands and closed his eyes and began to power up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this? A spiritual barrier?&rdquo;</p>

<p>White, clear energy surrounded Drago in the form of a bubble. He began to chant a spell and the energy increased.</p>

<p>Tyson waited whatever was coming. Drago gathered that energy into his hands and released it as a ball. Zoom! Tyson was hit and knocked away. &ldquo;He&#8230;broke my shield!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drago prepared to use the same move, forming spiritual energy around himself. &ldquo;If you did not like that, then you are going to hate this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drago fired the ball, Tyson countered with the Energy Blast beam. Boom!</p>

<p>Tyson appeared and punched Drago in the face. They jumped around and hit each other, while Tyson was faster he kept hitting Drago from all directions, appearing all over the place. Wham! Whack!</p>

<p>They landed on the ground. Drago folded his hands and began to chant something that made no sense to Tyson. It was in another language. Spirit waves were produced from his body as he chanted the spell.</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;What is he doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly, four energy crystals came from the ground, and Tyson was surrounded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, crystals drain his energy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo; Tyson flew into the air, and the crystals followed him, like he was a magnet. &ldquo;I thought this was supposed to be a fight! You cheater!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drago: &ldquo;I never said this was not allowed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crystals zapped, Tyson dodged. He flew very fast, hoping to get rid of them, but they tailed him closely. When they were catching up, Tyson changed direction and went in curves. The crystals separated their paths and charged at him. He dodged them as they charged with the sharp point in front.</p>

<p>Drago, on the ground, controlled the crystals&rsquo; movements with his hands. Suddenly, the crystals surrounded Tyson. He looked at them. They zapped him together and he screamed. &ldquo;Ahhhhh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wizard smiled and watched enjoyably as Tyson suffered.</p>

<p>The Super Sayan had enough. He kept on screaming at the top of his lungs and powered up, and the resulting energy burst shattered the crystals. Crack!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impressive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You tricks won&rsquo;t work on me, Drago!&rdquo; Tyson flew diagonally down and charged at his enemy.</p>

<p>The wizard flew up and blocked his punch. Pow! Then he jammed his knee into Tyson&rsquo;s stomach. Wham! Then he grabbed Tyson&rsquo;s arms and turned him upside down, then threw him away. Tyson fell into the trees and then crashed through a few branches, and finally hit the ground.</p>

<p>Drago jumped from tree to tree and appeared near Tyson. The Super Sayan got up and prepared himself for another round.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take this!&rdquo; he yelled, and charged.</p>

<p>Drago jumped and went behind Tyson, his feet hit the tree, and he bounced off the tree and charged forward with his fist. Tyson turned around and blocked it. It all happened within seconds. Drago&rsquo;s fist was just millimeters from Tyson&rsquo;s nose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You almost got me. Nice try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drago smiled evilly. &ldquo;Got you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drago opened his palm and glittery sand went into Tyson&rsquo;s eyes. He screamed and rubbed his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahhhh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drago jumped back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8230;what have you done to me?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are going to get it now. I have just spread my sleeping sand on you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;Sleeping sand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is correct. Whoever comes in contact with it will fall asleep within seconds. This is a technique I am very proud of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&#8230;fair!&rdquo; Tyson felt himself getting weaker, and sleepier. It wasn&rsquo;t an ordinary kind of sleepiness. His eyes refused to stay open, and he forced them to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All resistance is futile! Even the strongest of warriors will fall under my spell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must not let it take over me&#8230;must fight it&#8230;&rdquo; His vision became blurry and his legs trembled. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; In a flash he thought about all his loved ones. &ldquo;Must not lose&#8230;I must fight&#8230;&rdquo; It was no use. He fell on his knees, then his face touched the ground. He went from Super Sayan back to normal. &ldquo;&#8230;I think I&rsquo;ll take a nap first.&rdquo; His eyes closed.</p>

<p>Drago laughed and his voice echoed. &ldquo;Ha ha ha ha ha ha! It does not matter how strong you are. No one can resist my sorcery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula: (Tyson&rsquo;s life force has disappeared. I can no longer sense his presence.) He made a grim face (Does that mean&#8230;no, I refuse to believe that.)</p>

<p>Faith suddenly woke up with sweat all over. Her neck hurt like hell and she touched it. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Tyson?&rdquo; was the first thing she said.</p>

<p>Marianna, who was sitting besides her, quickly grabbed her shoulders. &ldquo;Calm down. You just woke up. Don&rsquo;t move around so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is he? He didn&rsquo;t go to fight Drago, did he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna did not answer.</p>

<p>Faith grabbed Marianna&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;Tell me! Did he go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has he come back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&#8230;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith let go of her best friend, then stared at the bed. &ldquo;I know he is still alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. As long as we believe in him, he will not leave us. Take some rest, my friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith lied down, and her friend adjusted the blanket for her. Faith turned sideways towards the window, with her back to Marianna. Marianna closed the door gently. Ace was waiting outside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is she taking it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="PF_08_A">08: The Search...Where in the World is Tyson Spade? </span></p></center>


<p>Drago proved to be a tricky and powerful opponent as Tyson found out he had a few tricks up his sleeve. Tyson fought to the end, unfortunately not even the Super Sayan could resist the wizard&rsquo;s sleeping sand. What will happen now?</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;Are you going to see Faith?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; answered Marianna. She was holding a tray of food, and no doubt it was for her friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then good luck. I tried to talk to her but it was no use.&rdquo; He sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s taking it pretty bad, huh? You just need to take the right approach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna knocked politely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming in, Faith. Okay?&rdquo; There was no answer and she went in anyway. She closed the door gently behind her.</p>

<p>Faith was facing the window, sitting on the bed. She was completely silent.</p>

<p>Marianna set the tray on the adjacent table. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you hungry? You haven&rsquo;t eaten in a whole day. Try some. Don&rsquo;t you miss royal food?&rdquo; Still no response. Marianna got one of the pieces of meat and ate it. &ldquo;Mmmm, it&rsquo;s delicious. Don&rsquo;t you want some?&rdquo; she said, as if Faith was a kid.</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>Marianna couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go on like this!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tyson&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We all miss Tyson!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tyson&#8230;I want to see him now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know where he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine then. I will leave. The food is right here. Tyson wouldn&rsquo;t want to see you like this, if he was here.&rdquo; She left and slammed the door. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even say it.&rdquo; she said to Ace, who she knew was just about to say &lsquo;I told you so.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;You had no luck too? I guess the only one left who can really help her is her son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inside the room, Faith&rsquo;s eyes filled with tears as she thought about her lover. &ldquo;Tyson&#8230;where are you? Tyson&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas got up when he saw his son and Marianna enter the room. &ldquo;How is she?&rdquo; he asked worriedly.</p>

<p>Acelot sighed. &ldquo;Not so well, father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;She seems to be in denial. She won&rsquo;t eat anything&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe Junior can help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Junior was being trained by Nebula. While they were hitting each other, Acelot interrupted them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; Junior answered after Marianna explained everything to him. They were walking through the hallway and stopped at Faith&rsquo;s room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; Marianna said, &ldquo;Mommy isn&rsquo;t feeling so well because daddy isn&rsquo;t here. She needs some one to comfort her. Only you can do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna opened the door cautiously. &ldquo;Hey Faith, guess who&rsquo;s here to see you? Why, it&rsquo;s your son!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Junior went in. &ldquo;Mom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith didn&rsquo;t even turn around to look at him. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you feeling well? Is it because you miss father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Of course I do. I knew him longer than you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it, mommy. He&rsquo;ll come back&#8230;soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re with them, aren&rsquo;t you? Did Marianna tell you to say this&amp;amp;gt;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Junior got nervous and panicked. &ldquo;Uhhh&#8230;uhh&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you acting like this? I don&rsquo;t like it when you&rsquo;re like this. Why? Is it because of father. You still have me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;You never liked your father, did you? I never saw you once show him any respect. And I tried to ignore it, but now I cannot anymore. You are a disgrace as my son!! Get out of my sight! Out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But nothing! Get out of my sight!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Junior ran out crying. Ace tried to grab him but Junior ignored everybody and kept running. He barged into the room. &ldquo;What the heck is wrong with you? He was just trying to help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tears dripped from Faith&rsquo;s eyes. Ace just regretted what he said. &ldquo;Sis&#8230;don&rsquo;t be like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All I need is Tyson. No one else! Leave me alone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace left, slowly closing the door.</p>

<p>Back at the throne room, the heroes grieved over the loss of Tyson. However, some of them still believed that he was still alive, whether he won or not.</p>

<p>Zelfire: &ldquo;Tyson&rsquo;s life force has faded away. I cannot sense him any longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lisa: &ldquo;I know he&rsquo;s still alive. I just know it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Macintosh: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Until we find a body&#8230;I refuse to accept the fact that he&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;What a guy&#8230;I knew it was dangerous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zell: &ldquo;He accepted the duel knowing the risks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Nebula said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame him. If I was in his place I would&rsquo;ve accepted it too. He had too much to protect. He had to protect us. The pride of the warrior is within him, and I can see it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas: &ldquo;Whatever happened out there, we all know he did his best. May the Spirit have mercy on him&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Acelot went back to his sister&rsquo;s room, hoping to make success this time. &ldquo;Hey, sis-&ldquo; He froze when nobody was there. The bed was empty. The curtain blew from the wind. &ldquo;Faith?&rdquo; He ran towards the window. He looked around the room, and confirmed that she ran away. &ldquo;Faith has run away!&rdquo; he yelled, running into the throne room.</p>

<p>Everybody stared at him dumbfounded. &ldquo;Say what?&rdquo; Marianna shouted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone! I checked her room, and she wasn&rsquo;t there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mac: &ldquo;No, she wouldn&rsquo;t be that foolish&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;Yes. I think it&rsquo;s pretty obvious where she went.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zelfire: &ldquo;We gotta find her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;Yeah. We don&rsquo;t want to lose her too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith, holding the Soul Sword tightly in her grip, jumped through the forest. This method was faster than running, but took more energy to perform. Eventually, she found what she was looking for.</p>

<p>Drago smiled as he watched Tyson&rsquo;s slumber. &ldquo;Pity. All this time he thought he could win against my black magic.&rdquo; He sensed some one coming from. &ldquo;Hmmm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>*Slash!* He leaped away. Faith&rsquo;s sword hit the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, well, what do we have here? It is a pleasure to meet you, Princess Faith of Almerak! I guess that title is meaningless now that Almerak is destroyed. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;What have you done to Tyson?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The same thing I will do to you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let you win!&rdquo; She charged and slashed.</p>

<p>Drago jumped out of the way, leaving her to hit a boulder. &ldquo;That is the same attitude your husband had, and look at him now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith screamed and slashed, Drago dodged. &ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; He held a fist and waved his hand in an arc. Tiny sparkles of light were thrown at Faith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this?!&rdquo; Her eyes winced as the sand got to her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing but one of my most deadly techniques &ndash; the sleeping sand!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sleeping sand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have a good sleep!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&#8230;I must fight it&#8230;&rdquo; Faith did try, but all efforts were wasted. She could barely walk, even stand on her feet. She collapsed. Even on the ground, she crawled. Her eyes closed without permission and she fell asleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pleasant dreams.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="PF_09_A">09: Dream World. They Meet Again... </span></p></center>


<p>Now both Tyson and Faith have fallen under Drago&rsquo;s sleeping spell, and were completely at his mercy. Will he kill them, and without them, how will Vega be defeated?</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Marianna shouted in surprise. &ldquo;Faith is&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone! I checked her room, and she wasn&rsquo;t there.&rdquo; Ace repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, she wouldn&rsquo;t be that foolish&#8230;&rdquo; said Macintosh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I think it&rsquo;s pretty obvious where she went.&rdquo; said Nebula.</p>

<p>Zelfire: &ldquo;We gotta find her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;Yeah. We don&rsquo;t want to lose her too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas entered the room. &ldquo;Then let us waste no time. If you must find her, then you must hurry. Every second you are outside of the castle you are in danger. Each of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;My father is right. We will separate and look for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas: &ldquo;No my son, you stay here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But father-&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not want to lose another child of mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;It is better this way. You all should go. Me and Acelot will stay here and protect the castle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zelfire: &ldquo;Good idea. Okay, let&rsquo;s get moving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Macintosh: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find your sister. Don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah. That&rsquo;s if she&rsquo;s alive.&rdquo; said Ace gloomily.</p>

<p>At once, the heroes left the castle in search of their friend.</p>

<p>The three remaining ones hoped for the best. Midas, sitting on his royal chair, began to break into a sweat. (My daughter&#8230;why are you so foolish?)</p>

<p>Lisa was hiding behind the side door the whole time. (I can&rsquo;t believe Faith ran away like that. What could she have been thinking! She knows we care about her too, doesn&rsquo;t she?) She leaned on the wall. (Stupid. Leaving us like that won&rsquo;t bring Tyson back.)</p>

<p>Marianna suddenly gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Mari?&rdquo; Ace asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Junior doesn&rsquo;t know yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yeah. It is better that he does not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&#8230;how will we tell him? What will we say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We say nothing.&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&#8230;&rdquo; She disagreed completely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We cannot let him know about this. He is just a kid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think he will realize it eventually! You all are trying to hide things from him. I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is for his own good, Mari. Please, listen to me.&rdquo; He touched her shoulders. &ldquo;He must not know. Do not tell him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked to the side, emotionally troubled.</p>

<p>Inside Skull Mountain, Tyson and Faith laid asleep. They were on rock pillars next to each other. Drago stood behind them, waving his hand over the crystal ball. The room was dark and empty. The crystal ball began to emit a light, and it lighted the whole room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With you two asleep nobody will be able to stop my plans. But I will not kill you yet. I must learn more about this emotion called love. If their love was able to defeat Vega, then no matter how what the others say about love, it is something worth investigating. I must find more about this special type of power. If love is the key to ultimate power, then I shall have it!&rdquo; He put his hands around the crystal ball but didn&rsquo;t touch it. Tyson and Faith&rsquo;s bodies were glowing, and waves of spirit energy traveled from bottom to top. They moaned and their eyes moved. &ldquo;I will send you to another world, a dream world unaffected by the influences of reality. This way, I will find out more about love. Dream&#8230;&rdquo; Drago&rsquo;s spell was cast and they were powerless to resist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is my daughter?&rdquo; demanded the king. &ldquo;I want her found now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, but your majesty-&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Insolent!&rdquo; yelled the old man. &ldquo;I want no excuses! Find her now! Do not rest until she is found!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, your majesty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>News of the princess&rsquo;s disappearance traveled throughout the castle quickly. The king did not care, as long as the bad news does not reach outside of the castle. Since his daughter ran away, he was in a grumpy mood, and none of his advisors or friends could cheer him up. He ate very little and scorned everyone whether they did the right thing or not.</p>

<p>In the Kingdom of Almerak, there were many kinds of people. But they could be thought of as two groups of people, the rich and the poor. The poor are jealous of the rich, the rich scorn the poor. Life for the lower class was not easy, especially if they have no resources. One such job that peasants had was farming. Farmers buy land and grow crops on the land, hoping to get some money. Usually they go into debt and have to sell part of their profits to pay for the land.</p>

<p>Two silhouetted figures on the field were working. The father and son were holding shovels, digging into the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tyson, Terry, dinner is ready!&rdquo; yelled a woman&rsquo;s voice from the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be right there, Margrit!&rdquo; Terry yelled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay, mom!&rdquo; replied Tyson.</p>

<p>The Spade family was one of those poor families who farmed for a living. Financially troubled, their only source of money was farming. They had ragged clothes and learned to like it. All Margrit ever wanted was to wear a beautiful dress like those rich people. But with the money they had they could never afford a dress like that, not even one. Terry wished that his clan would become the greatest one in the world, so that they can have fame and fortune. Tyson also wanted to be rich, being taught that money is everything since he was little.</p>

<p>Father and son threw their shovels on the ground carelessly and went into the house. Dinner time was their favorite part of the day, especially after a day of hard work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, how much have you men earned today?&rdquo; Margrit asked, setting the dishes on the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only four silver pieces.&rdquo; answered Terry, taking out a small bag of the money.</p>

<p>Margrit: &ldquo;Four? Why, that&rsquo;s more than yesterday. I am so glad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;I just hope it keeps increasing, because winter is coming soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t worry son.&rdquo; said Terry. &ldquo;We survive every winter. We always manage to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The market place in Almerak was always flooded with people. All kinds of products could be found, including illegal ones. Basically, this was the best place for business.</p>

<p>Two mean looking soldiers stopped by a fruit stand. &ldquo;Have you seen this person?&rdquo; one of them asked the owner, showing him a picture of the princess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; replied the nervous man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you see her, tell us. There will be a reward.&rdquo; They continued walking.</p>

<p>Princess Faith was hiding behind the wall of a building, spying on the soldiers. She sighed in relief when they left. She wore a ragged cloth over her clothes and a hood over her head to hide her identity.</p>

<p>Tyson walked through the crowds, holding the bag of money in front of him. (What should I buy?) he asked himself. He had only two silver pieces, and better not waste it. He was hungry and wanted to make a decision quickly. Thinking so much, he did not realize he walked in the wrong direction, into the alleys.</p>

<p>Faith gasped and screamed. &ldquo;Who are you?!&rdquo; She stepped back as six men approached her.</p>

<p>Koga: &ldquo;Come with us, princess. We will not hurt you if you do not resist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must have the wrong person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, my dear. You <em>are</em> the princess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;G-Get away from me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Koga was the leader of the Koga clan (named after himself, of course), a deadly organization of ninjas, whom provided services for those who provided them money. They were willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done.</p>

<p>Koga was accompanied by five of his ninjas, each with a different colored suit and mask: red, blue, yellow, white, and black. They dared not speak without their leader&rsquo;s permission.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay back! Get away!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson heard her screams for help and ran towards them. &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he yelled.</p>

<p>Koga stared at him with cold eyes. &ldquo;Stay away boy. This is none of your concern.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help me, please!&rdquo; Faith pleaded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is now.&rdquo; Tyson answered.</p>

<p>Koga: &ldquo;Get rid of this pest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The blue ninja approached Tyson offensively. He threw a punch, Tyson ducked, and punched him in the stomach. Pow!</p>

<p>Koga: &ldquo;What kind of skills are those? Get him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Four ninjas surrounded Tyson. Koga grabbed Faith&rsquo;s arm and she struggled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll save you!&rdquo; said Tyson.</p>

<p>The ninjas attacked. Red and Yellow kicked him. He blocked their kicks and then White punched. Tyson pushed their feet away, then blocked his punch. Wham. Tyson punched, White dodged, then Black punched from behind. Tyson jumped, landed behind Black, then whacked his back. In no time at all he defeated all the ninjas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is not possible.&rdquo; said Koga in shock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let her go.&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p>Faith struggled and Koga was losing his grip on her. Tyson seized the chance and charged and kicked Koga in the stomach. Then he gave him a punch in the face &ndash; pow!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your lucky this time, punk.&rdquo; Koga and his ninjas fled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Phew. That was close. You okay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mmm.&rdquo; Faith said, nodding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You gotta be careful in places like these, ya know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; she said shyly.</p>

<p>Tyson noticed she was beautiful. &ldquo;No problem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I...I have to go.&rdquo; She turned around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait. What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And my name is Tyson Spade!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She left.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faith, you fool.&rdquo; said Lisa as she walked in the darkness. &ldquo;If your going, then so am I. I will find you and Tyson alone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The beautiful hills that were once near Tyson&rsquo;s house were no longer there. It was just a barren land. Countless destruction has occurred since the merger, but luckily some places remained unharmed. Such was the Meridian Forest (most of it anyway), the place were Tyson and Faith trained seven years ago, and this was the forest that connected Tyson&rsquo;s house to Network City. Because of its size, some of it was undamaged. The Mercadian Forest, the one five miles from the Imperial Palace and near Network City, would be the place that Nebula and Blaire start their duel&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faith? Faith?&rdquo; shouted Nebula. &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; He searched all night, but found zilch. &ldquo;Damn it, where are you?&rdquo; He wished she hadn&rsquo;t done something so rash. First his brother, then Faith. He hoped he wasn&rsquo;t next.</p>

<p>A figure was watching him from above, jumping from branch to branch stealthily. Nebula knew he was being followed, and his eyeballs moved to the corner of his eye, and he was sure of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alright, I know you&rsquo;re out there. Show yourself if you&rsquo;re a man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blaire landed behind Nebula. &ldquo;Very impressive indeed. You sensed me even when I tried my best not to get discovered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sense anything around me, especially if it&rsquo;s an enemy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember you. You&rsquo;re one of Drago&rsquo;s students.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smiled. &ldquo;Yes. Last time we had some interruptions, correct? Why not we finish this here and now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I agree.&rdquo; He got into fighting position. &ldquo;One of us is going to die here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right, and that one is going to be you. And I will show you why!&rdquo; He took out a torch and lighted it up. He used the Hurricane Hell Storm attack. Blaire blew into the torch and a huge beam of fire charged at Nebula.</p>

<p>He jumped out of the way, rolling on the ground, and the fire missed him, torching the ground and the trees. Boom! A trail of fire and destruction was left behind. Nebula, on his knees and hands, stood up, shocked at Blaire&rsquo;s power.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I missed!&rdquo; he said as if he expected it. &ldquo;Did you like that? Here&rsquo;s another one!&rdquo; He attacked again, and Nebula dodged desperately. Blaire kept on firing and all Nebula could do was dodge. Vroom! His arm got burned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is matter, warrior? Too hot for you to handle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bastard!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blaire used that move again and Nebula dodged for his life. Vroom! Fire was everywhere. The ground was burnt to ashes.</p>

<p>Blaire used the Hurricane Hell Storm again. Nebula jumped onto a tree branch, and the fire charged at him diagonally at super high speed. Nebula jumped above it, then dived down, with his fist ready. Blaire let out a scream of shock as he watched Nebula dive at him. &ldquo;Take this bastard!&rdquo; Nebula yelled. Pow! His fist slammed into Blaire&rsquo;s face. He fell on his back and Nebula fell face flat.</p>

<p>Both warriors stood up. &ldquo;You pay for that!&rdquo; Blaire shouted angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring it on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They hit each other dozens of times, and then jumped into the air and kept hitting. Blaire smacked Nebula&rsquo;s face with his elbow and he fell on the ground. Nebula drew his sword, then Blaire drew his. Two seconds later, they charged and slashed.</p>

<p>Blaire powered up his sword, embedding it in flames. Nebula watched with wide open eyes as he did this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Feel the heat of my flame sword!&rdquo; he said. The sword was now literally on fire, but Blaire&rsquo;s hands were not burned, but he seemed to have a resistance to fire. He charged wildly and slashed. Nebula blocked his attack, but felt Blaire&rsquo;s strength in that hit. Whack! His sword shuddered and his feet almost lost balance. &ldquo;Die!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In your dreams!&rdquo; Nebula slashed.</p>

<p>Blaire blocked it. Sparks produced from the collision and went on the ground. They slashed again, and then jumped back. Blaire used his left hand and shot a laser of fire at Nebula&rsquo;s sword. It heated up instantly and became red and burning. Nebula dropped it and blew his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahh!&rdquo; He blew his hands and looked at the burn. Then he looked at his sword. It was burning red, and impossible to touch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you are unarmed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula: (I can&rsquo;t use my sword, damn it. I have to wait until it cools down. What should I do now?)</p>

<p>Blaire charged and slashed. Nebula dodged his blade. For a while, Blaire clearly had the advantage, and he did not hesitate to use it. Nebula dodged and thought that attacking was too risky. Slash! Whoosh! The fire from Blaire&rsquo;s sword cut Nebula&rsquo;s left arm!</p>

<p>He was bleeding from the cut, but luckily it was a minor one. He touched his wound and felt blood coming out. Blaire smiled and advanced as Nebula stepped back. What now, he thought. He looked to the right. Only one chance, the river. It&rsquo;s worth a shot.</p>

<p>Blaire charged and slashed. Nebula jumped through the trees and Blaire jumped after him. Blaire slashed and Nebula dodged to the side. His enemy was open to attack for only a split second, and Nebula punched him in the face Pow! As he fell, Nebula kicked him in the chin. Wham! Blaire dropped his sword, then fell splat on the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why you!&rdquo; He ran to get the sword, Nebula blasted the ground, and the sword was blown away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha. Now you have no weapon either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heh. Then I will have to use other means to kill you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your fists won&rsquo;t kill me easily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blaire powered up and Nebula could feel the heat produced from his body. &ldquo;I&#8230;I will incinerate you!&rdquo; His fists clenched tightly, and fire showed on his palms. His whole body was covered with red hot fire and the ground he stood on was burning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&#8230;why you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I was born I discovered that I had resistance to fire. And now, thanks to Master Drago, I am able to use fire as a weapon of destruction!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula was sweating, not because it&rsquo;s hot, but he was getting worried. &ldquo;Then make my day!&rdquo; He powered up.</p>

<p>Blaire shot a fireball at him, Nebula jumped away. Blaire then shot two, Nebula dodged sideways.</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. It&rsquo;s time to play fire with fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blaire gathered energy and threw a large fireball at his opponent. Nebula countered with the Energy Bomb. Boom!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bastard!&rdquo; Nebula fired an energy ball, Blaire dodged. Nebula did a flying kick and Blaire jumped out of the way. Then they ran parallel to each other, running through the trees. (If I could just get him to the lake&#8230;) Nebula thought as he ran. Then he jumped, Blaire followed. Their movements were so fast that their bodies looked like blurred lines moving in the wind.</p>

<p>Blaire hit Nebula in mid air, and Nebula pushed his enemy and himself into the lake. Splash! The were submerged, and began to sink slowly, until they reached the ground level. They punched each other and breathed bubbles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said Blaire. &ldquo;You think by luring me here to the water I will not be able to use my fire powers? You simple-minded fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p> Nebula grunted. He punched and Blaire dodged. He countered with a punch to Nebula&rsquo;s stomach and he moaned when he got hit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take this!&rdquo; Blaire released energy from his palms and shot out a wave of water and hit Nebula, knocking him against the rocks. &ldquo;You did not expect I could do that, did you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Die!&rdquo; Nebula charged.</p>

<p>Blaire fired another wave and Nebula was caught in the middle. He was spinning and the wave went into the rocks, dragging him into it. Boom! Luckily, he wasn&rsquo;t gone yet. He swam up and wanted to get air. Blaire grabbed his foot and Nebula used his other foot and stepped on Blaire&rsquo;s face. Stomp! He screamed and sank. Nebula flew up and breathed hard. Blaire came up and he was angry.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tyson and Faith were still stuck in Drago&rsquo;s fabricated dream world. In there, they were but helpless puppets, with no memories of their true selves, but continue to live on in the dream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your majesty, we have found your daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas: &ldquo;Yes, I have received your message. Is she here yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She just entered the main gate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith entered the throne room, accompanied by two soldiers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear daughter!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; she yelled, and ran and they hugged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. As long as you are safe I am happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They let go. &ldquo;I am so glad to be back home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did anybody try to hurt you, while you were in the peasant world?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes...these men tried to take my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas was shocked. He instantly became angry and overprotective. &ldquo;Who? Who dares?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They knew I am the princess. A man, he says he&rsquo;s in some clan, and there were five ninjas with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you say ninjas...?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, five of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly, Midas became dumbfounded. Everything around him disappeared and he was surrounded by darkness. &ldquo;No...It cannot be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What...what is it, father?&rdquo;<br>  Darian entered. &ldquo;I am glad to see your return, princess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prince Darian?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, your majesty? You do not look well. Are you not happy to see your daughter home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas: &ldquo;Daughter, do you know if the man who attacked you was named Koga?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know. He never told me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must have been him. There can be no other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;Do you know something that I do not? Father, please tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas paused. He thought it was time to reveal his dark past. &ldquo;It all started twenty years ago...at that time you were just born, daughter. During that time, the king of Almerak was about to die. He had two trusted companions, me and some one else. The other one was Vega. We have both known the king for a large number of years, and one of us would be the new king, his successor to the throne of Almerak. He chose me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that is how you became king, your majesty. But what about the other person?&rdquo; asked Darian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was outraged at the king&rsquo;s decision. He could not understand why the king chose me over him. In fact, even I do not know, but I respect his decision fully. Vega&rsquo;s hatred, over time, grew and grew. He did everything he could to take the throne from me, even if it meant taking my life. He hired another of my enemies, Koga, and his clan of ninja warriors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you understand all. He wants to use my own daughter to threaten me to give up the throne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will he try again?&rdquo; asked Faith in fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am afraid.&rdquo; He sat down and moaned in grief. &ldquo;Not even the best guards can protect us from his trained warriors. They are too skilled, in fact, their deadly fighting techniques are known throughout the seven kingdoms. What do I do? What do I do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your majesty, perhaps we should hire more guards to protect the princess. We can make every inch of this castle safe.&rdquo; said Darian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It makes no difference how many men. It is no use!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Advisor: &ldquo;Your majesty, I have no doubt that the Koga clan is strong. But I am certain there are other clans equally strong. Maybe even located in Almerak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas: &ldquo;But we know of no warriors who are exceptionally good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may never know. Maybe amongst the peasants is a martial arts master. Anybody can be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Darian: &ldquo;Use me and my men, your majesty! Zaibach is the birthplace of the best warriors! I swear I will protect the princess with my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas: &ldquo;I am grateful for your concern, but I suggest it not, for the sake of your life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Darian became disappointed. That was a good chance to prove himself worthy.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Faith thought of Tyson. &ldquo;Ahh,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I know some one who can help us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who do you speak of?&rdquo; her father asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those ninjas attacked me and he showed up out of nowhere and saved me. He defeated all five ninjas single-handed. He is an amazing warrior!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we must find this warrior.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Darian: &ldquo;I do not think such a warrior exists.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes he does! I saw it with my own eyes. His name is Tyson Spade!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Find the man named Tyson Spade. Offer any amount of money. Bring him to the castle immediately.&rdquo; Midas addressed the advisor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right away, your majesty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soldiers came to the field while Terry and his son were working. They approached, and the father and son wondered what they want.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this the Spade residence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Terry: &ldquo;Yes. What is the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is Tyson Spade?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo; Tyson said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the reason?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want with my son?&rdquo; asked Terry.</p>

<p>Margrit came out from the house. &ldquo;What is going? What are these soldiers doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soldier: &ldquo;Tyson Spade, come with us to the Imperial Palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;I am sure it is a misunderstanding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Terry: &ldquo;Wait a minute, my son didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong. Can&rsquo;t we talk this over?&rdquo; He was holding a fist. He didn&rsquo;t know how long his temper can save him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with him?&rdquo; Margrit asked fearfully. It was a shock that this happened so suddenly. She knew in her heart her son would never break the law. This was all a mistake.</p>

<p>Soldier: &ldquo;Listen, just do as we say to avoid any complications.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;Okay, I will go with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Son!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. I am sure it is some sort of misunderstanding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The soldiers took him away, with his parents watching in agony.</p>

<p>As Tyson and the soldiers around him walked, he began to think of the reason this happened. Maybe it had something to do with the ninjas and the girl he encountered yesterday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, what is all this about?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;What crime have I committed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soldier: &ldquo;You got it all wrong. It is not a crime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wha? You&rsquo;re not gonna arrest me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Not at all. We will explain everything once we get to the palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two warriors floated over the water, remained calm and stared at each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no use fighting on. You know you can&rsquo;t win.&rdquo; said Blaire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never know unless you tried.&rdquo; Nebula replied positively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are nothing without your brother, Nebula Spade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you say?!&rdquo; Now he was pissed. He charged with a ferocious punch. Blaire felt the anger in the punch, it was very powerful. Nebula kept attacking, and they were back on land. Blaire was slammed into the trees, and every tree that he hit was shattered into pieces. &ldquo;Time to end this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blaire got up. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gathered energy for his ultimate attack. &ldquo;Nebula Blast!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What strong power! Aaagh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula held a large, spherical blue ball in front of him, and he lifted it up above him, then threw it. It shot from his palms like a rocket. Bam! It pushed all the winds out of its path, and the ground fell apart as the ball touched it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Blaire used the spiritual fire from his body as a shield and blocked it. It exploded when the Nebula Blast touched him. BOOM! He survived, but his clothes were messed up and he was injured. &ldquo;Blast you, earth warrior!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You survived?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bet that was your last reserve. If so, I am afraid it&rsquo;s the end for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dream on. I still have enough energy to do two more of those.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not allow you the time for it! I am going to kill you now!&rdquo; He shot a fiery beam at his enemy.</p>

<p>Nebula jumped out of the way, the beam hit the ground and exploded like a bomb.</p>

<p> Blaire shot beams of fire and Nebula dodged in the air. Zoom! Zoom! They almost hit him. He landed on the ground, and then shot a bunch of energy balls at his target. Blaire used the spirit fire and formed a bubble shield. The energy balls hit him and bounced off in several directions. It wasn&rsquo;t working, but Nebula kept shooting, hoping it will wear him down. Blaire screamed and powered up, and Nebula winced from the wind and felt his energy level.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t afford to lose.&rdquo; Nebula said to himself, gathering energy.</p>

<p>Blaire picked up his sword and leaped into the air. &ldquo;Ha ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nebula fired the Nebula Blast up, Blaire raised his sword and chopped the gigantic ball of energy in half. Chop! The energy shattered into energy sparkles. &ldquo;No, it can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha ha! I guess that means you have one more of those left.&rdquo; Blaire landed. &ldquo;I still have plenty of fire power to give you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible&#8230;he avoided becoming seriously wounded twice, from my best move. I can&rsquo;t afford to use it again&#8230;&rdquo; he said to himself. By now, he was tired as if he had worked all week long.</p>

<p>Blaire was tired too, but tried to hide it as much as possible. Suddenly, he jumped and slashed. Nebula ran, dodging the blade. He recognized this spot, it was when they fought earlier. That means his sword must be close by, he thought. Bingo, it was just ahead. By now, he assumed, it was cooled and safe to use. He grabbed it while running, Blaire kept chasing. Suddenly, Nebula turned around, and Blaire stopped. They slashed</p>

<p>at each other violently, not holding anything back. The warriors gave everything they had in those hits.</p>

<p>Nebula and Blaire stared, then charged. They hit with the swords in a flash, and ran past each other. They stopped, not moving from their position, and wondered who was hit. Blaire suddenly felt pain on his stomach. Blood dripped on the dirt.</p>

<p>Nebula: &ldquo;You lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It c-can&rsquo;t be&#8230;&rdquo; He collapsed.</p>

<p>Nebula smiled, but then the pain got the best of him. He knew he was hit as well, and he collapsed.</p>

<p>Ace and Marianna were on the balcony, standing between the columns. &ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t returned yet. Not one of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lisa went with them too?&rdquo; Marianna asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t supposed to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now there&rsquo;s only four of us left in the castle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they heard footsteps coming from the stairs.</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;Junior?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The kid came down, rubbing his eyes. &ldquo;Where is everybody?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;Uhh, what do you mean? Go back to sleep, kid. You need some rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How come tonight the place is so quiet? Everybody is gone! Including my father and mother. Where are they? Where did the go? Did they go to fight Vega?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They did not answer.</p>

<p>Junior, judging from their silence, knew he was right. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m right, aren&rsquo;t I? My mother is gone too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;It is nothing to worry about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it true, Marianna? You never lied to me! Tell me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Marianna answered painfully. &ldquo;They all left. But don&rsquo;t worry, I am sure your mother is fine. The others are looking for her. You know that they are the best warriors you can find.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I have no doubt in their ability. You must believe too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we look for them too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;No, like we said, it&rsquo;s too dangerous. Go back to your room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; he said, then left.</p>

<p>Tyson was quite surprised to learn that he was not arrested. He knew the reason for the soldiers picking him up had something to do with the event yesterday, but he didn&rsquo;t know exactly what&rsquo;s going on. He said a lot of &ldquo;wows&rdquo; when he reached the front gate. The castle was huge. One of the soldiers knocked at the large door, and the person behind the door asked some question, the soldier answered, then the door began to come down. They took him inside, and to his surprise, he was taken directly to see the king.</p>

<p>The room was filled with objects that Tyson could never afford in a lifetime. It was so big, he could&rsquo;ve sworn it was three times the size of his house. In the middle was a red carpet. It went all the way from the doors to the stairs, and on top of the stairs was the king&rsquo;s chair.</p>

<p>He bowed down, like every one else. Midas dismissed the soldiers, and only Tyson, the king, the princess, several advisors, royal guards, and Prince Darian was left.</p>

<p>Midas: &ldquo;Welcome, Tyson Spade. Your extraordinary skills have been recognized.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson was in shock. He couldn&rsquo;t believe he was actually inside the Imperial Palace, inside the throne room, and in front of him was the king of all Almerak. As a peasant, one was expected never to even set foot near the castle. And now, for nothing at all, he had the privilege of coming in here. &ldquo;Uhhh, thank you, y-your majesty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, this is the one brave warrior I have been talking about.&rdquo; Faith said, walking down the steps.</p>

<p>Tyson looked at her and recognized her. (That&rsquo;s the girl from yesterday! What the heck is going on?)</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the man who defeated Koga&rsquo;s ninjas. All by himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(She&rsquo;s the princess? Oh my God! This can&rsquo;t be happening.) His shock made him not realize that this was a good thing. Maybe he&rsquo;s going to be rewarded for his heroic efforts!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is the one.&rdquo; said the princess. &ldquo;Tell them, Tyson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uhhh&#8230;yeah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas: &ldquo;You saved my daughter&rsquo;s life. Warrior, I will make sure you are rewarded for your deed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson couldn&rsquo;t think of anything else to say except: &ldquo;Thank you, your majesty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does five thousand gold pieces sound good?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;F-five th-thousand?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You deserve every bit of it.&rdquo; Faith said, smiling.</p>

<p>Darian: &ldquo;Now wait a minute. How do we know if he is the one? We cannot just trust him without any proof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well then.&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;Would you care to demonstrate your skills, young man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;d be glad to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Darian: (Now&rsquo;s my chance to prove myself worthy.) &ldquo;I shall be your opponent, Spade.&rdquo; He walked towards the center.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; Tyson said, and got ready to fight.</p>

<p>Darian: (I will not lose! I will show them all the superiority of Zaibach&rsquo;s warriors!)</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;Ready when you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everybody waited in suspense, especially Midas and Faith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to give it all I got.&rdquo; Tyson said. &ldquo;Ready when you are, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prince attacked with a powerful punch. Tyson dodged it. The king gasped. Everybody had a reaction to the first move. Darian kicked and Tyson blocked it. He kicked again, Tyson ducked, then went to another spot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay, here I come.&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Darian could not stand this guy&rsquo;s politeness. He swore he will win. He continued to attack ruthlessly. Tyson countered with a punch to the stomach, and Darian felt great pain. Then he punched the prince&rsquo;s face and did a roundhouse kick to his face. Pow! Wham! The prince fell on his back.</p>

<p>Everybody clapped, including the king. Tyson offered his hand to the fallen Darian. The prince was mad as hell, and anger was written all over his face. He took Tyson&rsquo;s hand, controlling his temper as much as possible.</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;It was a good match, prince Darian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again, with that politeness. Darian hated him even more, being so polite after he beat him. He knew that deep down, Tyson mocked him. &ldquo;Yes. Your skills are not bad, boy. We shall fight again, someday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson bowed down. &ldquo;Your majesty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;See father? I told you he could do it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas: &ldquo;I have a job for you, young one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Become my daughter&rsquo;s personal bodyguard. I will make sure you are well-paid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A...bodyguard?&rdquo; He was surprised. So this was what&rsquo;s this all about.</p>

<p>Advisor: &ldquo;Think carefully before making your decision. A chance like this does not come by often.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(An offer from the king himself...to protect the princess...to get so much money...how can I possibly refuse?) &ldquo;I accept the offer, your majesty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas: &ldquo;Just as I thought, young lad. You shall receive ten pieces of gold each day, in addition to the five thousand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my parents-&ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not worry. They will be paid as well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I meant that, I gotta tell them. They are worried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith smiled and said: &ldquo;Oh do not worry about such small things. We will send a messenger for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uh, thank you, princess. So, then, um, when do we start?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right now.&rdquo; said the advisor.</p>

<p>Darian stood behind the column, humiliated. (How dare he defeat me, in front of everybody &ndash; the king, Princess Faith! I swear, boy, this is not over.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at this...&rdquo; said Margrit, emptying a bag of coins. The coins fell on the table and rolled, then stopped.</p>

<p>Terry: &ldquo;Lord, it&rsquo;s ten gold pieces! I&rsquo;ve never seen so much money in one spot in my life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our son has gotten a job! A real job!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What...do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just go a message. He is a bodyguard...hired by the king himself!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A royal bodyguard? Wow, and we were so worried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so proud of him. He&rsquo;s finally making good of himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my son alright. I think we don&rsquo;t have anything to worry about anymore.?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prince Acelot and Marianna had just started their relationship, but unfortunately, due to the circumstances, and constant worrying about their lives and about the future, they did not have the chance to get more intimate with each other. It was strange, Ace thought, that he was always fond of her, and didn&rsquo;t know she felt the same. Only his sister, and Marianna&rsquo;s best friend, was able to bring them together.</p>

<p>Only one thing came in between them; it was their way of dealing with kids. This was shown in their treatment of Junior. Ace wants to hide everything from the kid, just like his sister, but Marianna, on the other hand, wants to let Junior know everything, even if he&rsquo;s too young to understand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you seen Junior?&rdquo; Marianne asked Ace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he in the bedroom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just checked there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where could he be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; he suddenly yelled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What if he ran away like his mother did?&rdquo;<br>  &ldquo;No, he wouldn&rsquo;t&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have to find him.&rdquo;<br>  &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t let him be in danger!&rdquo; They ran down the hallway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the hurry?&rdquo; King Midas asked.</p>

<p>Marianne: &ldquo;Junior has ran away!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king had a shocked face. <br>  Ace: &ldquo;We will find him, father. Will you be alright alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Just go, please find my grandson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Junior!&rdquo; shouted Marianna as she ran through the trees. It was already past midnight and the sky was pitch black. She was running breathless, but didn&rsquo;t stop a second to rest.</p>

<p>Junior ran and became breathless. (Mother, father, I will come and find you! Wait for me!) As a kid, his parents meant everything to him, even his father. He did not care to think about the consequences, all he wanted was to bring them back.</p>

<p>(Junior, I won&rsquo;t let anything happen to you!) Marianna thought running and breathing hard.</p>

<p>Will she find Junior in time and bring him home safe?</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="PF_12_A">12: Interdimensional Showdown Round 2: Straight Shooter </span></p></center>


<p>&ldquo;Junior! Where are you?!&rdquo; shouted Ace. &ldquo;Junior?&rdquo; He ran straight down the forest road and found not even a clue. He decided not to wander too far or he might get lost. He just could not believe al this has happened. First Tyson, then Faith, then their son. It must be a family trait.</p>

<p>Marianna was also searching in a different part of the forest. She and Ace agreed to meet back at the castle in two hours, whether Junior was found or not. She knew that she just had to find him. A poor kid shouldn&rsquo;t be dragged into this war.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow...&rdquo; said Tyson, looking at a mirror. He was dressed like a knight now, with one shoulder pad, a leather strap, a chest plate, metal boots, and even a sword. He just couldn&rsquo;t believe he was actually a bodyguard &ndash; not just any bodyguard, the princess&rsquo;s personal bodyguard! He never before thought of himself this way before, and thought he looked &lsquo;cool.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Beside him were servants who helped him dress up. &ldquo;Hmmm, it fits you perfectly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really? Gosh, thanks for the wonderful job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No need to thank us, sir. These are our duties.&rdquo; They bowed down as Faith entered. Tyson bowed. The servants left.</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;So...correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, you&rsquo;re the girl I met on the street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t tell me you were the princess!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not get a chance. Not even to thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this a way of thanking me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you wish.&rdquo; she said, smiling. &ldquo;The gold pieces you received &ndash; consider them as a reward. It is the least I can do for you...for saving my life.&rdquo; She blushed and looked at the floor, trying to hide her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, umm...I...I hate it when people bully others. I was just helping, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Tyson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, no problem, princess. I swear on my sword I will do everything it takes to protect you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know I will be safe with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way-&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who were those guys who attacked you? What did they want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me explain everything while I give you a tour of the place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, okay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we start?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ready when you are, princess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Junior ran and ran for hours, and even though he knew he was not even close to finding his parents, he kept on running. Tiredness was not a factor anymore. He was sweating from running, and cold at the same time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mommy&#8230;where are you?&rdquo; he said, sobbing. He felt so lonely and depressed. He even wanted his father back, heck, it was better than nobody.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, little boy? Why are you crying?&rdquo; said the voice of a woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; He suddenly forgot about his sadness. &ldquo;Who said that? Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you so depressed? Is something troubling you?&rdquo; said Maxima.</p>

<p>Junior went towards the source of the sound, and saw a bright light ahead of him. In the light was a person standing, it was too bright for him to make out the person&rsquo;s features. He went towards it, leaving the woods, and he was in a rock-type valley. &ldquo;W-Who are you, lady?&rdquo; He noticed she was very pretty, and seemed like some one who could help. She had long, blue hair, tied to a pony tail, and deep, blue eyes. She wore a green shirt, a shoulder pad, blue tights, and boots. Stuck to her back were weapons.</p>

<p>Maxima approached the startled boy. &ldquo;What is your name, boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;J-Junior.&rdquo; he answered timidly.</p>

<p>(As I thought, he is the son of Princess Faith. Today is my lucky day.) &ldquo;What is a boy like you doing in a deserted place like this at this hour? Are you lost?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ummm, kinda.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor little child, lost in the middle of nowhere with no place to go to. Come with me child. I will take you to a safe place.&rdquo; She stuck out her hand.</p>

<p>Junior did not take it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is matter?&rdquo; she asked nicely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mom told me not to trust strangers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really? But you can trust me. I&rsquo;m a friend. Don&rsquo;t worry, I am not a bad person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ummm&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on Junior, I am here to help you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay&#8230;&rdquo; He put his hand on her hand.</p>

<p>Maxima smiled. Her plan had worked.</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;Not so fast!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Junior: &ldquo;Marianne! It&rsquo;s you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen kid, she&rsquo;s not one of us. She is a bad guy! Don&rsquo;t trust her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Junior quickly ran to his friend.</p>

<p>Maxima: &ldquo;Why you, how dare you interfere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not taking this kid with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Earth warrior, today is the day you die!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Junior, get out of here now.&rdquo; Marianna said, taking out a sword.</p>

<p>Jr. hesitated, then ran away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody escapes!&rdquo; Maxima extended her arm and shot an energy ray at Junior.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Marianna shouted.</p>

<p>Boom! It hit the rocks and knocked Jr. unconscious. Marianna charged and slashed, Maxima dodged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You okay, kid?!&rdquo; she asked. No response. &ldquo;Arrrrgh, I will not forgive for this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maxima took out two daggers, they were sharp and pointy. &ldquo;Go ahead, try and defeat me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will!&rdquo; She jumped and drew back the sword, making sure the hit will be extra strong. Clang! It was blocked by Maxima&rsquo;s daggers, held in an X position. Now her sword was stuck in between them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that the best you can do? Pity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Die you witch!&rdquo; She drew back the sword and slashed. Maxima blocked. Cling! They jumped away from each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marianna, an expert archer. You started out as a thief, but then joined the earth warriors to defeat the Dark Society.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you telling me this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maxima laughed. &ldquo;I know everything there is to know about you. I know every aspect of your life as if it was my own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think I care?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marianna, I basically know all your moves. How do you expect to defeat me? I am named after the Goddess of wisdom. I believe that in order to defeat some one you must know everything about that person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(She&rsquo;s right. She knows my fighting style and that means she has every advantage here. There&rsquo;s gotta something that she doesn&rsquo;t know.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to enjoy killing you. Prepare to die, Marianna!&rdquo; She jumped into the air and did some spins, and dived down, with her daggers pointing down.</p>

<p>Marianna ran and dodged the attack. When Maxima hit the ground, Marianna stopped and charged towards her enemy. Maxima stood still and confidently. She threw her daggers and they were spinning like boomerangs. Marianna panicked and one dagger knocked her sword away. The other flew at her and she ducked. The daggers flew in the air, and then went on a roundtrip back to Maxima&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<p>Marianna took out a bow and loaded an arrow into it. Maxima ran and she ran after her. Fling! She shot the arrow, Maxima jumped and the arrow hit a rock!</p>

<p>&ldquo;You missed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna quickly loaded another arrow and shot it while running. Maxima dodged it. She kept on shooting. Maxima hit it with her daggers. She jumped onto the rocks, reaching the top of the mountain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha! Marianna, you cannot hit me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn, she moves fast.&rdquo; She loaded an arrow and aimed at the person above. Maxima jumped down. Marianna shot, but missed. She quickly loaded another arrow and shot it, and missed again. Maxima landed on the ground, then ran behind a boulder in a flash. There was no trace of her now.</p>

<p>Marianna hid behind a boulder. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t lose. I can&rsquo;t afford to&#8230;she&rsquo;s going to take Junior. I will not let that happen.&rdquo; She whispered to herself.</p>

<p>Lisa found her way to Skull Mountain somehow, and easily made it in, since they were no guards. She carefully went down the hallway, making sure each step was soundless, walking like a ninja. She found a large room, with three people, two of which were lying down on some sort of bed. She hid behind the wall, then peeped, not daring to stick her head out.</p>

<p>(I found them at last.) she thought. Those two lying down were no other than Tyson and Faith. The other man, no doubt, was Drago.</p>

<p>All Lisa had was her trusty handgun and nothing else. She thought that&rsquo;d be enough to take him out. Her plan was to shoot him when his back faces her. Yep, simple and easy.</p>

<p>Drago, while watching the crystal ball, sensed something was not right. (There is an intruder here.)</p>

<p>Suddenly, Lisa stepped out, revealing herself. She pulled the trigger and yelled &ldquo;Die!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drago opened his palm and the bullet stopped in mid air, almost touching his hand. It dropped on the floor with a clink.</p>

<p>Lisa: &ldquo;What have you done to them? Set them free now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How dare you interrupt me. I will deal with you later, human.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said now!&rdquo; She fired again.</p>

<p>Drago jumped up and landed. He put his fingers together, and a red bubble trapped Lisa inside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the hell is this?!&rdquo; Lisa, inside the bubble, floated in the air, and stayed that way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nuisance. Once I am done with them, I will kill you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Noooo! Let me out! Let me out!&rdquo; She banged her fist on the bubble wall, but it had no effect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no use resisting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Koga bowed down before the man sitting on the chair. &ldquo;Vega, I have returned.&rdquo; His five ninjas were beside him, kneeling.<br>  &ldquo;You have returned, I see, empty-handed. Where is the princess?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We...ran into a minor inconvenience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not bring the princess. I do not tolerate failure, understand?! Bring her to me by tomorrow or I will have your head!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, back at the Imperial Palace, the king, princess, prince, and bodyguard were having a feast, celebrating Tyson&rsquo;s new job.</p>

<p>To Tyson, a regular peasant, it was the biggest meal he had in his life. Maybe good things <em>do </em>happen to good people, he thought as he was eating. He ate hungrily, but was well aware of his manners, and tried not to eat like a pig.</p>

<p>Darian: &ldquo;My my, we sure are hungry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah...I don&rsquo;t recognize half the food here, but it&rsquo;s delicious!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;Oh my. Eat slower and careful not to choke.&rdquo; She was drinking wine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eat well, young one.&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;You need the energy when protecting my daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, your majesty. I will put my life on the line at any given moment. The princess&rsquo;s life is more important that mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas: &ldquo;I am glad you are ready. Very well, tonight, let us celebrate this joyous occasion!&rdquo; He held his cup in the air, and everybody followed.</p>

<p>Tyson wondered how his parents were doing. He just wished he could&rsquo;ve said one last goodbye before he left. Oh well, at least they know he&rsquo;s doing just fine. He always wanted to make his parents proud of him, and what better way to do it than actually being inside this castle! What a chance of a lifetime...</p>

<p>Outside, Koga and his ninjas were planning the ambush. Their plan was this: make the guards fall asleep, find the princess and capture her, then escape. It was easier said than done, without the knowledge that Tyson was inside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you, Marianna? Come out, come out.&rdquo; taunted Maxima, searching for her foe. She looked all around her, and tried to listen for any sounds. The night was quiet. She jumped onto another rock.</p>

<p>Luckily, she did not find Marianna, who was hiding beside the rock Maxima was just on. She could feel her heart thumping. She stood up and looked, but did not see Maxima. Where did she go? Her bow and arrow were ready, all she needed was a target.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Maxima appeared in the air. Marianna shot the arrow, but Maxima evaded. She landed, then charged, and slashed with the daggers. Marianna blocked them with her bow, and they struggled. They pushed each other away with their weapons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What good is an archer if she cannot hit her target?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me tell you this, Maxima, I will never let Vega have this dimension!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How will you stop him, then, if you cannot even defeat me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Says who?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Says me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They charged and attacked.</p>

<p>Will Tyson and Faith ever wake up from the dream world, or will they be stuck there forever? Lisa tried to save them, but failed. Marianna and Maxima were still dueling in a life and death battle, so what will happen to the heroes?</p>

<p>In the castle, Princess Faith was in her bedroom, trying to sleep. Tyson stood just outside the door, on guard. Midas and Darian were still drinking happily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, have another.&rdquo; said the king drunkenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I could not p-possibly swallow another drop, your m-majesty...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on now, you do not want it toooo be w-wasted, n-now, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alrighty, then.&rdquo; Darian drank directly from the bottle.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a weird smoke came into the room. The guards fell asleep.</p>

<p>Midas: &ldquo;What iz going on here?&rdquo; He fell asleep, along with Darian. The castle was quiet.</p>

<p>Tyson was asleep and snoring, but something woke him up. &ldquo;Huh? What&rsquo;s that smell?&rdquo; There was something wrong, all right. He went to the dining room, and found Midas, Darian and the guards asleep. &ldquo;This is not right. What is going on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith was still asleep in her room.</p>

<p>Koga: &ldquo;Find the princess. Kill anybody who is still awake.&rdquo; The ninjas went off in different directions.</p>

<p>Tyson quickly went back to the princess&rsquo;s room. (That gas they used was a special type of sleeping gas. They can&rsquo;t be detected, they are colorless and invisible. One of the deadliest ones out there.) Knock knock. &ldquo;Princess Faith!&rdquo; He banged on the door. &ldquo;This is an emergency!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith came out sleepily. &ldquo;What is the matter, Tyson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are in danger. We better hide, right now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; This was too sudden for her. She didn&rsquo;t expect her father&rsquo;s enemies to strike so soon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must go now, princess.&rdquo; He took her hand and they ran down the hallway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The dungeon is that way.&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the white ninja appeared in front of them. They turned around and Red was there. This was a bad situation. An enemy on both sides, and he has to protect the princess. Tyson screamed and attacked. The two ninjas hit him with everything they&rsquo;ve got, as Faith stepped to the side and watched.</p>

<p>Pow! Wham! Tyson slammed White into Red, and one side of the hall was clear. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; he said, grabbing Faith and running fast.</p>

<p>Black: &ldquo;There they are!&rdquo; He threw a knife at them, but missed. Tyson and Faith reached a window. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s jump.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here? Are you nuts?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have to, or we&rsquo;ll die!&rdquo; Tyson jumped down, and landed on his feet. &ldquo;Jump. I&rsquo;ll catch you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: &ldquo;No way!&rdquo; She looked behind and saw three ninjas coming for her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry.&rdquo; Tyson rushed.</p>

<p>Faith, realizing she had no choice, took a deep breath and jumped, and landed safely in Tyson&rsquo;s arms. He set her down. There was no time to celebrate. He took her by the hand and ran into the trees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After them.&rdquo; Koga said to his ninjas. &ldquo;They must not escape the forest, understood?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ninjas vanished.</p>

<p>Tyson and the princess ran for their lives. They looked back, seeing the ninjas chase them from a distance. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; Tyson yelled.</p>

<p>Faith breathed hard and kept running.</p>

<p>After about half an hour of running, Faith was worn out. &ldquo;Can we stop to take a break?&rdquo; she asked tiredly.</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;No. They&rsquo;re chasing us. We can&rsquo;t afford to rest one second.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m tired...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well do you want to be more tired or do you want to die?&rdquo; He grabbed her hand and resumed running.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really can not do this anymore!&rdquo; She fell on her knees and breathed hard.</p>

<p>Tyson made a painful face, then thought of something. &ldquo;Get on my back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are going to carry me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry up.&rdquo; She held onto him tightly as he lifted her. He started to run again, but of course, he was not as fast as before.</p>

<p>(Tyson...) Faith thought. (Thank you so much.)</p>

<p>They reached a cave and entered. Tyson collapsed, and Faith helped him to his feet. &ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo; She saw a wound on his stomach and gasped. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re injured!&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No you&rsquo;re not! It will become infected if not treated.&rdquo; She helped him sit down, leaning against the wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. You don&rsquo;t have to...&rdquo;</p>

<p>She ripped a piece of her dress and bandaged his wound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, really.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet. We don&rsquo;t want the wound to go untreated.&rdquo; She kept on bandaging. Tyson, on the inside, was moved by her actions. It seemed he knew she thought of him more than just a bodyguard.</p>

<p>Faith began to make fire by rubbing sticks together. After much effort, she finally did it. She put her hands near the fire to warm them. &ldquo;You look at you. You should be more careful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try. But you know, in this line of work, I have to put my life at risk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith looked at him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you apologizing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never should have asked my father to give you this job if I&rsquo;d known the enemies would actually attack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson smiled. &ldquo;No, princess. It was a good opportunity. I&rsquo;ve learned and saw many new things thanks to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sometime in the night, they fell asleep.</p>

<p>Drago: (It seems that Blaire has been defeated. No matter, one less student to worry about. I will not let anything delay my plans.) He walked in between the sleeping couple. &ldquo;Sleep well.&rdquo; He could hear Lisa yelling from the other room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me out! Let me ouuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut!!!&rdquo; she screamed, banging her fist on the bubble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet! Don&rsquo;t you have any manners?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You lousy creep! Just wait &lsquo;till I get outta here! I&rsquo;ll teach ya a lesson! Let me go!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quiet I said!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fool. Scream all you want. No one will save you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lisa: &ldquo;Ha ha, you think you won? Even without Tyson or Faith, there are still the rest of us. You&rsquo;re gonna lose!&rdquo; She pointed at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh? I bet my students are killing them as we speak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&#8230;way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With them out of the way, no one will be able to stop Vega. Our ambition has finally been rewarded. We have planned this very carefully, you see. It cannot fail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dawn arrived and the sun lit up the bright sky. Tyson woke up and moaned. He realized Faith&rsquo;s dress was on top of him. &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; He looked at Faith, who&rsquo;s back was facing him. She was wearing thin under clothes. She did this so I could be warm? he thought. She was sneezing. &ldquo;Faith?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned around. &ldquo;Tyson? Good morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, why did you do this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re injured. I didn&rsquo;t want you to get cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Princess Faith...you didn&rsquo;t have to do this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had to.&rdquo; she said, looking down. &ldquo;It was my fault that you&rsquo;re like this. I, I just had to do something for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could&rsquo;ve catched a cold! If anything happens to you, I&rsquo;m responsible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about me. I&rsquo;m fine, see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He handed the dress back to her. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do something like that again. I care about you, don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith was suddenly moved by those words. It was as if she was waiting to hear them. &ldquo;Tyson...thank you for everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my job-&ldquo;</p>

<p>She hugged him. At first he was nervous, but then he hugged back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promise you, princess, I will take you back to the castle safe and sound.&rdquo; They kept on hugging. &ldquo;Hey, let&rsquo;s get some breakfast.&rdquo; He said after the hug.</p>

<p>She nodded in agreement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marianna, accept your defeat and die!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess you will have to learn the hard way.&rdquo; Maxima put her daggers away and laughed. She powered up and blue spirit energy was created from every inch of her body. &ldquo;Behold, my ultimate power!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna felt it like a punch in the guts. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very powerful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maxima became completely energized. She formed an energy ball and threw it at her enemy, and Marianna ran away and got blasted and fell on the ground.</p>

<p>As Maxima was shooting energy balls, Junior was beginning to recover consciousness.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="PF_14_A">14: End of Round Two. Koga's Ambush </span></p></center>
<p>&ldquo;Prepare to die!&rdquo; Maxima said.</p>

<p>Marianna shot an arrow at her but Maxima blasted it into dust with her Spirit Energy Ball.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You weapons are useless against me now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maxima threw energy balls and Marianna ran away. Boom! Boom! They soared to the air and hit each other. Wham! Whack! Bam! Maxima knocked her foe on top of a pillar. She landed and attacked, just as Marianna got up. Wham! Marianna got hit in the face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take this!&rdquo; Marianne shouted, getting up and punching.</p>

<p>Maxima dodged, moving backwards and turning her head. She fired another Spirit Energy ball and Marianna jumped onto the next pillar. Maxima jumped into the air, then kept firing those energy balls. Marianna back flipped away, and the pillars were destroyed one by one. Boom boom boom! Maxima whacked her enemy down and Marianna slammed into a pillar and came out the other side, and continued falling into the ground. Wham!</p>

<p>Marianne was barely conscious. Rock chunks were all over her. She moaned, and opened her eyes. She got up and breathed hard. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t over yet&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time to die!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna flashed back to a time when she was talking with Faith. &ldquo;You must believe in the power of the spirit, Marianna.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Believe in it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Then you can truly become powerful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was gibberish then, but now she understood everything. &ldquo;Yes, I believe!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Believe in what? That you can die? Ha ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great Spirit, please give me the power to defeat her!&rdquo; She became powered up and full of spirit energy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Faith, my good friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maxima grumbled. &ldquo;You think this will save you! En garde!&rdquo; She shot another Spirit Energy ball.</p>

<p>This time, Marianna blocked it just by standing there. Boom! It crashed into her energy shield and exploded, but she was unharmed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you!!!&rdquo; Maxima yelled angrily.</p>

<p>They charged into each other and hit violently like there was no tomorrow.</p>

<p>Junior, hearing Marianna&rsquo;s cries of pain, became more conscious and woke up. &ldquo;Mari-anna&#8230;&rdquo; he called out weakly. The hand from under the rocks started to move. It&rsquo;s no surprise he&rsquo;s mad, since Marianna has been a good friend to him all along. She told him the truth about everything, the truth that even his parents could not tell him. He was truly enraged. The rocks on him bursted upwards and he stood up, with blue energy all over him. &ldquo;Leave my friend alone!&rdquo; he screamed.</p>

<p>Maxima: &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;Huh? Junior?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Junior was grunting angrily.</p>

<p>Maxima, shocked by this sudden surprise, said: &ldquo;How can that kid be so powerful? He&rsquo;s&#8230;just a kid!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Junior charged forward, as fast as a bullet, and as strong as a train. Maxima screamed and jumped up. Marianna knew this was the chance. She jumped and fired a blast with all the energy she had. Maxima saw it, and screamed as the beam engulfed her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!&rdquo; Boom! She fell on the ground with smoke coming from her.</p>

<p>Marianne landed on her knees, breathing hard. Junior walked two steps, then collapsed. She crawled towards him. &ldquo;You did well, kid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, look at what I&rsquo;ve got!&rdquo; Tyson said when he came to the entrance of the cave. He was carrying a handful of fruit and berries. Faith had already set the wood on fire, and was sitting in front of it. &ldquo;Wow, you found a bundle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah. We&rsquo;re lucky this is a rich forest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good job. I am so hungry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us eat, shall we?&rdquo; Tyson said, smiling.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a man appeared behind Tyson. &ldquo;Watch out!&rdquo; Faith yelled.</p>

<p>Tyson, dropping the fruit, turned around and dodged a fist. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I found you two at last.&rdquo; Koga said. &ldquo;It took me all night. So this is where you&rsquo;re hiding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith gasped and screamed.</p>

<p>Tyson backed away, covering Faith. &ldquo;Koga, I am warning you, stay away!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you stay away, you brat. You will not get in my way again.&rdquo; He took out a sword. The princess and her bodyguard stepped back into the cave, being very cautious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hand over the princess or die!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You chose the hard way.&rdquo; Koga attacked, Tyson dodged the deadly blade. He struck again, and Tyson grabbed his hands, and the sword barely touched him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run, princess!&rdquo; yelled Spade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run, now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith ran as the warriors struggled.</p>

<p>Koga: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not getting away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson pushed him against the wall, then ran after the princess. He grabbed her hand. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get outta here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly, the red and blue ninja appeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh crap!&rdquo; said Tyson.</p>

<p>Koga was behind them. &ldquo;You have nowhere to escape now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What now? The hero faced danger on both sides, and he has to protect the princess while fighting. How will they get out of this one? Tyson fought the ninjas, and Koga snatched Faith from him, keeping her in a head lock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help!&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let her go!&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p>Koga: &ldquo;Finish him, boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson fought the ninjas and beat them up. Koga, grabbing Faith, moved back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get away from here if you know what&rsquo;s good for you, boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith bit his arm, and he groaned, and pushed her on the ground, then Tyson charged and punched his face. Pow! They exchanged some moves, then backed away. The ninjas approached Tyson.</p>

<p>Suddenly, an arrow hit the blue ninja and he collapsed.</p>

<p>Koga: &ldquo;What? Who dares?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna and Ace dropped in and landed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Tyson asked.</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;We are loyal friends of the princess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;We came here to help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that true?&rdquo; Tyson asked Faith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know them.&rdquo; she answered.</p>

<p>Marianna: &ldquo;You, take the princess and go now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace threw a metal ball on the ground and it exploded, and gas came out. It made everybody cough and covered their vision. With this chance, Tyson and Faith escaped unharmed.</p>

<p>They ran and ran, looking back every two seconds. They did not see Koga follow them, and assumed they were safe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We lost him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope we do not get lost.&rdquo; Faith said just as they reached the trees.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Koga appeared in front of them, and they gasped in shock. &ldquo;Like I said, there is no escape! If you are smart, princess, you&rsquo;d give yourself in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;I will never hand her over to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faith: (Tyson...)</p>

<p>The two warriors powered up and fought each other. They were evenly matched until Tyson landed a punch to his face. Koga decided to use the moves he&rsquo;s learned from his clan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Koga Clan Secret Technique: Whirlwind Kick!&rdquo; he announced. He started to spin like a top and kicked Tyson several times. His legs were so fast it looked like a gust of wind. Wham! Whack! Bam!</p>

<p>Tyson was knocked into the air, then fell. Faith covered her eyes as he got hit.</p>

<p>The fallen warrior forced himself to get up. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not over yet.&rdquo; he said, wiping blood from his mouth.</p>

<p>Koga and Tyson ran at each other, then jumped and attacked. Koga was about to fire a beam, but Tyson grabbed his arm, and he fired in the wrong direction. It blasted near Faith and she fell off the cliff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faith!!&rdquo; Tyson ignored the fight with Koga and ran down the hill.</p>

<p>Faith rolled down and couldn&rsquo;t control where she fell. Her head collided with a stone and she fell unconscious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Princess!&rdquo; Tyson came and lifted her head. Her forehead was bleeding and he took out a handkerchief and wiped the blood, then caressed the wound. &ldquo;Wake up. Wake up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Koga came down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is all your fault.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never intended to hurt the princess. My orders were to kidnap her. You are the one to blame, boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; He got up and was ready to fight.</p>

<p>Koga looked at the background, then backed away. &ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s time for me to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See ya!&rdquo; Koga ran away into the trees. Tyson turned around and saw the king and his army approach.</p>

<p>Midas stared at Faith and the blood on her head. He pushed Tyson aside and grabbed his daughter and let out a yell. &ldquo;My daughter!&rdquo; He was completely shocked.</p>

<p>Darian: &ldquo;This was your responsibility, bodyguard!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;I did my best to protect her. I swear it, your majesty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is because of you!&rdquo; said Midas. &ldquo;I trusted you with her life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But...but...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Men, take him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soldiers grabbed Tyson. &ldquo;Wait, your majesty, please don&rsquo;t do this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas: &ldquo;This is all your fault! You shall be executed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson was in shock. His entire life flashed before his eyes. &ldquo;What-&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas: &ldquo;Do not worry, my daughter. You are safe now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;P-Please, your majesty, I did what I was supposed to-&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace and Marianne showed up. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Darian: &ldquo;Look at what happened to the princess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson: &ldquo;You gotta help me! The king says I&rsquo;m going to be executed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;That cannot be true, your majesty!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Midas: &ldquo;This is none of your concern.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianne: &ldquo;Please consider it. He risked his life for the princess. He did what</p>

<p>he was supposed to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay out of this!&rdquo; said the angry old man. Or do you want to join him in death?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianna whispered to Ace: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s too upset now. I think we should try to persuade him later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ace: &ldquo;Good idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyson did not say a word. He just stared at the ground with wide open eyes.</p>
