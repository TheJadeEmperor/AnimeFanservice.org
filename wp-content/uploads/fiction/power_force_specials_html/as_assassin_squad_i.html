<p><p>Inside a spaceship in outer space, there was an incoming message from Murai. The commander pressed a button on the keyboard, and a face appeared on the computer screen. The person&rsquo;s face is nothing but a shadow, and his voice disguised.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you my lord.&rdquo; said Commander Blue. &ldquo;What can I do for you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Blue,&rdquo; said the shadow. &ldquo;You are hands down the best assassin in Murai, no, in the entire universe. That is why we can entrust this mission to no other than you and your group.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, my lord?&rdquo; Blue inquired.</p></p>

<p><p>The other three assassins, Navy, Teal, and Aqua were standing behind Blue in a straight line.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I want you to kill a certain man&#8230;a sayan named Tyson Spade.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, is that all?&rdquo; Blue asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s no ordinary sayan. He is a super sayan&#8230; If his powers continue to grow, he will be a threat to the entire Muraian Planet.&rdquo; said the shadow. &ldquo;Your job is to eliminate him.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, of course.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;If you do this, you will receive 100 million units as a reward.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Blue&rsquo;s eyes widened a little. &ldquo;100 million units? I see&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m counting on you, Blue.&rdquo; said the shadow, and then he disappeared.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Blue turned around to face his henchmen. &ldquo;You heard him, right, gentlemen?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Navy: &ldquo;100 million just for a single sayan? Isn&rsquo;t the Council being a bit paranoid?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Teal: &ldquo;They must have lost their nerve.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua: &ldquo;He must be really strong, to have the Council worry so much. We should not underestimate this foe.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Blue: &ldquo;In any case, you have your orders. You know what to do.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>All of them placed one arm over their chest and bowed. &ldquo;Yes commander.&rdquo; Then their bodies began to disappear, fading away into nothingness. Yet they were still there, except that they can no longer be seen by the human eye.</p></p>

<p><p>This assassination group is not called the greatest assassins for nothing, once they have been assigned a mission, they never miss their target.</p></p>

<p><p>As part of his daily routine, Zelfire was meditating under the water fall. Because he does it everyday as part of his training, him being here is a common sight. He has been meditating in this spot ever since Tyson was a kid.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, someone&rsquo;s footsteps touched the water. *Splish* Zelfire suddenly opened his eyes. He could somehow feel that someone&rsquo;s here without sensing their ki. He broke out of his meditative posture and stood up, his eyeballs scanning the area for intruders. But he saw nobody within the vicinity.</p></p>

<p><p>The invisible man charged at him, and his movements caused the water around him to rise up. He punched Zelfire in the stomach. *Thud*</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire jumped up, only to get knocked down by another invisible fighter. He fell onto one of the floating rocks. *Wham*</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, two beams appeared and went after him. Zelfire jumped away, avoiding an explosion.</p></p>

<p><p>Teal was standing on the water, while Navy and Aqua were in the air. They all snickered at Zelfire and how helpless he was against their abilities.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Zelfire shouted. &ldquo;Show yourself!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Aqua hit him in the chest, slamming him into the ground. *Kabam*</p></p>

<p><p>When the smoked cleared, Zelfire was still in one piece, but not unharmed. (Am I fighting some kind of invisible enemy?)</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire closed his eyes and focused on his sixth sense, which is more reliable in situations like these. He pinpointed the location of the enemy&rsquo;s ki, and he&rsquo;s able to determine there&rsquo;s three enemies. However, their ki signals disappeared, which shocked him.</p></p>

<p><p>(What? I can&rsquo;t sense their ki!)</p></p>

<p><p>Without the use of his sixth sense, he truly is helpless. All he could hear was the taunting laughter of the assassins. Zelfire&rsquo;s eyes glanced left and right, but saw nothing that closely resembles a person.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Teal punched him in the face, knocking him against a tree. *Wham* Aqua charged at him and punched him continuously, and Zelfire groaned in pain. *Pow pow pow* The tree behind Zelfire broke apart, and Aqua punched Zelfire through the tree. His feet scraped the ground. *Scccccrrrr* He left a trail of smoke and dirt, as well as leaving rips in his pants.</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire powered up and floated to the sky. He fired a beam into the air, and missed his target completely. Suddenly, a beam came from the trees and he blocked it. *Bam*</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua and Navy shot their beams at the same time, and Zelfire blocked it, but the force was too strong for him to hold. The combined beams pushed him down, knocking him into the river. *Splash*</p></p>

<p><p>It was a critical hit, and there was no telling if he&rsquo;ll come back up. The three assassins turned off their shields, and became visible again.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;These earthlings are so easy.&rdquo; Teal commented.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Like taking candy from a baby.&rdquo; said Navy.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I hope the others will provide some more entertainment for us.&rdquo; said Aqua.</p></p>

<p><p>Macintosh just got into his office after a busy morning. He was still holding a brown bag of bagels and a cup of coffee in his arms. He usually crams whatever food he can into his mouth while checking email in the morning. Then he begins his work while sipping his coffee. This is his usual routine.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, there was a transmission sent to his computer, and a woman&rsquo;s face appeared on the screen. Mac was startled, nearly dropping his coffee.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Macintosh Tori!&rdquo; said Angela. &ldquo;This is Angela, commander of the Galactic Police.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh Miss Angela? What is it? It sounds urgent.&rdquo; he answered.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It is.&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Tyson Spade&rsquo;s friend, right? Well he&rsquo;s in great danger.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well, this is nothing unusual.&rdquo; Mac replied. &ldquo;Tyson always has enemies.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No this is different.&rdquo; said Angela. &ldquo;Assassins from planet Murai have entered the earth &ndash; and these are not your ordinary assassins &ndash; they are professions trained to kill. And they have set their sights on our sayan friend.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tyson is their target?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s correct. One of our police scouts have identified a spaceship entering the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere several hours ago. This spaceship is the same one used by the Assassination Squad. They are group of 3 to 4 bounty hunters who kill for a living. We do not know who their boss is.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh. That&rsquo;s nothing to worry about.&rdquo; Mac replied confidently. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve dealt with enemies like this before.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to understand the severity of the situation.&rdquo; Angela said. &ldquo;Once the Assassination Squad has set their sights on a target, they never miss their target. There have been reports of people who were killed on countless planets &ndash; even those who were protected by machine guns and security guards &ndash; they were killed. No one knows how they did it &ndash; and no one has seen their faces.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Now Macintosh was beginning to worry.</p></p>

<p><p>The Squad was doing one of their routine missions &ndash; to kill a certain politician &ndash; as well as all witnesses. In the living room, there were three dead bodies, all lying in a pool of their own blood. The deed was done by Teal &ndash; the cruelest one out of The Squad &ndash; for he had a thirst for blood that can never be satisfied.</p></p>

<p><p>A woman was squirming in the corner, frightened and in shock. Teal walked over to her and smiled wickedly. The poor woman pleaded for her life. &ldquo;No&#8230;please&#8230;don&rsquo;t do it! Spare me!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Teal opened his palms and fired a beam at her. Bam!</p></p>

<p><p>Teal pressed a button on his wrist. &ldquo;Mission accomplished.&rdquo; Then he turned invisible and walked away from the house.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No one has even seen their faces?&rdquo; Mac replied, bewildered. &ldquo;How can that be?&rdquo;<br>  &ldquo;They must do their work really fast.&rdquo; replied Angela. &ldquo;But there are rumors that they have new technology that makes them invisible.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Invisible&#8230;?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This kind of technology shouldn&rsquo;t exist. Yet somehow they have access to it.&rdquo; said Angela. &ldquo;I will give your more details once we do more research. In the meanwhile, don&rsquo;t get yourselves killed.&rdquo; The transmission ended.</p></p>

<p><p>Mac just sat there, absorbing the message that just transpired. Then he suddenly stood up from his chair. &ldquo;I have to warn Tyson now&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Mac felt a force gripping him by the neck, and lifting him off the floor. &ldquo;Ughhh!!&rdquo; It felt like a hand was holding his neck, yet there was no one there.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Navy revealed himself, and he continued to strangle him. Macintosh grabbed Teal&rsquo;s hand and sent thousands of volts of electricity to his hand. Teal screamed from the pain, and dropped him.</p></p>

<p><p>Mac gasped for air. Teal punched him in the stomach, knocking him against the main computer, causing it to short circuit. *Wham!*</p></p>

<p><p>Navy laughed, and became invisible again.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula was walking down the street, casually eating an apple. Suddenly, he heard the sounds of a woman screaming. He tossed away the apple and ran to scene.</p></p>

<p><p>In an abandoned alley, two men were robbing an old woman. She was reluctant to give them her purse.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Stay away from me!&rdquo; she hollered at them.</p></p>

<p><p>The first robber tried to pull the purse from her, and she tried her best to keep it from him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hey you!&rdquo; Nebula shouted.</p></p>

<p><p>The old woman and the robber stopped struggling. The second robber walked over to Nebula. &ldquo;This is none of your business. So scram, boy.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying to rob an old lady?&rdquo; said Nebula. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty low, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The robber grabbed Nebula by the collar. &ldquo;I said it&rsquo;s none of your business!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula grabbed the guy&rsquo;s hand and pulled it off his collar. The robber felt his hand being crushed. &ldquo;Ughhh!! Uhhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How about you let the old lady go and nobody gets hurt.&rdquo; He twisted the robber&rsquo;s hand, bending his arm.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ughhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The robber made a punch, and Nebula blocked it, and squeezed that hand.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula then head butt him. *Thud* Blood oozed out of his nose and he fell down.</p></p>

<p><p>The first robber took out a pocket knife. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re dead now, boy!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He charged at Nebula and slashed, Nebula dodged, grabbed the robber&rsquo;s hand, and squeezed it, making him drop the knife. Then Nebula punched him in the stomach. *Thud*</p></p>

<p><p>The old woman approached Nebula. &ldquo;Oh thank you, thank you young man.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No problem. I&rsquo;m just doing the right thing.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;If only there were more people like you in the world.&rdquo; the old lady replied. And she went on her way.</p></p>

<p><p>The robbers got up. &ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t over, punk!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Why, you want some more?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The robbers gasped and ran away.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tch. What a bunch of idiots.&rdquo; Nebula put his hands back in his pocket, the same posture he held when he first walked into the alley.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, he sensed two ki&rsquo;s nearby. He took his hands out of his pocket and became fully alert. This ki is different than what he normally feels. The signal is strong, meaning it&rsquo;s a strong enemy. But then the ki signals disappeared, making him confused.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula looked around, but saw no one. Suddenly, from out of no where, an energy ball flew at him. He smacked it away, the ball hit the wall and exploded. *Bam*</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; Nebula&rsquo;s eyeballs glanced the area but he saw no one. &ldquo;Grrrr. Show yourself!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Three energy balls came from above, and Nebula jumped out of harm&rsquo;s way. *Bam bam bam*</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula blurred and appeared in the air. Having a bird&rsquo;s eye view of the alley did no good, as there is no enemy to be seen. Suddenly, Teal hit him from the back. *Whack* He was knocked down into the ground. *Wham*</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula stood up, a bit dazed. *Pow* Something struck his chest, it felt like a fist, yet no one was in front of him. Aqua hit him continuously in the stomach, pushing him back with each punch. Then he finished the combo with a hard punch, knocking Nebula into the wall. *Wham* The wall cracked and bricks fell out. Nebula then fell down face flat.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson turned on the hose and let the water splash on the flowers. Inside the house, Faith was doing the dishes while humming a tune. Once finished with his chore, he came back into the kitchen. &ldquo;Honey, I finished watering the daisies.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; she replied.</p></p>

<p><p>The hose valve was not completely shut, and water squirted out of the nozzle and hit Faith. *Splish*</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; she cried out.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sorry Faith.&rdquo; Tyson replied, covering the hole with his hand.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Be careful with that.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Just now, Tyson had a mischievous thought. He pointed the hose at her and the water squirted on her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hey! Stop!&rdquo; she said, covering her face with her arm.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson laughed as he continued to spray her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Faith cried out, running across the room. But Tyson did not stop, rather, he continued to point the hose at her.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith ran towards him and grabbed the hose from his hand. They tried to pull it away from each other, fighting like two kids would fight over a toy. The hose was under Tyson&rsquo;s chin and it sprayed him. His face was wet and so was his hair.</p></p>

<p><p>Upon seeing that, Faith laughed at him. Tyson made a frown and grabbed the hose from her, and sprayed her. She winced while laughing.</p></p>

<p><p>When they both had enough fun, they dropped the hose on the floor. The entire kitchen was wet and it would hours just to dry it off. Faith, who is responsible for the cleanliness of the house, would normally be upset, but she had so much fun she forgot about the room.</p></p>

<p><p>They were both wet, especially Faith who got sprayed the most. Now they both stared at each other. Tyson noticed that Faith&rsquo;s clothes were all wet, but he liked this look. Her pink shoes, and above that, her legs, which were dripping wet. Her legs were long and sexy, especially when wet. And above that, her short, pink skirt, and her pink blouse. It was a thin blouse, so it was partially see-through. He could see the shape of her bra. And above that, her beautiful face, a face that no straight man could resist. Those luscious lips, and those smooth cheeks, and her eyes, those big bright eyes. Her hair was wet too &ndash; it looked as if she just came out of the shower. Tyson liked this look about her, it was a turn on.</p></p>

<p><p>They both stared into each other&rsquo;s eyes. How beautiful her eyes are - they are innocent, yet playful, and full of maturity. And today there was something different about her eyes - they were full of passion and desire - and the person she desires is standing right before her. Her expression was priceless, and Tyson could not resist those eyes of hers.</p></p>

<p><p>They grabbed each other and kissed passionately, Faith held onto his neck, Tyson&rsquo;s arms wrapped around her back, holding her body close to his. They did not care about being wet, for the flames of passion are burning intensely today. Then Tyson pushed her against the wall, and they stared into each other&rsquo;s eyes, and continued kissing wildly.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson lifted her up, removing her from the wall and placed her on the floor, where they continued to kiss and move about. The floor was wet, and Faith slipped, dragging Tyson down with her. *Thud*</p></p>

<p><p>Now they were lying down with Tyson on top of her. Their legs were intertwined, and his face was directly above hers, and they were close enough to feel each other&rsquo;s breath. They gazed into each other&rsquo;s eyes for a moment, and everything was completely silent. As Faith gazed into Tyson&rsquo;s eyes, she could feel his strength and sincerity, and forgot about all the chores that she had to do.</p></p>

<p><p>Her heart was beating rapidly - beating so hard it could jump out of her chest. She was excited and scared at the same time, and she just laid there, not moving a muscle.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Tyson sensed danger. Nebula&rsquo;s ki was fading away. &ldquo;Sorry&#8230;&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I have to go&#8230;&rdquo; He got off of her and ran towards the door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back before supper, I promise.&rdquo; With that said, he ran out of the house and flew away.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith sat up and reflected on what just transpired. It all happened so fast she almost forgot that she was on the floor and that she&rsquo;s wet all over. What a shame, that they were just about to get it on, when he has to leave. But now that he&rsquo;s gone, she&rsquo;s kind of relieved, yet disappointed at the same time. Disappointed that they didn&rsquo;t get to make passionate love to each other.</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua lifted Nebula up by his collar. &ldquo;Where is the one called Tyson Spade?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tyson Spade? You&rsquo;re looking for him?&rdquo; Nebula moaned with whatever strength he had left.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You should know where he is. Our sources tell us you&rsquo;re like family to him.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula laughed. &ldquo;Even if you do find him, you&rsquo;re no match for him.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, is that so?&rdquo; Aqua threw Nebula against the wall. *Thud*</p></p>

<p><p>At this point, Nebula was battered and bruised, and unable to even stand up. Blood was dripping from the corner of his lips.</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua opened his palm. &ldquo;You gonna talk or should I blow you to smithereens?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Teal put his arm in front of Aqua. &ldquo;I have a better idea. Commander Blue mentioned that Tyson has a girlfriend who lives with him. If we can get her, then he will surely show up.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Good idea.&rdquo; Aqua said, smiling wickedly. They both turned around.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Leaving so soon?&rdquo; Nebula inquired.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmph. You&rsquo;re not our target. Besides, trash like you is not worth killing.&rdquo; said Teal. Both of them turned invisible and walked away.</p></p>

<p><p>Moments later, Tyson landed in the alley. &ldquo;Nebula! Oh my God! You alright?&rdquo; He turned Nebula over.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, bro.&rdquo; he replied, ignoring the pain. &ldquo;But we sure have our hands full this time.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who did this to you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But they are tough opponents. They can turn invisible.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Invisible?&rdquo; Tyson repeated blankly.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. You can&rsquo;t see them with the naked eye.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get you to a hospital.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula grabbed him by the sleeve. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re looking for you, Tyson. So be careful. And one more thing, they mentioned someone named Commander Blue. That&rsquo;s all I know.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Commander Blue?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson took Nebula to Macintosh&rsquo;s lab, but upon arrival, he saw the collateral damage. &ldquo;What happened here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I was attacked.&rdquo; Mac replied, a little depressed. &ldquo;By someone invisible.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You too?&rdquo; said Tyson.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Me too? Don&rsquo;t tell me&#8230;&rdquo; As Mac saw Nebula&rsquo;s condition, he figured out the truth. &ldquo;What about you, Tyson? Did they come after you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re their primary target. They&rsquo;re going to come after you next.&rdquo; said Mac.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson placed Nebula on the bed chamber. &ldquo;Just who exactly are they?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Angela sent me a message earlier this morning.&rdquo;<br>  &ldquo;Angela Lianz from the Galactic Police?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Macintosh nodded. &ldquo;These guys are no joke - they&rsquo;re the Assassin Squad - warriors who can turn invisible upon command. They were sent here from Murai.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Upon hearing that name, Tyson showed a reaction. His disgruntled face revealed how dangerous the situation is. &ldquo;Murai&#8230;the planet that started the Great War - the war that lasted a century. Those guys are always up to no good.&rdquo;</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="c">[ C ] - Eye of the Beholder </span></p></center>

<p><p><a name=&quot;AS1_Faith_Shower&quot;></a>Faith Takes A Shower</p></p>

<p><p>Faith turned on the knob and let the hot water run on her naked body. The nuzzle sprayed hot water on her. Taking a hot shower feels good, it&rsquo;s very relaxing, and she can melt all her problems away. She was looking up with her eyes closed, and let the hot water hit her face &ndash; the water ran down her eyes, her nose, her lips, and her chin.</p></p>

<p><p>The water continued its course down her neck, her shoulders, and her arms. Her arms covered her breasts. The water ran down her stomach, and down to her waist, her thighs, and her knees, and her ankles.</p></p>

<p><p>Her complexion is creamy and smooth, and Faith prides herself on her appearance. A woman likes to stay beautiful to impress her man. If she takes good care of her body, her man will be happy, and she will be happy.</p></p>

<p><p>Now they were lying down with Tyson on top of her. Their legs were intertwined, and his face was directly above hers, and they were close enough to feel each other&rsquo;s breath. They gazed into each other&rsquo;s eyes for a moment, and everything was completely silent. As Faith gazed into Tyson&rsquo;s eyes, she could feel his strength and sincerity, and forgot about all the chores that she had to do.</p></p>

<p><p>Her heart was beating rapidly - beating so hard it could jump out of her chest. She was excited and scared at the same time, and she just laid there, not moving a muscle.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Tyson sensed danger. Nebula&rsquo;s ki was fading away. &ldquo;Sorry&#8230;&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I have to go&#8230;&rdquo; He got off of her and ran towards the door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back before supper, I promise.&rdquo; With that said, he ran out of the house and flew away.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith sat up and reflected on what just transpired. It all happened so fast she almost forgot that she was on the floor and that she&rsquo;s wet all over. What a shame, that they were just about to get it on, when he has to leave. But now that he&rsquo;s gone, she&rsquo;s kind of relieved, yet disappointed at the same time. Disappointed that they didn&rsquo;t get to make passionate love to each other.</p></p>

<p><p>When she was satisfied, Faith turned off the water and grabbed a towel from the shelf. She put the pink towel around herself and tied the end of it on the side of her chest. She checked herself out in the mirror, and when satisfied, she opened the door to exit.</p></p>

<p><p>Navy was inside the kitchen, observing everything silently. Steam was coming out of the bathroom and he wondered who&rsquo;s going to come out. To his surprise, it was a beautiful woman in a towel. Today must be his lucky day, he thought, with such eye candy to behold.</p></p>

<p><p>Other than a pink towel clinging onto her, she was naked. She was still dripping wet from the shower, and there were water droplets all over her body. Navy&rsquo;s jaw nearly dropped as he stared at the water droplets on her breasts.</p></p>

<p><p>The image of her and Tyson being close together was still stuck in her mind. And she touched her lips with her fingers, as if she could still feel Tyson&rsquo;s lips on them.</p></p>

<p><p>Then she got a great idea. The way to a man&rsquo;s heart is his stomach. So she could fix him something good, a meal he&rsquo;ll never forget. And then they can have a romantic night together. They will have a great meal, and talk about romantic stuff, tell silly jokes and make each other laugh. And after the meal&#8230;they can get into bed, and then&#8230; well that&rsquo;s up to the imagination.</p></p>

<p><p>The mere thought of Tyson being so close to her makes her jittery. Faith opened the fridge and took out a jar of pickles. She turned the cover, but it wouldn&rsquo;t move, so she turned it harder. The thing was tight, and she struggled to open it.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, she sensed a hostile presence nearby. This presence struck her head like a thunderbolt. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; She threw the jar at the direction of the threat.</p></p>

<p><p>*Crack* Navy blocked the jar, breaking it into pieces. Then he became visible.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You have sharp senses.&rdquo; said Navy.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith gasped in surprise. All of a sudden, there was man in her kitchen. Navy</p></p>

<p><p>approached her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, no&#8230;&rdquo; Faith&rsquo;s back was against the kitchen counter, and she stood there like a deer in headlights as he inched his way towards her. &ldquo;No&#8230;&rdquo; Her hands covered her breasts instinctively, holding onto her towel. This thin piece of cloth clad to her diminutive frame is the only protection she has.</p></p>

<p><p>Navy grabbed her shoulders. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re no ordinary woman, are you?&rdquo; Then he forced his lips into hers.</p></p>

<p><p>Her lips tasted very good, and he enjoyed it. Faith&rsquo;s eyes stayed wide open from the shock and pain. This stranger was kissing her, and to top that off, she was practically naked, wearing only a towel. This thin piece of fabric is the only thing separating her and Navy.</p></p>

<p><p>Navy continued to swallow her lips, wildly, chewing them like candy, while his hands held her arms in place. With her arms in lockdown, her hands were pushing against his chest. But she was unable to do anything.</p></p>

<p><p>The longer he kissed her, the more turned on her became, and he put his hand on her thigh and felt her up. His hand went up her thigh and into the towel, while still kissing her.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith squirmed in discomfort, as she was being violated by this stranger, with his hand fumbling around between her legs.</p></p>

<p><p>She managed to shove him away. Navy grabbed her wrists, and slammed her against the fridge. He pushed her arms above her head, locking them in place. His body was leaning against hers, and her arms were trapped, and he was face to face with her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mine!&rdquo; he said, grinning.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aaah!&rdquo; she shrieked, turning her head sideways. The only man who should ever touch her lips is the one she loves&#8230;but this stranger just stole a kiss from her. But that was only the beginning, Navy still wants to do other things to her body. Faith panicked, her eyes shaking, and her heart beating rapidly. She couldn&rsquo;t even imagine being violated by this stranger any further.</p></p>

<p><p>Out of her fear came anger, and suddenly, her ki started to rise. Her eyes flashed a pink color, and suddenly, the ki traveled throughout her body.</p></p>

<p><p>Navy could sense her rising energy level, and feel his hands burning because they were touching hers. Suddenly, she screamed, releasing a burst of energy which pushed Navy away.</p></p>

<p><p>He checked his wrist scouter. &ldquo;Such a reading&#8230;you&rsquo;re definitely no ordinary woman.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> Faith was angry that he stole a kiss from her, and it&rsquo;s time for payback. She got into fighting stance.</p></p>

<p><p>Navy was amused that she&rsquo;s angry. &ldquo;Oh, you want to fight? What can you possibly do&#8230;while wearing that?&rdquo; he taunted, pointing at her towel.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith ran at him and punched, Navy dodged to the side. *Whoosh* She immediately turned around and did a high kick. Navy blocked, but he was knocked against the fridge. *Wham*</p></p>

<p><p>She waited for him to make his move. Navy was a bit annoyed that this woman, who&rsquo;s supposed to be helpless, actually landed a hit on him.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Faith sensed another person outside the house. She realized that staying inside the house will be detrimental to her safety, since she will be surrounded. Faith jumped up to the ceiling, making a hole, and landed on the roof.</p></p>

<p><p> Navy did the same, and landed on the roof. They got into fighting stance and jumped and hit in the air. *Wham*</p></p>

<p><p>Navy landed, but his belt had electric sparks. It was damaged during the hit. &ldquo;Tch.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith sensed two others approaching her &ndash; yet she could not see them. She looked everywhere but saw no one. She had no time to decide, so she jumped onto the grass fields, her left arm clinging to her towel to keep it from falling off.</p></p>

<p><p>She ran at high speed towards the other side. *Doosh doosh*</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua revealed himself, running on her left. And Teal revealed himself, running on her right side.</p></p>

<p><p>(They can turn invisible?)</p></p>

<p><p>Faith can see that they were keeping up with her speed, so running any further would be pointless. So she stopped running, and Teal and Aqua also stopped.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith got into fighting stance, bending her knees and putting her fists up.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oooh what do we have here?&rdquo; said Teal, showing a wide grin. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you a bit under dressed?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to see what&rsquo;s under that towel. He he he he.&rdquo; said Aqua.</p></p>

<p><p>In the heat of the action, Faith almost forgot that she&rsquo;s wearing a towel, and she looked down and became embarrassed. She realized that much of her skin was showing - and her face was blushing red. Even though all the important parts are covered, she felt no different than being naked.</p></p>

<p><p>Out of the three, Aqua was the most violent one, as well as the most perverted one. &ldquo;I want to see her naked. And feel those breasts of hers. Heh heheh.&rdquo; He licked his lips.</p></p>

<p><p>At first, Faith was stunned, not knowing what to do in a situation like this. It&rsquo;s not like she had a choice in the matter. But as they continued to taunt her while staring at her figure in lewd ways, she grew angry and clenched her fist.</p></p>

<p><p>At this point, she had no choice but to fight...it was her only option to get out of this compromising situation.</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua continued the teasing. &ldquo;I want to feel up those legs of hers. Oh, they are so nice.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s anger grew even more, and she released her ki. A pink aura surrounded her body.</p></p>

<p><p>Teal charged forward, and Faith bounced up in the air to do a flying kick. *Whoosh* For a split second, Teal saw what was underneath her towel, and became distracted. She kicked him in face, knocking him down.</p></p>

<p><p>She used the momentum of the kick to do a backwards somersault and landed on the ground in a crouch position.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How careless of you.&rdquo; said Aqua.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It was totally worth it.&rdquo; Teal muttered in a daze.</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua charged at her, punching left and right. Faith evaded the punches and jumped back. Aqua charged at her. Then she did a high kick, hitting him in the chin. *Wham* He fell down on the grass.</p></p>

<p><p>Navy showed up. &ldquo;Look at you guys, you can&rsquo;t even handle one woman.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Teal wiped the saliva off his chin. &ldquo;Grrr we&rsquo;ve got it handled. Just watch!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua and Teal turned invisible and ran at her. Faith panicked, unable to see them. Not only did she have to fight in a towel, but now she&rsquo;s against invisible enemies. Things have taken a turn for the worst for our heroine.</p></p>

<p><p>Using her quick thinking and lighting fast reflexes, she powered up and formed an energy shield around her. The shield expanded as her power grew. Aqua and Teal leapt onto her shield and they were hit, and they became visible. The shield electrified them and tossed them away.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So she&rsquo;s Tyson Spade&rsquo;s woman, huh?&rdquo; Navy commented. &ldquo;Did she learn that move from him?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;AS1_The_Crater&quot;></a>The Crater</p></p>

<p><p>Faith continued to power up, releasing all the ki she had in reserve. Electric sparks flared from her body. *Froom* The shield continued to expand little by little, and with each passing second, its power increased dramatically.</p></p>

<p><p>The assassins winced from the excess wind. They were bewildered by her abilities.</p></p>

<p><p>Navy&rsquo;s jaw nearly dropped as he checked his scouter. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be&#8230;how can this woman have such a high power level?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua and Teal were just as shocked as he was. But it&rsquo;s still too early to be surprised &ndash; because she still has a lot of unused ki left to be summoned.</p></p>

<p><p>As Faith powered up, she grunted heavily, as the energy puts a strain on her body. Her legs were bent, her elbows bent, her fists clenched tightly. Her body produced electric sparks as powerful as 10,000 volts of electricity. Zzzzzzzzzt. Even the ground began to shake.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith released a shockwave, screaming at the top of her lungs. &ldquo;Hyaaaaaah!&rdquo; She exploded as if she was a bomb, destroying the landscape around her. *Boom* The assassins winced and covered their eyes from the brightness.</p></p>

<p><p>All that&rsquo;s left of the grass fields was a big crater, with Faith in the center of it. Chunks of dirt and rock floated up all around Faith, and the electricity smashed them into pieces.</p></p>

<p><p>The assassins, still standing on the crater, were bewildered. Teal clenched his fists in disbelief, as he can clearly see this woman&rsquo;s power. Navy checked her power reading again, and he grunted angrily.</p></p>

<p><p>As her power increased, more rock chunks floated up. The electricity from her body became more intense, turning into a vibrant pink color.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, the knot in her towel was loose, and the towel fell to the ground. Faith looked down and gasped. Everyone&rsquo;s jaw dropped as they stared at her naked form. Her curves and her proportions where nearly perfect, her breasts were neither too big nor too small.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was so embarrassed that she screamed out loud. Instinctively she covered her body with her hands. All the electricity disappeared, and the rock chunks dropped to the ground. She fell to her knees, with one hand over her breasts and one hand over her vagina.</p></p>

<p><p>The villains were bewildered, still staring at her naked form. She quickly grabbed the towel and clenched it close to her body.</p></p>

<p><p>Navy slid down the crater, and Aqua and Teal followed. *Sccrrrrrrrrch*</p></p>

<p><p>Faith got up and put the towel around herself and ran away...there wasn&rsquo;t time to tie the knot on the towel, so her left hand was clenching it against her breasts.</p></p>

<p><p>Navy dashed past her and appeared in front of her. Faith gasped.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Even with all that power, you&rsquo;re still just a woman after all.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He let out a series of punches and Faith dodged, tilting her head left and right. *Whoosh whoosh whoosh*</p></p>

<p><p>In this situation, she could only defend with her right hand. If she used both hands, then her towel will slip and fall off again. Things have taken a turn for the worst, for now she cannot even afford to attack. Not getting hit was hard enough, but now she had to worry about her towel slipping off her body.</p></p>

<p><p>She retreated several steps back and bumped into something invisible. Teal became visible and snickered at her. Faith quickly turned around and stepped back from him. She punched and Teal blurred.</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua appeared behind her and chuckled. Faith gasped and turned around to face him. She punched and he blurred out of sight.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Missed me. Heh heh heh.&rdquo; Aqua taunted.</p></p>

<p><p>Then Teal appeared. &ldquo;Over here!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith punched at him, but he disappeared.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Over here!&rdquo; said Navy. She punched at him, but he blurred.</p></p>

<p><p>The villains kept snickering at her as she was attacking in vain. It was clear they were all toying with her, and this made her upset. But no matter how hard she punched, it was no good if she can&rsquo;t land a hit.</p></p>

<p><p>The villains continued to mock her while hiding behind their invisibility. They would appear and disappear at random, and her eyes couldn&rsquo;t keep up with their speed.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith tied the knot on her towel and stood in fighting position. Suddenly, Aqua appeared in front of her, and kicked him. But he blurred out of sight. She stepped back a few paces and bumped into someone. Teal became visible and grabbed her breasts.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ughhhh...aaaah!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ohh they feel so nice.&rdquo; He squeezed them tightly like pork buns. &ldquo;So round and soft.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Navy and Aqua cheered him on.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s arms were trapped under his arms, and she couldn&rsquo;t resist. &ldquo;Ughhh! Uhhhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Then Teal&rsquo;s hand moved a little lower and touched her thigh. &ldquo;I wonder how soft this spot is...&rdquo; His hand went up the towel into that spot...and she groaned in pain. His left hand was squeezing her breast while his right hand was rummaging in her vital spot.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ughhh!!! Ughhh!!&rdquo; she screamed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Pull it off! Pull it off&rdquo; Aqua cheered on.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I want to see her naked!&rdquo; Navy added.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was at her limit and she couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore. Suddenly, she screamed out loud and her arms managed to push his arms away, shoving them to the side. She immediately elbowed him in the stomach. *Thud*</p></p>

<p><p>Teal grabbed his wound and grunted in pain while she moved away from him. &ldquo;Ugh...that hurts bitch...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua appeared behind her and kicked her in the back. *Whack* She stuttered forward into Navy, who caught her in his arms. Then he shoved her into Teal. Then Teal shoved her into Aqua. They all laughed at her as they pushed her around.</p></p>

<p><p>The poor girl didn&rsquo;t even have a moment&rsquo;s rest, and she was too tired to defend herself or do anything against their bullying. They kept shoving her back and forth while she moaned and shrieked.</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua pushed her into Navy, who grabbed her by the forearms. He locked her arms under his arms and pulled her closer to him. Navy forced his lips into hers.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mmmmmffff!!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Then he shoved her, causing her to fall down on her bottom.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The three villains stood together, all smiling at her. Faith crawled backwards.</p></p>

<p><p>Navy then folded his hands and interlocking his fingers, forming a hammer. Consequently, Faith was lifted off the ground, floating into the air like a helpless puppet. Telekinesis is also one of his abilities, although limited. He can lift only one object at a time, and he has to concentrate on it fully. His arms remained fixed in that position, fingers interlocked, to keep the woman afloat.</p></p>

<p><p>Despite that, her hands still clasped onto the towel.</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua: &ldquo;Heheh. She&rsquo;s still holding onto her towel.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Teal: &ldquo;Well let&rsquo;s see how long she can last, shall we?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He used basic telekinesis to lift up some rocks from the ground. The rocks floated close to her. Then he made the rocks hit her in the forearms. Even though the distance was close, the speed of the rocks hurt her arms. *Pak pak pak*</p></p>

<p><p>Teal lifted up more rocks and used her as target practice. The rocks hit her arms and shoulders and legs. Navy and Aqua laughed.</p></p>

<p><p>Navy then unlocked his fingers and pulled them apart. Faith lost control of her body. An invisible force was controlling her. Her arms extended to the side and her legs spread out diagonally. &ldquo;Uhhhh...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Teal lifted up more rocks and made them fly to her. Many hit her thighs and shin. Some hit her arms. Some hit her breasts. She moaned from the pain. One hit her on the forehead.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, the towel knot slipped and her towel fell off. *Plop* It fell to the ground. What a spectacle it is for these men, as they leered at her naked body from top to bottom. They were laughing and chuckling while getting some good eye candy.</p></p>

<p><p>Teal: &ldquo;Ohhhh! Nice...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua: &ldquo;I bet her skin tastes good. I want to lick her all over!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith screamed and somehow regained control of her arms, and quickly covered her breasts and her sacred spot. She fell to the ground on her knees.</p></p>

<p><p>Navy put the towel on his face and smelled it and sighed in pleasure. &ldquo;Who knew this would be your weakness. Heh heh heh.&rdquo; He tossed the towel over to Teal.</p></p>

<p><p>At this point, the fight is over, for she cannot fight back anymore. Faith, now kneeling, has one arm over her breasts, and her other hand over her vagina.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith just stared at them like a deer in headlights. Fighting in a towel was the last thing she wanted to do, but now, without her towel, there is no way she can fight. Their staring was uncomfortable and made her embarrassed. Her face was blushing, showing a bright red color, and her eyes were shaking nervously, on the verge of tears.</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua was getting turned on just by leering at Faith. He liked her complexion, her peach colored skin, and how smooth it is. &ldquo;Heh heh. We should have some fun with her.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Navy walked over to Faith, who was trembling in fear. He bent down to her level and grabbed her chin and made her look at him at eye level.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Our leader, Blue, wants to have a word with you.&rdquo; He kissed her lips.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mmmmfff!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Navy turned his back on her to walk a few steps. &ldquo;Commander Blue ordered us to take you to him. But before that&#8230;we need a little compensation for the trouble you&rsquo;ve caused us.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua came behind Faith and yanked her hair, pulling her head up, causing her to moan. While yanking her hair, he made her head move up and down. He was snickering and laughing the whole time. Her hands were covering up her privates, so she was unable to do anything.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ahh...ahhh!&rdquo; she moaned.</p></p>

<p><p>She was wincing from the pain of having her hair being yanked back and forth. Her eyes seemed closed and her face was in a grimace.</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua put his arm around her shoulder and he put his face into her hair and sniffed it.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mmmm you smell good.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was still wincing. She was grossed out that this man was smelling her...especially in such a perverted way. She just finished putting shampoo in her hair during the shower. She wants to smell good for one man and one man only...she did not wash her hair so some pervert can smell her like this.</p></p>

<p><p>His other hand grabbed her right arm, trying to pry it off her chest, but her arm would not budge no matter what.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh heh. I bet you taste good too.&rdquo; Aqua placed his tongue on her shoulder and licked her shoulder and her neck.</p></p>

<p><p>She turned the other way, wincing and shrieking. &ldquo;Ugh&#8230;uhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He kept licking her skin until his tongue reached her face. Faith was completely disgusted by his filthy tongue, but there was nothing she could do about it.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith always takes care of her skin...she always puts on lotion and rubs it all over her body...and when she showers, she washes every part thoroughly. To have smooth skin is not an easy task, it requires constant maintenance and due diligence. She is pretty proud of her skin, one can say it is a woman&rsquo;s pride.</p></p>

<p><p>This is definitely not her day, to have to feel this villain&rsquo;s slimy, disgusting tongue on her fair skin. All that effort has gone to waste...her skin was not meant to be licked and violated in such a way...</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now show us the goods. Heh heh.&rdquo; Aqua grabbed her left hand, trying to pry it off her private parts, but they won&rsquo;t budge. Her right hand won&rsquo;t budge either, as if they were glued to her body.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So stubborn, eh?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He put Faith in a headlock, wrapping his muscular arm around her neck. Then he stood up, forcing her to stand up. All this time, her hands still covered her breasts and her vagina.</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua tried to pry her hand off her vagina, but it won&rsquo;t budge. Even in her situation, she still has to cover herself...it&rsquo;s the only thing she can do.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Look, she&rsquo;s still trying to hold onto her dignity.&rdquo; said Teal.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s embarrassed. How cute.&rdquo; said Navy.</p></p>

<p><p>They all continued to chuckle and mock her with lewd comments.</p></p>

<p><p>*Thud* Faith felt a sudden pain in her lower back. Aqua punched her at point blank, knocking the wind out of her. She can no longer stand up, and fell on her knees.</p></p>

<p><p>Even though she was naked and defenseless, Aqua showed no mercy to her. Out of all the squad members, he is the most violent one, as well as the most perverted.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was on her knees again, her arms still covering her private parts. Aqua was standing behind her, and she can&rsquo;t see him, but she can sense the evil intentions.</p></p>

<p><p>He did a karate chop on her neck. *Whack* Faith fell on the dust face forward. Now Faith was lying face down, biting the dust.</p></p>

<p><p>Navy was sitting on a rock with his arms and legs crossed, watching the show.</p></p>

<p><p>Her situation was getting worse and worse...and now she&rsquo;s in a more compromising position. Aqua stomped her butt, causing her a lot of pain. *Wham* She screamed in agony. He kept on stomping her without holding back at all. &ldquo;AAAH! AAAH!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He stomped her so hard, her body convulsed, and her limbs and head sprang up at the moment of impact. *Wham wham* He was enjoying this very much. Faith&rsquo;s body became gradually embedded into the concrete.</p></p>

<p><p>Finally, Aqua stopped to take a break. Faith was panting for breath, barely conscious from the beating. But it was far from over.</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua kicked her in the chest. *Thud* He kicked her in the stomach. &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; Aqua enjoyed her screams and the feeling of kicking her frail, soft body, so he kept doing it over and over. Poor Faith moaned and groaned in agony.</p></p>

<p><p>It was too much to handle all at once...tears drip down her eyes. &ldquo;Ugh...Ugh...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua gave her a heavy kick, causing her to roll away. *Doosh doosh*</p></p>

<p><p>At this point, there was only one thing she could do. She tried to crawl away, and tried she did. She was tired and beaten up, and crawled no more than a few inches, despite how hard she tried.</p></p>

<p><p>But Aqua was still not satisfied, even after kicking her so badly. He Aqua used telekinesis to lift up some rocks and shot them at her one by one. The rocks hit various parts of her naked body. He showed no mercy at all to this poor woman, caring only about his amusement. Some of the rocks hit her lower back. She groaned from the pain. &ldquo;Ugh...ugh...&rdquo; Some rocks hit her butt. &ldquo;Ugh...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Despite the pain, she continued to crawl, using all of her strength...but it was no use. She was too slow to avoid the onslaught. More rocks flew at her, hitting her in various places.</p></p>

<p><p>Her frail body wasn&rsquo;t meant for such punishment. Her legs were supposed to be smooth and flawless, but now filled with bruises and dirt...and her whole body had bruises all over.</p></p>

<p><p>This torture is even worst than last time the rocks hit her. At least last time, she could see the rocks. This time, she can&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s coming at her...and has no idea how long the torture is going to be...</p></p>

<p><p>Faith saw a pair of feet in front of her and looked up. It was Teal, who was looking down at her with a mean look on his face.</p></p>

<p><p>She grabbed his ankle with both hands. &ldquo;Please...help...&rdquo; she whimpered, with tears streaming down her eyes. She was already at her limit, and can&rsquo;t handle any more torture. She was naked, tired, and beat up, and at this point, was willing to do anything to make them stop.</p></p>

<p><p>But Teal did not care about her suffering so he shook her hands off his feet. The mean look turned into an evil grin. He stepped on her right hand and squished it, causing her much pain. &ldquo;Ugh! Aaah...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Teal twisted his toes left and right, squishing her fingers and knuckles. She screamed from the agony of having her soft and delicate hand being treated in such a brutal way. As a woman, she always takes care of her hands...she constantly paint her nails, rub lotion on her hands and always made her hands smelled nice. But all that effort has gone to waste...</p></p>

<p><p>Then she felt someone&rsquo;s hand grab her ankles. Behind her, Aqua held her ankles and dragged her body towards him. Faith&rsquo;s fingers grabbed the dirt, offering a futile resistance. He dragged her body through the dirt, while she cried and pleaded. &ldquo;No...please!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He then lifted her upside down by the ankles. Her entire backside was shown and all the villains snickered at her. They liked the view, especially Aqua, who had a close up view of the goods. Not only was it uncomfortable to be hung upside down, but it was humiliating as well. Her arms were dangling in the air. &ldquo;Uhhh...no...p-p-please...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua wanted to have fun with her body while in this position. He folded her legs by stretching them to the side. Using this motion, he made her legs open and close over and over.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was helpless like a puppet and all she could do was moan and groan. &ldquo;Ahhh! Ahhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua enjoyed toying with her like this, since her body was lightweight. He kept opening and closing her legs, stretching them to its limits. She felt as if her legs would snap off at any moment. &ldquo;Aaaah! Aaaah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Then he raised her legs up a little bit, and he licked her leg. Faith moaned in disgust. He licked her other leg all over.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hold her still.&rdquo; said Teal. He pointed his index finger and shot a small laser at her back. *Zap* She groaned in pain. He kept shooting lasers at the upside down woman&rsquo;s naked body. He was firing randomly, and some of them hit her butt, and most of them hit her back.</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua then threw her on the ground. *Thud*</p></p>

<p><p>By now, Faith could barely move a muscle. Her naked body was filled with bruises and dirt, and she was aching all over. She tried to crawl away...</p></p>

<p><p>The assassins snickered at her, seeing how slow she is. To them, the image of a naked woman trying to crawl away is amusing.</p></p>

<p><p>Navy got up from his seat. He walked over to the fallen woman and opened his palm and shot a wave of electricity at her. Zzzzzzt! The pain was excruciating, and she screamed at the top of her lungs. &ldquo;AAAAH!&rdquo; Her eyes grew wide open. This torture makes everything before that seem like child&rsquo;s play. She was no longer feeling pain in just one body part, but pain in her entire body at once. All her limbs and her torso were paralyzed from the shock.</p></p>

<p><p>Her hand reached forward, desperately trying to grab the air. The forest is close by, just beyond the crater and the grass fields. For some reason, she thought she could grab forest that&rsquo;s directly in front of her, and if she could do that, then she can escape.</p></p>

<p><p>But despite her wishes, there was no escape from this horrific situation. After being electrocuted, she barely had any strength to move.</p></p>

<p><p>Navy zapped her again, while the others laughed. The physical pain was so intense, it&rsquo;s as if she&rsquo;s grieving 1000 years worth of pain all at once. &ldquo;AAAAAAH!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tears of pain and despair streamed down her eyes. She was naked and at their complete mercy. Her life means nothing to them, her body is just their plaything.</p></p>

<p><p>The pain was too much to bear, and she could not even move a muscle as she laid there. The villains&rsquo; laughter became distorted, they grew louder and louder every second. All she could feel right now is her face on the dirt, and the tears streaming down her face.</p></p>

<p><p>All Faith could see is the dirt in front of her. She was completely exposed to these villains, but being naked is the least of her problems now. She wonders if she can survive this and live to see the next day.</p></p>

<p><p>In this unforgiving situation, Faith was completely helpless, a sitting duck waiting to be fried. The tears streamed down her face like a river, it&rsquo;s as if her eyes were made of water. Her vision was blocked by her tears, and everything looks distorted.</p></p>

<p><p>With the last of her strength, she murmured: &ldquo;Help me&#8230;&rdquo; But she was too weak to say it out loud. It came out as a whisper that cannot be heard. At this point, she could only pray for help. (Somebody please help me! Tyson&#8230; help&#8230; Nebula&#8230; Zelfire&#8230; Macintosh&#8230; anybody?!)</p></p>

<p><p>Unable to face reality, she continued to pray for some kind of escape. But the cruel reality is, no one is there to save her. She is all alone, left to fend for herself against these three violent men.</p></p>

<p><p>Her suffering is their bliss. Aqua and Teal were entertained by Navy&rsquo;s torture session, treating it like some kind of TV show. These assassins place little value on human life, and hers is no different. Despite all the punishment, her body was still in one piece, although it might not be for long. Her skin had bruises and lashes.</p></p>

<p><p>Navy opened his palm and zapped her again, and she let out groans and screams like never before. This crater has become a living hell for her, and it might even be her grave. Her screams echoed throughout the forest.</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="d">[ D ] - Fight the Invisible Enemy </span></p></center>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tyson, this time the enemy is too powerful. Even if you&rsquo;re a super sayan, you can&rsquo;t even handle one of them - how do you fight someone you can&rsquo;t see?&rdquo; asked Macintosh.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure. I will have to find a way.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;One more thing&#8230;earlier today I sensed Zelfire&rsquo;s ki fading.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Zelfire&#8230;do you think he was attacked too?&rdquo; Tyson asked. <br>  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very likely. They&rsquo;ve attached both me and Nebula. It&rsquo;s as if they&rsquo;re attacking everyone close to you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Tyson realized something important. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Macintosh. And they&rsquo;re targeting everyone I know&#8230;their next target is Faith!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s still at home.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of Nebula.&rdquo; said Mac. &ldquo;Go find her.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson went over to the window, about to jump out. &ldquo;Thanks pal, I&rsquo;ll leave it up to you.&rdquo; With that said, he flew off.</p></p>

<p><p>Froooom! Tyson flew back to the forest at top speed, worried about the woman he loves. (Faith, please be okay!)</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;AS1_Dark_Room_1&quot;></a>The Dark Room - 1</p></p>

<p><p>The metallic doors to the dark room opened. Aqua and Teal dragged Faith into the room, as Navy walked behind them. Faith was wearing nothing but a pink towel, semi-conscious as they drag her by the arms. There was a chair in front of the huge computer screen, and a man was sitting there.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Commander Blue.&rdquo; greeted Navy.</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua and Teal let Faith go, allowing her to fall on her knees. Her left hand was on the floor, while her right hand was pressing the towel against her chest, clinging onto it tightly.</p></p>

<p><p>The chair turned around and Blue faced them. &ldquo;Oh. Is that Tyson Spade&rsquo;s woman?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She looked up to see who was speaking, but the darkness of the room covered the man&rsquo;s face. Like his subordinates, he was dressed in black, so his body features were not seen from this angle. But even without a face, Faith could tell there was something evil and ominous about this man&#8230;one with dark ambitions and impure intentions&#8230;one who will do anything for his own greed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes sir.&rdquo; Navy replied. &ldquo;We did not kill her, we brought her here just as you ordered.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Excellent.&rdquo; Blue said, folding his hands. &ldquo;You still have a target to kill. Now go and eliminate that sayan pest.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Navy bowed. The three assassins walked out of the room, and the metallic doors closed behind them.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue&rsquo;s mobile chair glided slowly towards Faith, and she saw his face for the first time. He was a moderately good looking young man with bright blue eyes. But his eyes betrayed him. His eyes were that of a sinister, ruthless killer, one who would stop at nothing to achieve his goals&#8230;one who places no value on human life&#8230;and one who treats women like sex objects.</p></p>

<p><p>Like his squad members, he wore a black suit that covers his whole body, with the exception of his hands and his head.</p></p>

<p><p>He did not even bother to stand up to walk over to her. Sitting down on his chair makes him feel powerful and in control. It sets him up as the position of authority, he who is sitting down is in charge, and she his slave, because she is the one kneeling on the floor.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith gasped as he approached her, inch by inch. Her body trembled in fear, her hand held the towel close to her chest. Her eyes were shaking.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith finds herself from one compromising situation to the next. And now, she finds herself kneeling on the floor, practically naked in front of this villain. Blue smiled wickedly, and there was lust in his eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue grabbed her chin, making her face him. Her eyes were shaking from fear and she could feel his breath. &ldquo;Hmmm. So you&rsquo;re Tyson&rsquo;s woman, huh?&rdquo; He closed his eyes and kissed her lips. Tears dripped down her eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>When he was done with her, he grabbed her by the neck with one hand, and she choked. He shoved her on the floor. *Thud*</p></p>

<p><p>While behind her, Blue grabbed Faith by the hair, while she winced in pain. &ldquo;Uuhhh&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>His face was next to hers. &ldquo;Tyson sure has good taste in women. And now I&rsquo;m going to have a taste too.&rdquo; Blue whispered into her ear. He then shoved her on the floor. *Thud* Faith laid sideways, her face in her arms.</p></p>

<p><p>She turned around and sat up. Blue&rsquo;s chair moved forward, and she crawled backwards.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No. No, please!&rdquo; she cried out, crawling away for her dear life.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue became more turned on while watching her desperate attempts to flee. Her towel was really short, and most of her legs were revealed. And he wanted to see what&rsquo;s between those beautiful legs of hers. And it all takes is one pull to remove that towel from her body.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue took out a small laser gun and fired at the area between her legs. *Zap* It hit the floor and nearly destroyed her womanhood. Faith gasped and desperately crawled backwards. Blue continued to inch his way to her, and fired another small laser at the same area. *Zap* He continued to fire lasers, aiming between her legs. He was enjoying this very much.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s back hit the wall, and Blue stood there, laughing. &ldquo;Heh heh heh.&rdquo; He grew excited, thinking of doing all kinds of things to her body. Faith did not want to stick around to find out what those things were. She stood up, using the wall as her pillar.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make you my woman.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Blue and his chair inched his way towards her, and she ran past him to the other side of the dark room. Blue pressed the rotate on his chair and it turned 360 degrees towards her direction. Even though the chair&rsquo;s movements are slow, he was not worried at all, because she&rsquo;s already trapped in a cage.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith noticed there&rsquo;s a red button to her side, as well as a metallic door. She hit the red button with her fist, and the door opened and she went, and the doors shut behind her. She backed away to the opposite wall, her hand clenching the towel.</p></p>

<p><p>This room, in contrast to the other, was lit up. There is a computer screen with a control panel on the side. It must have been used as a surveillance room for the spaceship. But it was considerably small, and there is only one door in and out. Meaning, Faith has just trapped herself in here.</p></p>

<p><p>She was trembling as she leaned against the wall, knowing that at any moment, those doors will open, and that man will come in. Even though only seconds have passed, the dreadfulness made it feel like an eternity. Faith realized that all chances of escape are gone, and only a horrible fate awaits her.</p></p>

<p><p>The doors finally opened, and Blue, came in, still sitting in his mobile chair. As he inched his way in, the door shut behind him. She was stuck against the wall, one hand pressed against the wall and one hand clinging onto her towel. The chair moved slowly towards her, and every second of wait was dreadful. Her pupils dilated, her heart was beating rapidly.</p></p>

<p><p>One can&rsquo;t blame the poor girl for feeling this way... she has no where to run and no where to hide... and she&rsquo;s practically naked, this towel clinging onto her diminutive frame. And now, she is about to be bullied again.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...No...!! Please, no!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Now he was so close their knees were almost touching. Suddenly, the armrest opened and a punching glove popped out and hit her in the stomach. *Thud*</p></p>

<p><p>The pain knocked the wind out of her. She was surprised by the method he used, but then again, he is a man who uses underhanded methods. Faith&rsquo;s pupils dilated and her mouth was wide open from the pain. She was already weak to begin with, and this hit made it worse.</p></p>

<p><p>No longer able to stand up, she fell on top of Blue. There was not much of a choice, the wall was behind her, and she could only fall forward. Faith&rsquo;s head was next to his, and she laid on top of him, as if they were embracing. Blue smiled, as everything is going the way he wants to.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, he grabbed her by the shoulders and turned her over, so that she&rsquo;s resting on the armrest, and his face is on top of hers. Her eyes were shaking in fear as they stared at each other. &ldquo;I told you I&rsquo;ll make you my woman.&rdquo; He forced his lips on her and enjoyed it to the fullest. Blue did not hold back even one bit as he tasted her lips aggressively.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was too weak and paralyzed to move. &ldquo;Mmmmffff!!&rdquo; Tears drip down her eyes. There is no longer anything she can do to defend herself or escape...this is the worst position to be in...as she lay there on the chair, helpless as Blue did whatever he wanted.</p></p>

<p><p>On his way home, Tyson saw a big crater, and stopped flying. &ldquo;Something must&rsquo;ve happened here. A big battle.&rdquo; Then he focused his 6<sup>th</sup> sense. &ldquo;Faith is no where to be found. Where is she?&rdquo; With each passing second, Tyson grew more scared. The last time he saw Faith was at home, and that&rsquo;s where she should be. Yet her ki has disappeared.</p></p>

<p><p>Without hesitating, Tyson flew in the direction of his home. Navy, upon detecting him, flew close to his target, completely under the radar. As Tyson was zooming through the forest, he sensed something and stopped. *Froom*</p></p>

<p><p>His eyes darted left and right, but saw no one. Suddenly, something hit him, knocking him to the ground. *Bam*</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; Tyson stood up. (Who did that? There&rsquo;s no one to be seen! This must be the invisible enemy Macintosh and Nebula warned me about.)</p></p>

<p><p>Navy, Teal, and Aqua appeared, surrounding Tyson on three sides. They were invisible, and ready to claim their prize. Usually, their targets are bewildered, not being able to see what hit them. And they get scared and frantic, which of course, is the best part for them. Because of their special abilities to hide from the naked eye, they kill their targets with ease. To them, this is just a walk in the park.</p></p>

<p><p>The three assassins ran towards their victim, ready to strike. They were going to hit him at the same time, to see who&rsquo;d kill him first. Tyson crossed his arms over his face and powered up. *Zzzzzzt* The energy waves generated from his body caused the pebbles around him to float up. His hair turned into a golden color, much brighter than the brightness of the sun. And a golden aura surrounded his body. His shield knocked the assassins away, which totally surprised them.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What is up with this guy!?&rdquo; Aqua blurted out.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a second stage sayan&#8230;a super sayan!&rdquo; He checked Tyson&rsquo;s power level. &ldquo;Astounding! Hmmm, now it all makes sense. That&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s such a huge bounty on his head.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;AS1_White_Room_1&quot;></a>The White Room - 1</p></p>

<p><p> In the control room, Blue was sitting on his designated mobile chair, carrying Faith horizontally in his arms. She was still wearing nothing but a pink towel and she was unconscious. Her eyes were twitching and her lips were quivering in pain. To be able to carry such a weak, fragile woman in his arms makes him feel strong and powerful. As the commander of the Assassin Squad, he gives orders to his subordinates and they must obey his words. Blue has lived his whole life seeking power, dominating others...and now that he gets to torture a naked woman, he is going to enjoy it to the fullest.</p></p>

<p><p>When he grew tired of holding Faith, he dropped her on the floor. *Thud* Faith groaned a little from the collision, but she barely moved a muscle. Slowly but surely, she came into consciousness and her eyes opened. Her entire body was aching from the torture earlier, and she had virtually no strength left. She panted for breath as she lifted her chin off the floor by leaning on her elbows. For someone in her condition, even doing such a small motion was painful and required a lot of focus. But she still had to get away from this place...no matter what.</p></p>

<p><p>Even though she was in dire pain, she tried to crawl away from Blue&rsquo;s chair. Her left arm reached forward to drag her body up a little bit, followed by her right arm. Her legs could move a little bit so they dragged against the concrete. In front of her was the control panel. It was close by, yet it felt so far away. Faith was grunting and panting for breath the whole time. Every move she made was difficult.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue sat there and watched in amusement as she crawled as slow as a snail. He did not know exactly why such a display was amusing. Maybe it&rsquo;s because she was struggling in futility despite her injuries. He wonders if she will make it without passing out.</p></p>

<p><p>He enjoyed hearing the groaning noises she was making. Hearing a woman moan and squeal turns him on. He shot her just to hear to moan some more. He could care less about his victim&rsquo;s wellbeing...she was badly injured to begin with...but that doesn&rsquo;t mean a thing to him.</p></p>

<p><p>She was already halfway to the control desk. Blue pointed his index finger forward and shot a small laser at her back, the part of her back that&rsquo;s exposed. Faith groaned and fell on her face. &ldquo;Ughhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He kept the dosage as small as possible as to not kill her or injure her too much, but it was enough to hurt her.</p></p>

<p><p>Despite that, she did not give up. Faith lifted her arms against the floor. Her arms were shaking as well as her entire upper body. Blue was enjoying this a lot. He shot another laser at her left hamstring. *Zap* Faith groaned and her whole body reacted to the shock. &ldquo;Uuugh!&rdquo; Blue fired another laser at her right hamstring. &ldquo;Uuugh!&rdquo; The poor girl was not prepared to be treated so roughly.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue finally got up from his chair. He was ready to take this to the next level.</p></p>

<p><p>Despite the pain inflicted on her skin, Faith continued to crawl like a snail, desperately reaching for the control desk. She groaned and moaned through each and every second. Eventually her hand reached the desk and grabbed onto it. Both her hands grabbed the edge of the desk and she got on her knees. Even trying to stand up was difficult, she was moaning and gasping for breath through each step. Finally, she managed to stand on her feet, although leaning on the desk bent over.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue shot another laser at her back. *Zap* &ldquo;Aaaagh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Seconds later, she regained her composure and turned around to face him. Her hands held the towel against her breasts.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue liked this look too. Her eyes were shaking from fear. &ldquo;No...please...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He shot a laser at her left leg. &ldquo;Uugh!&rdquo; Then one to her left leg. &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith winced from the pain.</p></p>

<p><p>His index finger still pointing forward, he raised his hand up slightly. He shot her shoulder. &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He shot her left hand and it fell to the side. Then he shot her right hand. It fell to the side as well. The towel was loose, and with nothing holding the towel in place, it slipped off her breasts and fell to the floor. *Plop*</p></p>

<p><p>That was the one thing Faith did not want to happen...Now she stood butt naked before this villain. This was the worst case scenario and her worst nightmare. Blue&rsquo;s eyes did not blink even once as he stared at her naked form. Blue inched his way towards her and she stood there like a deer in headlights, unable to move her any of her limbs. Her eyes were shaking and her lips parted from pure fear. She couldn&rsquo;t move a muscle due to the fear or maybe her arms being hit by the lasers...but whichever it is doesn&rsquo;t matter...what matters is what&rsquo;s about to happen to her. She remained like a frozen statue, staring in disbelief...her towel has dropped and she&rsquo;s standing before this villain completely naked.</p></p>

<p><p>The only man who should see her naked is the man she loves...Tyson...but he&rsquo;s not here...he has not been here the whole time she was suffering...and he may never show up. The only reality is the one that&rsquo;s in front of her...and what this man was about to do to her.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue grabbed her arms and she gasped. It was the moment she dreaded all this time... the moment she wished will never happen...He then leaned in and kissed her lips. &ldquo;Mmmmmfffff!&rdquo; Her eyes widened and tears drip down from the corner of her eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>Not only was her body exposed to him, but now he&rsquo;s violating her lips as well. The poor girl could offer no resistance as her lips were being violated and his hands squeezed her arms tightly. So this what completely dominated feels like...it was the worst feeling in the world for Faith.</p></p>

<p><p>As he swallowed her lips, his body leaned forward, forcing her to lean back until they were on top of the computer panel. The computer panel was slightly diagonal, so their bodies lay down at an angle, which made Blue enjoy it more. But for Faith, it felt terrible to have her naked body trapped between the panel and this man&rsquo;s body. Her bare back lay against the big buttons and they felt uncomfortable.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue violated her front and let himself loose. This time, it is truly the end of the line for Faith. She doesn&rsquo;t even have a towel anymore, she is completely naked, and in a compromising position from which there is no escape. Blue is going to have his way with her right here and now, and all she could do was scream and moan.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh!! Aaaah!! Ughhh!!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Even as a super sayan, Tyson can&rsquo;t fight what he can&rsquo;t see. The three assassins were circling him at sonic speed, blowing all the leaves away. Unable to see the enemy, he&rsquo;s just a sitting duck. As he glanced at the dirt, he saw their footsteps, and suddenly he got an idea. Tyson put his palm forward and fired a shockwave. Froom. The dirt from the ground hit Navy&rsquo;s chest.</p></p>

<p><p>Now that Navy has dirt on him, Tyson can see him. He charged at Navy and punched him against a tree. *Wham* After being hit, Navy&rsquo;s body became visible.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now I can see you.&rdquo; Tyson drew his fist back and ran at Navy.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Aqua and Teal got in front of Tyson and struck him in the chest. *Thud* As Tyson was being thrown backwards, Aqua and Teal kept on hitting him, causing his speed to increase, until he crashed into a tree. *Crash!* His speed was so great that the tree snapped, and Tyson went through it like it was nothing, and he slammed into another tree, which finally stopped him.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson stood up, his back aching from the hit. As long as he is surrounded by trees, his enemy has the advantage, so he took it to the air. *Froom*</p></p>

<p><p>Once again, he focused his 6<sup>th</sup> sense to locate their ki. But he found nothing. Growing impatient, he charged up his energy. &ldquo;Hyaaaaah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He released it all at once, firing beams in multiple directions from his body. The golden beams looked like a meteor shower. They hit the trees below, destroying them. *Bam bam bam*</p></p>

<p><p>Still invisible, Navy and Teal dodged the beams. &ldquo;What is he doing?&rdquo; asked Teal.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s wasting his energy, if you ask me.&rdquo; Navy replied.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He thinks that if he throws enough beams he might get lucky and hit us.&rdquo; Aqua suggested.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s powerful, but not that bright.&rdquo; Navy said.</p></p>

<p><p>Unable to keep it up, Tyson stopped the beams to take a breather. Releasing that much energy puts a lot of strain on his body.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Navy revealed himself and fired a beam. Tyson blocked it single handedly. But another beam came out of nowhere and Tyson blocked that one too.</p></p>

<p><p>Teal appeared behind Tyson, and fired a beam. *Zap* This one hit his back, causing him to lose his focus. The three beams all hit him at once, zapping his energy and causing him great pain.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aaaaaah!&rdquo; Being hit from three directions is too much even for a super sayan to handle, and seconds later, he fell to the ground, while his clothes were smoking.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh&#8230;&rdquo; The hero stood up, limping his way forward.</p></p>

<p><p>The assassins landed on the ground, snickering and chuckling. They know that their target is weakening, and is only moments away from death. So they&rsquo;re going to play with him and make him suffer.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Where are you, huh?&rdquo; yelled Tyson. &ldquo;Come out you cowards.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Someone punched him in the face. *Pow* Tyson punched but only hit the air. All he could hear was the annoying laughter of these assassins. Tyson grunted.</p></p>

<p><p>*Pow* Someone just hit him in the face. Tyson crossed his arms over his face. Teal punched him, knocking Tyson on the ground, and scraping it. *Scrrrrrrr*</p></p>

<p><p>They all laughed at him as he tried to stand up on his feet. Tyson panted for breath, still feeling the pain on his chest and arms.</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;AS1_Dark_Room_3&quot;></a>The Dark Room - 3</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s back is against the desk, and she watched in horror as Blue approached her like a predator would its prey. Her pupils were dilated, her eyes shaking, her body trembling as if it is the end of the world.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue grabbed her arms and she gasped from the shock. Her grip on the towel was lost, and the towel slipped off her breasts and fell down to her feet. She was staring Blue directly in the eyes and frozen from shock. It took her a moment to realize that she&rsquo;s standing naked in front of him.</p></p>

<p><p>But she was given no time to process the shame. Blue leaned in and kissed her on the lips. Poor Faith could do nothing to resist as he violated her lips and his hand squeezed her arm tightly. As he swallowed her lips, his body leaned forward, forcing her to lean back until they were on top of the computer panel.</p></p>

<p><p>The computer panel was slightly diagonal, so their bodies lay down at an angle, which made Blue enjoy it more. But it was worse for Faith to lie there at such an angle, her naked body trapped between the panel and this man. Her bare back lay against the buttons and they felt uncomfortable.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue violated her front and let himself loose. This time, it is truly the end of the line for Faith. She doesn&rsquo;t even have a towel anymore, she is completely naked, and in a compromising position from which there is no escape. Blue is going to have his way with her right here and now, and all she could do was scream and moan.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh!! Aaaah!! Ughhh!!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was screaming as Blue violated her on the floor. He is turned on and completely wild, and held nothing back.</p></p>

<p><p>Her legs were trapped between his. Her right hand was locked down by the wrist by Blue&rsquo;s hand. And her left hand grabbed the desk, but to no avail. She squirmed and tossed and turned.</p></p>

<p><p>The cold hard floor was uncomfortable. Not to mention having a man on top of her and having his way with her.</p></p>

<p><p>Tears drip down her eyes. She&rsquo;s losing consciousness. The ceiling became blurry. Her vision became blurry.</p></p>

<p><p>She screamed and screamed but no one heard her cries.</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;AS1_DarkRoom4&quot;></a>The Dark Room 4</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s torture continues in the dark room, the room where she first ran into Blue.</p></p>

<p><p>She was bent over the computer panel, with Blue behind her, stroking her and grabbing her breasts. She was barely able conscious. Weak and helpless. Her eyes were closed. She screamed from the pain and agony.</p></p>

<p><p>Her hand accidentally hit a switch, causing the computer lights to flicker. It flickered non-stop. It would normally cause a seizure or at least a migraine, but those two did not notice it at all.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue was in heaven. He kept groping her breasts, not letting go even for one second, he stroked her from behind. She was sweating all over.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue became so turned on that his consciousness was being altered. His eyes started to glow, as if on drugs. His body became charged with electricity all over, and Faith was zapped. She screamed louder than before.</p></p>

<p><p>He was violating her rougher. He was no longer a man, but a beast with animal instincts.</p></p>

<p><p>Poor Faith was being violated and electrocuted at the same time.</p></p>

<p><p>Her arms were shaking and they lost strength. And she fell on top of the computer desk, with him on top of her.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue&rsquo;s eyes still glowed. He zapped her some more. Faith&rsquo;s hand reached for the computer screen. Blue&rsquo;s hand grabbed her wrist and zapped her.</p></p>

<p><p>The pain was too much. She was losing consciousness, maybe even her life.</p></p>

<p><p>The assassins jumped onto the tree branches. &ldquo;So, who gets to kill him?&rdquo; Aqua asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Last time Navy got to do it.&rdquo; said Teal. &ldquo;So this time it&rsquo;s my turn.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, it should be my turn.&rdquo; Aqua debated.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all fire our beams at him at the same time.&rdquo; said Navy. &ldquo;This way we all get to kill him. This is a special occasion&#8230;we don&rsquo;t get to kill sayans very often.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Agreed!&rdquo; Aqua replied.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I like it.&rdquo; said Teal.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, a spirit blast was heading their way, and they jumped away. The blast destroyed the trees. *Froom!*</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire ran at super speed, grabbed Tyson, and ran down the forest.</p></p>

<p><p>Navy shouted: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let them get away!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua and Teal chased after them on the ground, firing their beams. *Bam bam* The beams hit the ground, but none of them hit Zelfire, for he was out of their range.</p></p>

<p><p>Seeing a lake up ahead, Zelfire decided to jump into it, taking Tyson with him. *Splash*</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua and Teal flew to the air. &ldquo;Do you see them?&rdquo; Aqua inquired.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No. Let&rsquo;s just blow them out of the water.&rdquo; Teal suggested.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Good idea!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They both gathered energy and fired a beam towards the lake. It caused the water to rise up, making huge waves.</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire saw the beams in the water, and luckily he was not close to them. He grabbed Tyson and swam his way into a tunnel. He did his best while carrying an adult male. Soon he will run out of air, so he better hurry up.</p></p>

<p><p>At the end of the tunnel was another body of water, a lake that is connected to the previous lake.</p></p>

<p><p>Teal and Aqua continued to fire beams into the lake blindly. Teal checked his scouter device on his wrist. &ldquo;Their ki has disappeared.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo; Aqua exclaimed. &ldquo;They got away. How will we explain this to Commander Blue?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We simply finish the job.&rdquo; said Navy, just arriving to the scene. &ldquo;The one who saved Tyson&#8230;he looks vaguely familiar.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Familiar, how? You&rsquo;ve seen him before?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The first human we defeated when we came to this planet&#8230;that man looks like him.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Teal and Aqua gasped. &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s him. I knew we shouldn&rsquo;t have gone easy on him.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t be far from here.&rdquo; said Navy. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; He flew away.</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;AS1_Doctor_Appears&quot;></a>The Doctor Appears</p></p>

<p><p>The metallic doors opened, and a man dressed in a lab coat was greeted by Blue. &ldquo;Ah, doctor, come in.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Commander. Did you say you had a specimen for me?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s right there.&rdquo; Blue said, pointing to Faith, who was kneeling in the corner.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was exhausted from all the torture, and panting for breath. The towel was wrapped around her body, and she was holding onto it with a firm grip. That was the only thing she had to hold onto, and after all that the poor girl has been through, who can blame her?</p></p>

<p><p>Her right arm was grabbing the control panel, while her left hand was holding onto the towel over her chest. She was sweating all over &ndash; there was sweat on her thighs, her shoulders, her breasts, and her face.</p></p>

<p><p>The doctor became delighted. &ldquo;Oohhhh. What a fine specimen we have.&rdquo; As he approached her, Faith grew nervous.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Blue replied. &ldquo;A live human female.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I can do whatever I want with her?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I have no more use for her. You can do whatever you want. As long as she stays alive.&rdquo; Blue replied.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh don&rsquo;t worry. She will remain alive&#8230;mostly.&rdquo; As the doctor approached the fallen woman, he made a perverted grabbing gesture. &ldquo;Heh heh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith just stared at him like a deer in headlights, her eyes shaking, on the verge of tears, and her body trembling. &ldquo;No&#8230;no!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The doctor reached his hand over to her, about to grab her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No! No!!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="d">[ E ] - Beyond the 6th Sense. Am I Strong Enough? </span></p></center>


<p><p>Zelfire and Tyson came out of the water, and took a deep breath. They swim to land and rested, breathing as if they did not have oxygen for ten years. They were relieved, and at the same time, tired and drained from the chore of escaping certain death.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson woke up and the wet cloth fell off his head. He was shocked at first, not knowing where he was. He could still feel the danger, as if seconds ago he was fighting against the invisible fighters. But seconds later, his mind calmed down, and he realized that he&rsquo;s perfectly safe in Zelfire&rsquo;s house.</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire was holding a big piece of log, which is about to turn to firewood. As Tyson came out of the house, Zelfire greeted him. &ldquo;Oh Tyson. You&rsquo;re awake.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;They have her&#8230;Faith.&rdquo; he mumbled, a little depressed. &ldquo;And they beat me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zell put the log down. *Thud* &ldquo;Tyson.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I have to go find her.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Zell. &ldquo;Last time you barely escaped. Next time you could die.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>While agitated, Tyson&rsquo;s wound was hurting him. &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; He fell on one knee, but his stubbornness did not allow him to fall completely. He stood up again. &ldquo;What&rsquo;d you expect me to do? Stay here like a sitting duck?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in no condition to fight.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo; Tyson replied, and he started to walk away.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;If you go now, both you and Faith are going to get killed.&rdquo;<br>  Tyson stopped and froze for a moment, realizing the truth behind Zelfire&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;What do you expect me to do?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We need a strategy&#8230;these guys are unlike anything we&rsquo;ve seen before. We need to be prepared.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;They can turn invisible&#8230;and not only that, they can hide their ki. They wear these suits that have technology we&rsquo;ve never seen before. We can&rsquo;t use our eyes&#8230;so we have to use our other basic senses.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Our basic senses?&rdquo; Tyson repeated.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;All humans have five basic senses. If we can&rsquo;t use our eyes to find the enemy, we still have our sense of hearing, smell, taste, and touch. We need to especially rely on hearing and smell. Look, the enemy relies on these cowardly tactics to catch their opponents off guard. That means they are weak, and if you somehow force them into a situation where they have to fight fair, they will lose.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Alright. When does the training begin?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zell smiled. &ldquo;Now.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A fish jumped up from the water, enjoying its split second of freedom, and fell back into, causing a little splash in the process. Sitting cross-legged on different stones, Tyson and Zelfire were in a semi-meditative state. As Zelfire suggested, they were blindfolded, so they do not use their eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hear anything.&rdquo; said Tyson.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This process takes time.&rdquo; Zell replied. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re used to using your eyes, so you&rsquo;re not used to just using your ears.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t possibly pin point a single fish in the pond. That&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Not impossible. Just hard. You need to focus.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>So Tyson took his advice and focused on the sound of the fish swimming. It is difficult to do, since he can hear so many sounds at the same time. The sound of the wind, the water, the trees blowing, and everything else that makes a sound.</p></p>

<p><p>He kept thinking that it&rsquo;s too hard, but then he stopped those thoughts, and kept his mind clear. And when he did that, he started to hear things he&rsquo;s never heard before. Maybe this is what Zelfire was saying, to focus by clearing your mind.</p></p>

<p><p>*Splish splish* The sound of the fish swimming was audible, something before that was never audible to Tyson&rsquo;s ears. &ldquo;I can hear it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Good. Now concentrate. Don&rsquo;t get distracted by anything.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You got it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula, watching them from the bushes, showed much disinterest. All they do is sit there with a blindfold, which is stupid and a waste of time. He walked away with his hands in his pockets.</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;AS1_Exp_Shackles&quot;></a>The Experiment - Bound By Shackles</p></p>

<p><p>Inside the laboratory, Faith was backing away to the wall, still clinging onto her towel. The doctor approached her ever so slowly, like a predator would its prey.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she shrieked. &ldquo;Stay away!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Come here, my little kitten.&rdquo; he taunted, as he inched his way towards her.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was shaking her head. &ldquo;No&#8230;no!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The doctor grabbed her arms and they struggled. Faith groaned as she struggled to get free. &ldquo;Ugh! Uhhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She tried to push him away, and shove him in the chest. She turned around, and he still had a grip on her arms. Then he grabbed the towel and pulled it off, revealing her naked body.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith, realizing that she was completely naked, covered her privates with her hands. She was embarrassed, standing naked in front of this evil man.</p></p>

<p><p>The doctor&rsquo;s eyes widened as he saw her natural form. Faith backed away until she was at the mechanical bed.</p></p>

<p><p>He grabbed her by the shoulders, while Faith squirmed, turning her head away. Her arms pushed his chest. Suddenly, there was a loud *thud* sound and Faith felt the wind being knocked out of her. The doctor punched her in the stomach, and the pain was too much to bear.</p></p>

<p><p>Her knees grew weak, and she fell against him. The doctor then put his arms around her back, holding her up. He placed her on the experimental bed.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, these metal plates appeared around her wrists &ndash; effectively trapping her. Metal plates appeared around her ankles as well, and a plate appeared over her breasts, and one over her waist.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please, no! No!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Now that she&rsquo;s completely chained up, Faith has no means of escape whatsoever &ndash; and she is completely helpless. The doctor leaned in close to her face, and she turned her head away.</p></p>

<p><p>The doc put on his face mask. &ldquo;Now my dear, the fun begins now&#8230;it won&rsquo;t hurt&#8230;not at first. Hehehehehe.&rdquo; His maniacal laughter echoed throughout the empty lab.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith thrashed about, but to no avail. Her arms and legs were chained up, so no matter how much she tried, she could do nothing against the cold metal on her bare skin. Not only that, but she was naked, her bare skin exposed to this freak of a doctor.</p></p>

<p><p>The doc grabbed a needle from the table and showed it to her. He squeezed the bottom of it and squirted out a liquid of some sort.</p></p>

<p><p>Upon seeing the needle, she had no idea what was in it, but she knew it&rsquo;s not good. She thrashed about, her head turning left and right. &ldquo;No! Doctor, please! No! No!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Poor Faith could only watch in horror as the madman approached with his deadly needle. He finally finds a human from earth that he can experiment on &ndash; to his heart&rsquo;s content. And he is definitely going to make use of this specimen&#8230;</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire charged at Tyson full throttle and punched, Tyson dodged. *Whoosh whoosh* This is just like any normal training, except for the fact that they&rsquo;re both blindfolded. This is training with a twist: they are not allowed to use the sixth sense.</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire let out a fury of punches, all of which Tyson blocked. *Pow pow pow* But Zelfire broke through his defenses, and landed a punch to this face. *Wham* This knocked Tyson away, causing his feet to scrape the dirt.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You have to sense your opponent&rsquo;s life force.&rdquo; he instructed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too difficult. How can I find you without detecting your ki?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire leaped and kicked, Tyson dodged.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Other than their ki, all humans emit a certain energy from their bodies.&rdquo; Zelfire continued to punch him non-stop. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s their life force. Find their life force, and attack them with all you&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson remained still and tried to sense Zelfire&rsquo;s life force. It&rsquo;s difficult to pinpoint his location when he&rsquo;s running all over the place at super speed. Everything is pitch black, and he has nothing to rely on but his hearing. He could barely pinpoint Zell&rsquo;s footsteps.</p></p>

<p><p>But just as he could isolate the sound of fish swimming in the pool, he can isolate Zell&rsquo;s footsteps and tell exactly where he is. *Doosh doosh* The footsteps grew louder and louder, and Tyson can almost &ldquo;see&rdquo; Zelfire charging at him. Now that he knows where Zell is, Tyson drew back his fist and punched him. *Wham*</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire was thrown on the ground. As he stood up, he was actually happy. &ldquo;Congratulations Tyson.&rdquo; he said, removing his blindfold.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson removed it as well. &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t get so happy yet. This is only the beginning.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson nodded. They both put their blindfolds back on, and continued to spar. Ever since Tyson left his parents and lived on his own, he did not have any guidance from a parental figure. The only thing close to an uncle he has is Zelfire, who is Tyson&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s best friend. Mason Spade and Zelfire went on many journeys together, they went through thick and thin.</p></p>

<p><p>So, being his father&rsquo;s age, Zelfire has a lot of wisdom, and oftentimes, Tyson goes to him for advice. Although their relationship is never officially declared, it is clear that Tyson sees him, and looks up to him as an uncle.</p></p>

<p><p>Meanwhile, Nebula was doing some training of his own. While blindfolded, he took his sword and slashed some trees. A bunch of them were cut down with a few strokes. He took off his blindfold. &ldquo;How stupid.&rdquo; he muttered to himself. Obviously, he was still angry about his defeat at the hands of Teal and Aqua. Even if it wasn&rsquo;t a fair fight, he still has a warrior&rsquo;s pride, which is badly damaged. And the only way to restore one&rsquo;s pride is to get revenge.</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;AS1_Exp_Needle&quot;></a>The Experiment - The Needle</p></p>

<p><p>Meanwhile, Faith was still being tortured by the mad scientist. Her screams were loud enough to travel outside the lab, but they fell on deaf ears. Inside Blue&rsquo;s ship, an entire section was dedicated to the doc&rsquo;s laboratory. In this room, he can do whatever he wants without supervision...in other words, he can get away with anything.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith found herself in the worst and most compromising position yet - chained to the metallic platform. Not only was she naked, but she had no means to escape whatsoever. She&rsquo;s nothing more than a sitting duck, waiting to be slaughtered.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please...no more...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The doc, wearing his face mask, looked more evil than ever. He put his face close to hers. She turned her head away. He grabbed her chin and made her look at him. &ldquo;What a fine specimen you are. I couldn&rsquo;t have asked for a better one.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He took out a needle from his pocket and pointed it at her thigh.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do this, please!&rdquo; she cried out.</p></p>

<p><p>He inserted the needle into her thigh, and she moaned in pain. &ldquo;Uhhh!&rdquo; The cold, hard needle pierced her bare skin, and went into her bloodstream. She has no idea what he injected into her. In fact, she has no idea why she&rsquo;s being treated this way. The poor girl feared for her life every single second, not knowing if the mad scientist is going to kill her.</p></p>

<p><p>But little did Faith know, dying may actually be easier compared to the torture she&rsquo;s about to receive.</p></p>

<p><p>The doc tightened his gloves. He put his hands on her thighs and felt them up. &ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s check your reproductive organs.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith gasped. &ldquo;No...no...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The doc moved his hands along her leg, all the way up into the area under the metal cuffs. She screamed and groaned in pain. Tears drip down her eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>The doc enjoyed himself as he fumbled around that area, feeling it with his fingers. But whatever joy he felt, Faith felt ten times the pain. Her head thrashed about left and right, her limbs thrashed against the metal cuffs.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith grew up as a princess, sheltered and spoiled. She was taught that a woman&rsquo;s private body parts are sacred, and the area between her legs should never be touched by any man. That area should only be seen or touched by one man, the one who is her husband.</p></p>

<p><p>But for the mad doctor, Faith&rsquo;s body is not sacred, nothing is off limits. Her body is nothing more than an experiment, she&rsquo;s just a lab rat that he can treat as he wishes. And her private spot is no different.</p></p>

<p><p>She continued to squirm and thrash about in discomfort, moaning as he shoved his fingers down there. &ldquo;Ughhh! Aaaah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>*Splllash* Tyson could feel the cold water hit his bare skin. He was sitting down next to Zelfire, in a meditating position. Both of them were topless, and they just sat there for hours under the waterfall, letting the water hit them constantly. Aside from sparring, this is their other training &ndash; according to Zelfire &ndash; this is the training of the mind.</p></p>

<p><p>Being part of his usual routine, Zelfire, of course, is used to this. Tyson, however, finds it extremely uncomfortable. His eyes twitched as he tried to remain still, as the water hit his head and splashed down his shoulders and chest. One hour of this is too much, let alone four hours.</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;AS1_Exp_High_Voltage&quot;></a>The Experiment - High Voltage</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, please!&rdquo; screamed Faith, as she was being tortured by the doctor. He held a needle in front of her, and squeezed a little, and a few drops of liquid came out.</p></p>

<p><p>He was wearing a mask and glasses. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what happens when I insert this into your system. Heh heh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she yelled, her head thrashing left and right.</p></p>

<p><p>The doctor stabbed the needle into her neck and she winced in pain.</p></p>

<p><p>Then he went over to where the lever was. &ldquo;Now&#8230;let&rsquo;s see how much pain the human body can handle.&rdquo; The lever controlled the voltage of the metallic bed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to get a little rough.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He pulled it to level one. The electricity began to flow into the machine. Faith screamed as her body was being zapped. &ldquo;Aaahhhhhh!!&rdquo; She felt the pain from head to toe, and it was too much for her to handle. But it&rsquo;s only the beginning.</p></p>

<p><p>The doctor pulled the lever further down, increasing the voltage. The shock became greater, and so is the pain. Faith thrashed about as she screamed in agony. &ldquo;AAAAAAAH!!&rdquo; Her head turned left and right, her limbs thrashed about. Her wrists were cuffed by metallic bands, and she could not do anything to retaliate. She was no different than a sitting duck, waiting to be cooked.</p></p>

<p><p>Poor Faith was completely and utterly helpless in this situation. Her arms and legs were chained up, and she must bear this agonizing pain, with the electricity surging through her body. It felt as if the electricity was attacking her organs and bloodstream, eating it from the inside out.</p></p>

<p><p>But of course, her suffering meant nothing to the doctor. She&rsquo;s just a lab rat for his sick experiments. He wanted to test the limits of the human body, and he found the perfect specimen. But he&rsquo;s not just an ordinary scientist, on his planet he is known for his cruelty. Most people that he experimented on did not survive, and if they did, they&rsquo;re not the same mentally.</p></p>

<p><p>The doctor pushed the lever back up, ending the shocks. She breathed hard. &ldquo;Stop...p-please...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The doctor pulled down the lever even further, increasing the voltage one more time.</p></p>

<p><p>Poor Faith can&rsquo;t catch a break. She was cuffed to the table and cannot move at all. Her fingers curled into fists. This pain was unlike any other she&rsquo;s ever faced up to now. She has been through life and death several times...and this is the first time she wished she did not survive. The pain was too much to handle. Even though she was falling unconscious, the voltage kept her awake.</p></p>

<p><p>She screamed like she never screamed before. Her fingers lost their strength and her fist opened up.</p></p>

<p><p>Every second felt like 10 years, and every sensation of pain felt like it was magnified a thousand times. The doctor did not care about her feelings at all. He&rsquo;s a scientist, so he&rsquo;s indifferent to his subject&rsquo;s suffering. If she survives, good. If not, then too bad. Her screams were music to his ears.</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="f">[ F ] - 3 on 3 Showdown</span></p></center> 

<p><p>Navy and the others have been searching for Spade for the past few days, and he was growing impatient. While in the sky, he checked his scouter. It beeped and he smiled. &ldquo;Gentlemen. We&rsquo;ve found them at last.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson and Zelfire were standing in the forest. &ldquo;Do you feel that, Tyson?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Three large ki&rsquo;s are gathered in one area, and they are heading this way.&rdquo; Seconds later, the ki&rsquo;s disappeared.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;There is no doubt about it, it&rsquo;s them.&rdquo; said Zelfire. &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s true that there&rsquo;s a price on your head. A huge one.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Jerrell said there&rsquo;s a bounty on my head.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Do you have any idea who&rsquo;d want you dead this badly?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson looked at him. &ldquo;I have a lot of enemies.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;True. Sayans aren&rsquo;t exactly popular in this galaxy.&rdquo; Then Zelfire saw a shining star in the sky. &ldquo;Who could that be?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s gotta be Nebula.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula arrived and landed in front of them. &ldquo;Sup guys.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What brings you here?&rdquo; Tyson asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s three of them. Just thought I&rsquo;d even the odds.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This time the numbers are even.&rdquo; said Zelfire. &ldquo;They were able to beat us because they attacked us when we were alone. And they outnumbered us. This time it&rsquo;s different.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Thus, the heroes waited for their adversaries to arrive. The assassins showed up in the sky and landed in front of the heroes. Of course, they were snickering with evil smiles on their faces.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well look what we have here.&rdquo; said Navy. &ldquo;More lamb for the slaughter.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua pointed at Tyson. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the only one we want. The rest of you should leave if you don&rsquo;t want to die.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula raised his fist. &ldquo;We still have a score to settle from earlier.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire: &ldquo;Did you really think you could attack us and get away with it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Teal: &ldquo;Hmph. I should&rsquo;ve finished you off earlier.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;Grrr. Let&rsquo;s see if you can back up those words.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Navy: &ldquo;Playtime is over, kids.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The assassins turned invisible one by one. The heroes blur out of sight, and in an instant, no one was standing on the ground anymore.</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire was in the air, getting hit in the face by Navy. *Pow pow* He blocked by crossing his arms over his face, and Navy continued to punch him, not letting up. *Pow*</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula was a sitting duck as Teal was hitting him from all directions. He blocked to the best of his abilities, but he was barely able to keep up with Teal&rsquo;s movements. Sometimes he hits from the front, then from the side, and sometimes from the bottom. *Wham pow wham*</p></p>

<p><p>Teal flew circles around Nebula, hitting him at every opportunity. Suddenly, he hit Nebula from the back, knocking him into the ground. *Wham*</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson is also not having much luck. All his punches have missed, due to Aqua&rsquo;s slickness and agility. Aqua punched him in the face, knocking him into a tree. *Thud*</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh.&rdquo; laughed Aqua, becoming visible. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s a 10 million UU price on your head. You&rsquo;re not even that strong.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is only the beginning.&rdquo; Tyson turned super sayan.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So you show your full power at last, eh?&rdquo; Aqua turned invisible, and the fight continues.</p></p>

<p><p>After getting hit some more, Zelfire landed on the ground. His arms were hurting real bad, and he needed to do something fast. He looked at the lake and got an idea. He ran towards the lake, and Navy chased him, while shooting beams.</p></p>

<p><p>*Bam bam* The beams almost hit Zelfire, causing the ground to explode. Zelfire&rsquo;s quickness allowed to dodge all the beams. One of them was going for his feet, and he jumped over it. *Bam*</p></p>

<p><p>One of the beams hit Zell in the back, causing him to bite the dust. &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Navy landed. He looked at the lake. &ldquo;Heh. So you wanted to lead me to the lake so splash water on me. So you can render my invisibility useless.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire got up. &ldquo;Darn, you saw through my plan.&rdquo; he said, smiling. For someone who is as roughed up as he is, he still has an optimistic attitude.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m stupid?&rdquo; Navy opened his palm, about to fire something.</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire fired a beam at Navy&rsquo;s feet, blowing dirt on him. Navy covered his face. &ldquo;Why you!&rdquo; He jumped up and blurred out of site.</p></p>

<p><p>But he&rsquo;s not entirely invisible, for there&rsquo;s still dirt on his suit. Zelfire searched carefully with his eyes, and saw the dirt moving about in the trees. Now all he has to do is wait for his opponent to come to him.</p></p>

<p><p>Navy, not knowing he has lost the advantage, prepared to strike. He flew towards Zelfire, getting ready to punch the daylights out of him. Suddenly, Zelfire look up in his direction, which shocked Navy. Zell blocked his punch, and counterattacked with a punch to the chest. *Wham*</p></p>

<p><p>Navy hit the ground, and now it&rsquo;s his turn to bite the dust. He was angry, and his fingers grabbed the dirt and squeezed it. He stood up, more determined than ever to beat Zelfire up.</p></p>

<p><p>He blurred out of sight, and appeared to the side. He punched, Zelfire ducked, and uppercut him in the chin. *Thud*</p></p>

<p><p>Navy fell down even harder this time. &ldquo;How can this be&#8230;how can he see where I&rsquo;m coming from?&rdquo; Then he looked down, and saw the dirt on his suit. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s how! So you think you&rsquo;re smart, do you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire was running towards him from a distance. Navy was angry and he gritted his teeth. He powered up, blowing the dirt off his body, and turned invisible.</p></p>

<p><p>He opened his palm, ready to fire something, but Zelfire blurred out of sight.</p></p>

<p><p>Navy was surprised, and he looked everywhere for Zelfire. Where did he go? Near the ground? Nope. In the sky? Nope. Navy looked left and right, up and down, and saw no sign of Zell, and he panicked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; said Zelfire&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t fight what you can&rsquo;t see? How&rsquo;s it feel to have a taste of your own medicine?&rdquo;<br>  &ldquo;That makes two of us. How will you fight me if you can&rsquo;t see me? The worst this can be is a stalemate.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I wonder.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire&rsquo;s attitude angered Navy even more. This is a new situation for him, considering he always has the upper hand. But this is the first time Navy is unable to find his target, which one can obviously tell from the expression on his face.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You fool. Even if I can&rsquo;t see you, I can still find you with this.&rdquo; Navy checked his scouter for Zelfire&rsquo;s energy signal. Once it beeped, it confirmed Zelfire&rsquo;s location. &ldquo;Aha, there you are.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He flew past a few trees and saw Zelfire standing there, searching for the enemy. Navy smirked, now that the situation is in his favor. He can now deal the winning blow, while his enemy won&rsquo;t even know what hit him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Say goodbye!&rdquo; said Navy, gathering energy into his palm.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Goodbye!&rdquo; Zelfire shouted, suddenly turning around. Navy was surprised.</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire fired the Spirit Blast at him, which completely obliterated his body. *Kaboom* Navy did not stand a chance against that kind of energy.</p></p>

<p><p>Once the fight is over, Zelfire jumped to the ground to take a breather. &ldquo;He was a tough opponent. But I was able to outsmart him.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, a beam hit him from behind, burning his back and tossing him on the ground. Zelfire now laid on the ground, unconscious, or maybe even dead. His shirt had a hole on it from the burn, and his clothes and skin were still smoking.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue turned visible. &ldquo;What a careless fool. I&rsquo;ve been behind you this whole time.&rdquo; Then he turned invisible again, and stepped back into the forest.</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;AS1_Exp_Drill&quot;></a>The Experiment - The Drill</p></p>

<p><p>In the laboratory of hell, Faith&rsquo;s torture session continues. The doctor was not even close to being done with her. But she&rsquo;s already at her limit.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please...no more...&rdquo; she whimpered. She has been cuffed to the metal bed the whole time, and begging was all she can do. &ldquo;Please...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The doctor pulled out a piece of duct tape and put it over her mouth.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mmmmfff!&rdquo; Faith turned her head left and right, with tear-filled eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>He chuckled a bit, now that she can&rsquo;t scream anymore. He put his hand on her stomach. &ldquo;Ohhh what a fine body you have.&rdquo; he said in a deranged way. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to dissect you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mmmff! Mmmmff!&rdquo; Those were the only sounds that came out of the tape.</p></p>

<p><p>The doc kept poking her belly button. Faith&rsquo;s discomfort was amusing to him.</p></p>

<p><p>He then grabbed her leg and felt it all over with his hands. Even if wearing gloves, he can feel her smooth skin. He&rsquo;s examining her as if she&rsquo;s an alien species. Then he starts licking her leg. Faith moaned in disgust. His sticky, wet tongue gliding on her shin, and moving up to her knee, and then her thigh.</p></p>

<p><p>Then the doc decided to get to business. He pushed some buttons on the control panel. The light from the ceiling started to move. It&rsquo;s not just a light after all. It turned into a machine with many sharp objects on it. One of them was a drill, and the others look like knives. And then it started rotating in place, and it descended towards Faith&rsquo;s head.</p></p>

<p><p>As this thing approached, Faith moaned like she&rsquo;s never moaned before. &ldquo;Mmmmf! Mmmmmf!!&rdquo; Her head tossed left and right, her limbs struggled in place. The closer it got to her, the more desperate she became, and the louder she screamed.</p></p>

<p><p>The mad scientist laughed. &ldquo;Hah ha ha ha ah ha ha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tears streams down her face as her head tossed and her limbs thrashed about. &ldquo;Mmmmmmm!!!&rdquo; The poor girl was too young to die in a place like this. Poor Faith had not thought about death until this point. It would be horrible to die in a hell hole like this, trapped in a dark laboratory, naked and chained down, and to be slaughtered like an animal. This situation was never fair to begin with. Nothing good has happened ever since she was brought into this spaceship.</p></p>

<p><p>But Faith wondered what if the doctor isn&rsquo;t going to kill her. What if he takes her apart piece by piece? That would be a fate worst than death. To live but as an experiment for the rest of her life.</p></p>

<p><p>And now the machine is mere inches away from her face. &ldquo;Mmmmmm!!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula couldn&rsquo;t defend himself against Teal&rsquo;s constant attacks. He was being punched left and right. *Pow pow* Each time Nebula threw a punch, he only hit the air. He grew tired of getting hit, so he fired beams in a circular fashion. *Bam bam bam* He thought that if he fired them in a full circle, eventually he will hit his target. But much to his dismay, he destroyed nothing but rocks and trees.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Damn it, show yourself, you coward!&rdquo; he shouted in frustration.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Teal punched Nebula in the chest, knocking him against a tree. *Wham*</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula was crouching, coughing from the pain. Teal was now in the air, gathering energy. Once he&rsquo;s done, he fired a beam downwards. Nebula looked up at the brightness, and saw the beam coming for him. It was too late for him to dodge. *Kaboom*</p></p>

<p><p>When the dust settled and the smoke cleared, Nebula was still in one piece, but not unharmed. His right hand was bleeding from a severe wound, and he put his hand over the wound to slow the bleeding down.</p></p>

<p><p>Things don&rsquo;t look good for our hero. With a bleeding arm, along with bruises all over his body, how can he possibly fight back against an invisible opponent?</p></p>

<p><p>But it is darkest before dawn&#8230;as he stared at his own blood, he came up with a plan.</p></p>

<p><p>Teal became visible, now that he senses Nebula is no longer a threat. He grabbed Nebula by the neck, and lifted him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you now. You&rsquo;re not so tough, earthling.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula grabbed his arm, letting his blood drip on Teal&rsquo;s arm. Teal then punched him in the stomach, knocking him against a tree. But Nebula is as stubborn as he is strong, and he still stood up on his feet.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmph. You still got some fight left in you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Naturally.&rdquo; he replied, wiping the blood off his chin. &ldquo;I still have to pay you back for last time.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tough words coming from someone with no power.&rdquo; Teal turned invisible. &ldquo;How will you defeat me when you can&rsquo;t see me? You can&rsquo;t even touch me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula, however, was not phased at all. &ldquo;This is the last time you can brag with that big mouth of yours.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Teal ran circles around Nebula at super speed, hoping to catch him off guard. Unbeknownst to him, Teal has a stain of blood on his suit, and as a result, Nebula knows exactly where he is.</p></p>

<p><p>Teal suddenly stopped, and charged forward to attack. Nebula punched him in the face. *Pow* His nose was bleeding. &ldquo;Ugh. But how&#8230;that was a stroke of luck.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s this for luck?&rdquo; Nebula gathered energy into his fist, and punched Teal in the stomach, knocking him away. *Frooom*</p></p>

<p><p>The assassin, now bruised up, was surprised at the turn of events. Nebula gathered all the energy he had left in his right palm, while his left hand held his right arm for support. The energy was a dark blue color, taking the shape of a blue ball with a ring around like, like Saturn. This is his finishing move, the Nebulon Blast.</p></p>

<p><p>Teal was panting for breath. &ldquo;How does he know where I am?&rdquo; He looked at his arm, and saw the blood stain on it, and his eyes grew wide open with shock. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it&#8230;that&rsquo;s your trick! Why you little&#8230;&rdquo; Suddenly, he saw a bright light ahead.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula fired the Nebulon Blast, and at this point, it was too late to dodge. Teal just stood there in shock, as he witnessed the final moments of his life. &ldquo;No&#8230;nooooo!&rdquo; The blue ball smashed into his body and went past him as if he was nothing but air. It traveled for a few miles, and caused a big explosion. *Kaboom!*</p></p>

<p><p>A big chunk of the forest was destroyed. Nebula turned around and began to walk away, holding onto his wound. He was injured, but at the end of the day, victory belonged to him, and that gave him the satisfaction he needed.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, he sensed something powerful, and turned around. A beam came out of nowhere and Nebula dodged it. Nebula returned the favor by firing a beam of his own.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue blocked the beam and revealed himself. &ldquo;Nice reflexes. You did a little better than your earthling friend.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You mean Zelfire?&rdquo;<br>  &ldquo;You earthlings should have taken our warnings seriously.&rdquo; Blue replied.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not an earthling.&rdquo; Nebula retorted.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. You&rsquo;re going to end up just like your friend.&rdquo; Black claws came out of Blue&rsquo;s backpack, and they grew in size until they hit the ground, and lifted Blue off his feet into the air. His backpack turned into a black sphere, the device that holds the claws.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What the hell?!&rdquo; exclaimed Nebula. He was bewildered; it&rsquo;s his first time seeing a weapon like this.</p></p>

<p><p>The claws were like that of a spider&rsquo;s, they can walk and attack with deadly accuracy. Blue controls the spider legs with earpiece, which is connected to his brain. With a single thought, he can control the legs&rsquo; movements.</p></p>

<p><p>The two front claws attacked Nebula, and he back flips away. He draws his sword and smashes the blade into the claw. *Clang* His blade broke in half, and he was shocked.</p></p>

<p><p>The claw hit him, knocking him against a tree. *Thud* Nebula was critically injured, and just sat there in awe. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Say goodnight!&rdquo; Blue fired a beam at him, Nebula had no time to dodge, and it exploded on him. *Kaboom*</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson was floating in the air, as the enemy hit him from all directions. Aqua&rsquo;s movements were unpredictable, sometimes he&rsquo;d attack from the front, sometimes from the back, and sometimes from below, so there&rsquo;s no way he can properly defend himself. *Wham* He was hit from the back. *Wham* He was hit in the face.</p></p>

<p><p>He became frustrated and formed a golden shield. Once Aqua touched the shield, he got zapped, and was repelled by it. &ldquo;You damn sayan. I&rsquo;ll get you yet.&rdquo; Aqua turned invisible again.</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua appeared from above and fired a beam at Tyson. The super sayan blocked it, but it pushed him down into the ground, and exploded. Tyson coughed from the smoke.</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua landed. &ldquo;You think you&rsquo;re so smart, eh? But you&rsquo;re still going to lose, big time!&rdquo; He ran at super fast speed, blurring all over the place.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson was nothing more than a sitting duck, unable to do anything until his enemy attacks. Just like in training, he closed his eyes and listened for the sounds of Aqua&rsquo;s footsteps. At first, he heard nothing but the native sounds of the forest, but just like he learned in training, this is normal.</p></p>

<p><p>His ears isolated the sounds of the forest. First he noticed the birds chirping&#8230;then he heard only the wind and the trees blowing. Then he heard faint footsteps &ndash; at last! Aqua&rsquo;s footsteps grew louder as his distance closed in. *Doosh doosh* From those sounds, he can pinpoint Aqua&rsquo;s location.</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua charged at him and punched, Tyson blocked it, much to his surprise. &ldquo;What?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson smiled, and punched him in the chest. *Wham* Aqua was thrown against a tree.</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua wiped the blood off his mouth. &ldquo;Why you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmph. Just because I can&rsquo;t see you doesn&rsquo;t mean I can&rsquo;t find you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua grunted angrily. &ldquo;Heh, you must have a sharp sense of hearing. But I can fix that.&rdquo; He fired beams at random, causing explosions around them.</p></p>

<p><p>The explosions resulted in massive fires. Aqua grinned evilly, and Tyson&rsquo;s stern expression did not change. He knew what Aqua&rsquo;s plan is: the sound of the flames would distract Tyson&rsquo;s hearing.</p></p>

<p><p>Now that he&rsquo;s certain of his victory, Aqua vanished into the forest. &ldquo;How are you going to find me now?&rdquo; said his echo-like voice. &ldquo;Ha ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson&rsquo;s eyeballs darted left and right, but found nothing. He closed his eyes and concentrated on his hearing, but the sound of the fires were too loud. The burning flames drowned out all the other sounds of the forest, especially Aqua&rsquo;s footsteps.</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua ran all over the place, to decrease the chances of him being found. Claws came out of his gloves, and this time he&rsquo;s going for the finishing move.</p></p>

<p><p>Sweat dripped down Tyson&rsquo;s head. Each second that passes by is one second closer to death. His ears are useless, his eyes are useless, and he has no other sense he can use. What can he possibly do in this life and death situation? Is there no solution for him other than to await the Grim Reaper?</p></p>

<p><p>Maybe there is one way. Zelfire mentioned that there is something beyond the sixth sense&#8230;you can&rsquo;t sense someone&rsquo;s ki, but you can still sense their life force. All living things have this life force, and no matter what technology they use, they cannot hide it. If only Tyson can find Aqua&rsquo;s life force somehow. But does he have enough time?</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua appeared from behind. He charged at him, ready to sink his claws into Tyson&rsquo;s neck. With each passing moment, he came closer and closer.</p></p>

<p><p>Just now, Tyson sensed his life force, and he turned around to face Aqua. He fired the Wrath Beam in his direction. From this distance, Aqua took the blast head on. *Bammm* Aqua&rsquo;s body was pushed back by the beam. &ldquo;Nooooooo!&rdquo; The energy was too intense for him to handle, and his body disintegrated.</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="g">[ G ] - Blue Sings the Blues </span></p></center>

<p><p>Tyson panted for breath as he absorbed what happened. He was close to death just moments ago, but now that Aqua is destroyed, he&rsquo;s safe. But the danger is still not over. His senses indicated that Zelfire&rsquo;s ki vanished, and the same goes for Nebula&rsquo;s ki.</p></p>

<p><p>Then Blue appeared. &ldquo;Even Aqua was defeated. I have to give you credit. No one has defeated the Assassin Squad before.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who the heck are you supposed to be?&rdquo; Tyson said. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t there supposed to be three members of the Assassin Squad?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Those three follow my orders.&rdquo;<br>  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Commander Blue?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;In the flesh. I never expected to be dealing with a second stage sayan. But even you have your limits.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Are you going to turn invisible just like your goons? I can tell you that&rsquo;s not going to work.&rdquo; said Tyson.</p></p>

<p><p>The metallic claws came out of his backpack. Tyson&rsquo;s reaction was the same as Nebula&rsquo;s - he was completely shocked by what he saw.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You see. My underlings can turn invisible and catch the enemy off guard, that&rsquo;s their specialty. But my specialty is a little different.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The front claws try to stab Tyson, who dodges them at lightning fast speed. They stabbed left and right, while he jumped away. *Doosh doosh*</p></p>

<p><p>Blue continued to talk while he attacked. &ldquo;I can control these claws with my thoughts. I don&rsquo;t even have to lift a finger.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson continued to dodge. &ldquo;Is bragging your specialty?&rdquo; He fired a beam and the claws blocked them. Nothing happened. &ldquo;What, not even a scratch?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, did I mention that they&rsquo;re made of titanium alloy, the strongest metal in the universe?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The claws tried to grab him, Tyson dodges them. One second too slow and he&rsquo;s mincemeat. On the ground he&rsquo;s nothing but lamb for the slaughter, so he flew up. Blue chased him. Tyson flew up higher, trying to keep the distance. Blue&rsquo;s speed was slightly slower, due to the fact that he had more weight to carry.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson shot energy balls. Blue&rsquo;s claws protected him from the balls. *Bam* &ldquo;It&rsquo;s useless!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Then how about this?&rdquo; Tyson fired the Wrath Beam. Blue&rsquo;s claws protected his body, taking the beam head on. But the beam was too strong and it pushed him back, all the way back, slamming him against his spaceship. *Wham*</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;AS1_Escape_Lab&quot;></a>Escape From The Lab</p></p>

<p><p>The doc was typing frantically on the computer, until he felt the shock. It&rsquo;s as if there&rsquo;s an earthquake inside the ship; glass tubes broke, and circuits were torn apart. The doctor fell on his keyboard. &ldquo;Ugh! What was that?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The metallic cuff on Faith&rsquo;s right hand deactivated, freeing her hand. The doc did not notice, he was too busy analyzing the ship&rsquo;s damage. This is her one chance to escape, she thought. Near her was a remote control that will deactivate all the metallic cuffs. She reached it with her right hand, but her fingers slightly grazed it. Faith reached with all her might, but couldn&rsquo;t touch the button.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue was still a little dazed from the impact. Once he regained his composure, he got off the ship and flew up. Tyson shot a beam, and Blue countered with his own beam, and the two energies cancelled out. Blue flew towards Tyson and whacked him with the claws.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson was spiraling downwards until he hit the ground. Falling from that height, his crash caused a crater and a big explosion.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith finally reached the remote control and pressed the button. *Click* In an instant, the metallic cuff on her left arm was released, and the cuffs on her ankles were released. She got off the metal bed, and snuck around the lab, looking for something to wear. The only thing closest to her was the pink towel she was wearing before, so she grabbed it and wrapped it around herself. This time, she will keep it on and never let it leave her body.</p></p>

<p><p>The doc turned around and saw her. &ldquo;Hey! What&rsquo;re you doing?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith gasped and moved backwards, as he approached.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Trying to take advantage of the confusion to escape, eh? I don&rsquo;t think so!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith backed up against the metallic bed, and she had no where to go. The doc grabbed her arms and they struggled. He overpowered her, and forced her to lie down. He laughed maniacally. &ldquo;Heh heh heh heh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She grabbed his hand and shoved it into the circuits, which electrified him. Faith quickly got out of the way, lest she should feel the electricity as well. The doc screamed in pain as the electricity surged throughout his body, frying him. &ldquo;Aaaah! Uuuugh!&rdquo; He fell down, his body crispy and smoking.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith hurried over to the exit, pressed the red button, and the door opened. Once she leaves this hellhole of a lab, she will be free at last.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue stood there with his arms crossed, expecting some good news. When the dust cleared and the smoke settled, Tyson was still alive, much to his disappointment. &ldquo;Oh, quite the resilient one, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sayans don&rsquo;t just perish like that.&rdquo; Tyson said, wiping the blood off his smirk.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue&rsquo;s claws aimed for Tyson, he jumped up, but one of the claws opened itself up, much like how a crab opens its claws to catch its prey. Tyson was caught in the black metal, and he used his strength to pry it apart. However, his strength did nothing to metal.</p></p>

<p><p>Another black claw went for Tyson&rsquo;s face, and Tyson grabbed it and held it in place.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t blow you to smithereens, I&rsquo;ll break your neck!&rdquo; said Blue.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson was now in a desperate pinch &ndash; his stomach was being squished by the claw, and there was another claw that&rsquo;s about to snap his head in two. He used all his strength to keep the claw from going near his face, but his muscles could only do so much against the hardened alloy.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use.&rdquo; said Blue. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t break titanium alloy. It&rsquo;s going to rip you to shreds!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I think not!&rdquo; Tyson took the claw in his hands and smashed it into the claw that was holding his stomach captive. *Clang* Now he was free, and he flew away. The situation has changed &ndash; now that Blue has one less claw he can use.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue got angry and started to fire beams. They all missed Tyson, who didn&rsquo;t even dodge. He formed the energy disk in his palm and threw it at Blue, and it cut off three of his claws. *Slash*</p></p>

<p><p>Without any balance, he fell down. &ldquo;Ugh! This can&rsquo;t be happening.&rdquo; The claws retracted back into his backpack.</p></p>

<p><p>The super sayan approached him. Blue, without his claws, is no match for a super sayan. &ldquo;No wait&#8230;can&rsquo;t we talk about this first?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What is there to talk about?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s settle this like gentlemen!&rdquo; Blue blurted out in a desperate tone of voice. &ldquo;We have no grudges with each other.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Why should I care what you have to say?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Blue fired a beam at the ground, blowing smoke into Tyson&rsquo;s face, and he ran away. Suddenly Tyson appeared in front of him, causing Blue to gasp in surprise.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I should&rsquo;ve known you&rsquo;re a coward.&rdquo; Tyson gave him a good punch in the face, one that will give him nightmares later on. *Kapow* Blue sure felt it good, it&rsquo;s one of those bone shattering punches that leaves a bruise for a while. Tyson then punched him in the chest, breaking some of his ribs, knocking him into the ground.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve&#8230;lost?&rdquo; Blue murmured in shock. This is the first time he has felt such pain, and not to mention the first time he lost a fight.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson powered down, and his hair turned to black again. Nebula and Zelfire show up. &ldquo;So, it looks like you cleaned up the trash.&rdquo; said Nebula, referring to the battered up Blue.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The question is, what should we do with him now?&rdquo; asked Zelfire.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Good question.&rdquo; Tyson said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s kill him.&rdquo; Nebula replied.</p></p>

<p><p>Just then, a spaceship lands on the ground. The door opened, and Angela came out.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re&#8230;Angela?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Blue was surprised. &ldquo;Angela Lianz&#8230;of the Galactic Police?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been trailing you for half a year. And now you&rsquo;ve been caught. You are under arrest in the name of justice.&rdquo; She put handcuffs on Blue. Then she turns to Tyson. &ldquo;Good job in catching this guy. I knew you could do it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Gee, thanks!&rdquo; Tyson replied with enthusiasm.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh by the way, your uncle wants to have a few words with you.&rdquo; Angela pushed a button on this device she has on her wrist, and a hologram of Jerrell appeared.</p></p>

<p><p>[&ldquo;Tyson Spade. Once again I have you to thank for the apprehension of a dangerous criminal.&rdquo;]</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Uncle Jerrell. It&rsquo;s good to see you&#8230;well it&rsquo;s good to see your hologram.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>[&ldquo;Sorry I couldn&rsquo;t make it in person, kiddo. I got a police force to run.&rdquo;]</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I understand. So what&rsquo;s going to happen to Blue?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>[&ldquo;Blue has done many bad things in the past, he must receive the proper punishment for his crimes. He will receive nothing less than a lifetime in prison.&rdquo;]<br>  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good.&rdquo; Tyson replied.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Muraians, on average, live longer than we do.&rdquo; said Angela. &ldquo;So he&rsquo;s going to have plenty of time to think about what he&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s all over, eh?&rdquo; Nebula commented.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you forgetting one thing?&rdquo; Angela inquired.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson face palmed himself. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Faith! I need to find her.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No need. She&rsquo;s in the ship.&rdquo; said Angela, pointing her thumb at the ship.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson hurried over to Angela&rsquo;s ship. The door lowered itself automatically, and there she was, standing there anxiously, waiting to reunite with her lover. Faith was wearing only a towel, but in the moment, it didn&rsquo;t matter to them&#8230;she was glad to be home. Tyson was overjoyed as well, and he walked towards her, and she walked towards him.</p></p>

<p><p>In their excitement, their walking turned into running, and eventually embraced each other.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue laughed out loud, which caught everyone&rsquo;s attention. &ldquo;You think this is over, don&rsquo;t you? There&rsquo;s more to the Assassin Squad than just the four of us. I&rsquo;ll tell you this now &ndash; even if you put me in jail, someone will set me free. Just you wait.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Angela shoved him. &ldquo;In your dreams. The GP prison is a highly secure place.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh, you don&rsquo;t get it, do you, police officer? Being invisible is only one of our many talents. We have members who can slip into the headquarters undetected. You&rsquo;re nothing but babies compared to us. Even if you arrest me, there are others like me out there, no, they are even more powerful than me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo; Angela said sternly.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You say you&rsquo;re serving justice, what a joke! No matter how many people you arrest, there are still many assassins out there. Innocent people will be killed, this is something you can never prevent. Everything you&rsquo;ve done for your justice is futile! Ha ha ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong!&rdquo; Faith interjected. &ldquo;There will always be people like you, hurting innocent people for greed and power&#8230;but whenever there is evil, there is justice. Like the Galactic Police.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Everybody noticed how passionate Faith was in her speech, and they all agreed with her mentally. She clenched her fists and continued. &ldquo;Only you would think that fighting for justice and doing the right thing is futile. Ultimately, only the forces of good and love will triumph. It is something you will never understand!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>After she was done there was a triumphant silence. Everyone except for Blue was impressed by her speech and showed a face of approval. Nebula nodded while Tyson smiled.</p></p>

<p><p>The knot on her towel slipped and the towel fell off her chest. It dropped to her feet. *Plop*</p></p>

<p><p>Everybody was dumbfounded at what they saw&#8230;even Angela&rsquo;s mouth grew wide open. Nebula covered his eyes, and Zelfire turned around. Tyson too covered his eyes, his face blushing.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith looked down and she was momentarily shocked that she was naked in front of all these people. She screamed instinctively, and quickly reached down to grab her towel and covered her front.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hey don&rsquo;t look!&rdquo; Angela yelled. She punched Blue in the stomach and he groaned in pain.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson stood in front of her to help cover her up. &ldquo;Well I think it&rsquo;s time we wrap things up.&rdquo; said Tyson nervously. Faith quickly wrapped the towel around herself nervously and hid behind him. She was so embarrassed that she couldn&rsquo;t look at anybody.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Alright. It&rsquo;s time for me to go.&rdquo; Angela took Blue back into the spaceship, and it rocketed off into the sky.</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire, along with Nebula flew off, waving goodbye.</p></p>

<p><p>Now Tyson and Faith are alone and facing each other. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so embarrassed!&rdquo; she said, clenching the towel close to her chest. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that happened in front of everyone.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well...uhhh it happened so fast that they didn&rsquo;t see anything.&rdquo; Tyson replied, trying to comfort her. Then he let out a nervous chuckle. &ldquo;Uh hah hah...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was depressed and staring at the floor.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson put his hand on her shoulders, surprising her a bit. &ldquo;Faith, I agree with what you said. As long as the forces of good exist, we have no reason to fear the forces of evil. When you disappeared, I was afraid that I&rsquo;d lose you. I realized how lucky I am to have you&#8230;by my side.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tyson&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They look into each other&rsquo;s eyes and saw nothing but admiration and love. They&rsquo;ve been separated for a short time, but after everything that&rsquo;s happened, it felt like a long time. They lean in close and closed their eyes and kissed passionately. Faith&rsquo;s arms wrapped around Tyson&rsquo;s neck as his arms embrace her back. The rocket ship is nothing but a small spec in the sky, and it disappeared into the background.</p></p>

<p> <p>The End</p></p>
