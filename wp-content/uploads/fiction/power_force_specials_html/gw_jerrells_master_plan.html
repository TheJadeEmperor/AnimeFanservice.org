<p> <p>Destructo has been beaten, but Malin and Margarita were still having trouble with respective opponents.</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus: (So, Destructo has been defeated. I knew he was worthless. It&rsquo;s time to speed things up.)</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s finish this!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus: &ldquo;I was thinking the same thing.&rdquo; He fired a bunch of energy beams, and so did Margrit. <strong>Kaboom! </strong>Explosions were everywhere. It&rsquo;s all luck now.</p></p>

<p><p>Malin dodged the deadly fireball that Goldark turned into. Wham! She jumped from mountain to mountain, as the fiery ball chased her. Wham!</p></p>

<p><p>Malin turned around, and waited for him to come. He slammed her against the wall. Then he backed away, and fired beams at her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aaaah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh, that should dispose of the garbage.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who ya calling garbage, you garbage?&rdquo; Malin popped out from the wall and hit him, knocking him down.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, she had a flashback.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now Malin, try blowing up that rock over there.&rdquo; said an adult.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Okay!&rdquo; said the little kid Malin, with much enthusiasm. She did what she always did. Gather energy, turn it into a ball, and threw it. Kabam. But it hit the side of the rock.</p></p>

<p><p>Malin&rsquo;s father smacked her on the head. &ldquo;Wrong! You didn&rsquo;t do it right. Now do it again.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin fired again, but missed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Idiot!&rdquo; her father shouted. &ldquo;Why do you keep messing up? In the battlefield, one mistake can mean life and death. Why can&rsquo;t you get it right?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, papa.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been through this hundreds of times!&rdquo; He took out a whip and started whipping her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh! Stop! Papa! I&rsquo;m sorry!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>But her papa wasn&rsquo;t here anymore. She still believed what he said. Mistakes are inexcusable.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Goldark recovered. He charged forward. Malin knew he was bigger and bulkier than her, and taking him directly won&rsquo;t do. She jumped to the air. Goldark blurred and hit her, and she lost control of herself.</p></p>

<p><p>(I&rsquo;m sorry papa, but I messed up again.) Suddenly, another flash back occurred. She remembered the bastard soldiers who took her father away, and she had to run away from them.</p></p>

<p><p>She thought about the fight with Margarita, how much it meant to her and both of them. She quickly regained control of herself just before she hit the dirt. She landed on her hands, and bounced to her feet.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made another mistake.&rdquo; she said with a smile on her lips.</p></p>

<p><p>Goldark screamed and rammed into, slamming her against the wall. He punched her silly, and she coughed blood on Goldark&rsquo;s eyes. He moaned as he tried to get it off.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh! You dirty bitch!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>With this golden chance, Malin began the counter attack, she punched his chest a dozen times, Goldark punched, Malin jumped up, kicking his face. Wham! His scouter broke. He scraped the floor from the hit. Scrrrrr.</p></p>

<p><p>Finally, she realized that messing it up doesn&rsquo;t matter. This time, making a mistake actually helped her. Is this the lesson that Margarita was trying to tell her?</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Brother, thank you for raising me all these years. I know it must&rsquo;ve been tough to raise someone like me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus came from the sky and attacked, Margrit jumped away. Bam.</p></p>

<p><p>Goldark turned his body into a fire ball and hurled like a tornado, Malin kept on dodging. It went past her, and scraped her arm, making her bleed. &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; The scar was in the almost the same spot as her other scar.</p></p>

<p><p> Suddenly, a robot&rsquo;s laser nearly hit her, she dodged, and it scratched her arm. &ldquo;Aaah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Everyone was surprise, even Margrit, who didn&rsquo;t say a word. Malin got angry and fired a full blast the cyborg. Kaboom! The terrain was damaged beyond recognition.</p></p>

<p><p>Thinking back, it was silly to get upset over a little mistake like that. It&rsquo;s just a training simulator. Nothing more.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Alright, bring it on, ugly gorilla!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Goldark hurled at her, and she took the hit. While they charged in the air, Malin grabbed Goldark and directed him towards a mountain. Just before they hit, Malin jumped away, and Goldark ended up hitting the mountain. Bam.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh&#8230;&rdquo; Goldark was all messed up now.</p></p>

<p><p>Malin fired a Multi-Directional Blast at him, and he screamed. <strong>Boom! </strong></p></p>

<p><p>Both Destructo and Goldark are done. Now it&rsquo;s only Nimbus.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell was still resting, as he could barely move a muscle.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to suffer the same fate as your father, Margarita Florencia!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if I never finished the Simulator, Margrit thought. I have everything I need to win. She gathered energy into her palm and closed her fist.</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus was curious as to what she&rsquo;s going to do. He charged, and she charged. They brawled some more. Pak pok pak pok. They kept on hitting each other, especially in the face. Pow! Nimbus punched her face, and she fell. She threw the Concentrated Orb at him, and by the time he realized what it was, it was too late. The orb hit his stomach, pushing him back, and exploded. Kaboom!</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit fell on her knees. &ldquo;I did it&#8230;I did it!!&rdquo; she yelled happily. By now, she was all messed up. Dirt was all over her clothes. Bruises her on her face and arms. But it&rsquo;s all over now.</p></p>

<p><p>Or at least she thought. Nimbus popped out from the ground, more angry than ever. His energy flowed, and it showed his anger. &ldquo;Aaaaaaaah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit was shocked. &ldquo;This can&rsquo;t be&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus&rsquo;s combat suit was mostly gone, and the bottom of his pants were gone as well. He ripped off his suit. There were scars on his body. &ldquo;Yaaaahhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But he took a direct hit&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus fell on his knees. &ldquo;Ugh...you&#8230;you&rsquo;ve done it now. How can a weakling do something like this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita was still shocked by his survival. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be&#8230;he took a direct hit.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Margarita, don&rsquo;t be afraid. You have to fight back.&rdquo; said Jerrell&rsquo;s voice from the ear piece.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What am I going to do now?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus got up. &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve outdone yourself this time. I have to admit, you surprised me. But even weaklings get lucky once in a while.&rdquo; He took out a little tube from his pocket. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m afraid this little game is over.&rdquo; He drank the green liquid inside the tube.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha. Someone like you wouldn&rsquo;t know. Scientists have tried for centuries to create the perfect weapon. How can one harness the sixth sense to its full potential? This question has baffled scientists for a long, long time. They concluded that a frail body of a sayan cannot possibly contain the power of the ultimate warrior. So they came up with a formula that can make people transform into something else. Something they call the <strong>Chimera</strong>. The Chimera is a legendary monster who kills without mercy. No warrior has ever been able to slave the Chimera. And whoever drinks this formula shall become the Chimera.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The Chimera?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My transformation will be complete within a few minutes.&rdquo; His body began to change. His muscles grew in size. His fingers turned into claws. His teeth grew sharper. &ldquo;No one has ever seen my completed form and lived. I only use this during the most critical situations. It&rsquo;s been a while since I used this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The Chimera? My ass! I&rsquo;m going to kill you before you can transform!&rdquo; She charged at him and punched him against the wall.</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus laughed. He not only wasn&rsquo;t hurt, but he seemed to enjoy the beating. Maybe it&rsquo;s because he knows he&rsquo;ll win. Kapow! She kept punching and beating him up. He made little effort to defend himself, since he&rsquo;s in his transforming state. He had little control over his body. Kapow! Pow. Pow.</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell: &ldquo;What power. It&rsquo;s unbelievable.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Pow. Nimbus laughed. Margrit got pissed that her efforts weren&rsquo;t working. Nimbus grew some more. His skin turned white and scaly. &ldquo;Ha ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Stop laughing!&rdquo; She kept on punching and kicking him in the face. Doosh. She elbowed him on the head. And he drooled. Then she kicked him in the face, he fell.</p></p>

<p><p>He got up, still energized. Margrit yelled in frustration and kept on punching.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening over there&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;His fighting level is so high right now&#8230;and it&rsquo;s still going up. When he finishes his transformation&#8230;Margarita&#8230;you gotta be careful.&rdquo; She collapsed.</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell: &ldquo;Damn it. I should be helping her. But my body is not moving. What&rsquo;s wrong with me?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita continued her relentless assault. Wham. Nimbus crashed on the ground. Then she fired a bunch of energy balls at him, and he screamed as he got hit. She finished up with a big beam, and it blew up on him.</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita breathed hard, thinking she did the job. But of course, he&rsquo;s still alive. When the smoke cleared up, Nimbus was still standing, and he was completely transformed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No way.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>His mouth was large and drooling and his sharp dinosaur-like teeth looked lethal. His red staring eyes promised death and his tail lashed the ground, leaving a crack. His skin was white and nothing but armor. He drooled as he looked at the hero. Nimbus roared like a lion.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is the Chimera?</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now you know why I am the most feared sayan in Arlia. Now you know why no one has ever survived a fight with me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No one but me!&rdquo; Margrit said, and charged.</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus jumped to the air, and Margrit noticed how fast he was. He landed behind her, and charged at her. Doosh. She was knocked into a boulder. Wham.</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus ran at her, and she jumped away. Now, he was on the offensive, and Margrit was on the defensive, not wanting to get scratched by his claws. Punching and scratching are two different things. Nimbus scratched and clawed like crazy. Margrit dodged. Whoosh. Whoosh.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Not attacking anymore?&rdquo; he said as he chased her.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit flew backwards, as he advanced and kept scratching. She crossed her arms to block, and he punched her into a boulder. He punched her stomach, and she felt the wind knocked out of her. She collapsed. Nimbus grabbed her head and lifted her up.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, weakling? Am I too strong for you?&rdquo; He put his claws in front of her face. &ldquo;Maybe I should add some decorations for you. Har har har har.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;F&#8230;Fuck off!&rdquo; She powered up, pushing him back. She jumped and punched his face.</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus showed no signs of hurt. &ldquo;Is that what you call a punch?&rdquo; He smacked her away. Wham.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Why&#8230;why isn&rsquo;t anything I do working?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus attacked.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Margarita&#8230;don&rsquo;t despair. Do your best.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kabam! Nimbus dived his claws into the ground, making a crater. Margrit flew up in the air, watching the crater being made.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Damn it&#8230;he&rsquo;s too strong.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Nimbus blurred, and appeared in front of her, to her surprise. Wham!</p></p>

<p><p>She fell. She was hurt physically, and her spirit was hurt as well.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This c-can&rsquo;t be happening. Why am I losing?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you why. Because you are a weakling. Just like your father.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>That word again. Suddenly, she flashed back to all the people who said the work &ldquo;weak&rdquo; to her. Is it because it&rsquo;s true? She was second doubting herself now. Why is everyone saying that to her? Can it be true? Are all her efforts done in futility?</p></p>

<p><p>Kapow! Margarita got punched in the face, and hit against a wall. Slam.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha. You&rsquo;re not even a challenge to me anymore.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand&#8230;all these years of training&#8230;what were they for?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been taught by a failure! Lotus was a coward who ran away from Mestopia to avoid war! It&rsquo;s only natural that he&rsquo;s weak. Everything you&rsquo;ve done up to now is futile! No one can beat the Chimera.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No&#8230;it can&rsquo;t be&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t listen to him!&rdquo; said Jerrell&rsquo;s voice over the ear piece.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Can this be&#8230;is this my fate&#8230;have I trained all this time just to die in war?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Margarita&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus fired a red beam, and it blew up, knocking her down. Thud. He kicked her, and she bounced like a ball on the ground. She coughed blood. &ldquo;Jerrell&#8230;brother&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Margarita, you have to hang on. Don&rsquo;t give up.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But&#8230;I can&rsquo;t even fight back. How can I win? I&rsquo;m just a weakling&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Damn it. Listen to yourself! This isn&rsquo;t how you talk!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell jumped out of the rock, and fired his gun. Bang. Nimbus&rsquo;s shield blocked the bullet, the bullet dropped on the floor. Klunk. Nimbus, without even looking, opened his palm and fired at Kerell. Bam!</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aaaah!&rdquo; He was knocked away.</p></p>

<p><p>That diversion didn&rsquo;t get her much time.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always tried to keep up with you. But I never did. I can&rsquo;t even finish the last level on the Simulator. What good am I?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Margarita&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus grabbed her by the head, and threw her in the air, and hit her about like a tennis ball. Doosh. Doosh. Doosh. She kept on getting hit in the air, and finally, she fell down. Thud.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Margarita!!&rdquo; Jerrell was sitting there, helpless and frustrated. He decided it&rsquo;s time to tell her the truth about that day. &ldquo;You have to listen to me&#8230;true potential is not determined by how strong you are. It&rsquo;s not the size of the dog in the fight, but the size of the fight in the dog.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Jerrellll&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you just give up like that! I know still got something left in you! Margarita&#8230;listen&#8230;&rdquo; he grew silent. &ldquo;That day&#8230;remember that day when you had a hard time with the program? You nearly died that day. It&rsquo;s because it was on level 20!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit was shocked. Her eyes suddenly opened, her pupils dilated.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, I&rsquo;m not lying. I accidentally left a cup of coffee on the computer. When it spilled, it messed up the program. You actually beat level 20! You just don&rsquo;t know it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&#8230;beat level 20?&rdquo; Margrit remembered that day rather clearly. She had a rough time with cyborg S. And every level after that seemed easy. Is that why?</p></p>

<p><p>It all made sense now. Now she finally knows the truth.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Remember what Master Lotus said. To become a true warrior - when you fall down, you must get back up. You just fell. But that&rsquo;s okay. Get up! Get up and fight!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit felt some new strength in her, something she never felt before. She got up to her knees, and on her feet.</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus: &ldquo;Still not dead? Well, I guess I&rsquo;ll beat you senseless. Sooner or later you&rsquo;re going to die.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No&#8230;you die!&rdquo; Froom! She punched his face non-stop, and uppercut his chin.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? How can you still move after what I did to you?&rdquo; he said in a loud voice.</p></p>

<p><p>She was bleeding from a scratch on the chest, with dried blood on her chin and lips, and bruises all over. A scratch on the face. But she felt none of that. All she felt was&#8230;victory.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go down. Not at least until I avenge my master.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus jumped and scratched, she grabbed his arm and threw him on the floor. Thud. Nimbus got up and roared. He charged, she blurred. Appeared behind him, and grabbed his tail. She swings him round and round, and then let go. Whoosh!</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus grabbed the mountain with the claws on his hands and feet. Margrit appeared and fired a beam. Boom. Nimbus pushed the rocks off him and roared.</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita charged energy. She formed a big, white ball.</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus fired at her, but it didn&rsquo;t affect her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;<strong>Super Energy Bomb</strong>!&rdquo; she threw the ball at him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No&#8230;no!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The big bomb pushed Nimbus away, and it crashed through boulders and through other natural structures, as it burned Nimbus&rsquo;s body. Frooom!</p></p>

<p><p>The monster got off the ball, and the ball kept on going where it&rsquo;s going, and blew up. Kabam. The explosion was atomic.</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus reverted to his normal, sayan form, and he was out of breath. He collapsed, and crawled towards the cliff.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit was completely out of energy, and she collapsed instantly. &ldquo;Brother&#8230;I did it&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;You certainly did, Margarita. You have more potential than I thought. More than anyone thought.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus fell off the cliff clumsily, and he crawled to his space pod. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t forget this, Margarita Florencia.&rdquo; The pod&rsquo;s door closed, and the pod lifted off. Froom.</p></p>

<p><p>It was dawn, the sunrise was beginning. Everything turned bright, especially the sea. Jerrell touched Margrit&rsquo;s shoulder.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You did a good job. Nimbus is one of the best, you know.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I know. And so are we.&rdquo;</p></p>


<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="15">15: Fleeting Memories. </span></p></center>

<p> <p>&ldquo;Super Energy Bomb!&rdquo; Margarita threw the ball at him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No&#8230;no!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The big bomb pushed Nimbus away, and it crashed through boulders and through other natural structures, as it burned Nimbus&rsquo;s body. Frooom!</p></p>

<p><p>The monster got off the ball, and the ball kept on going where it&rsquo;s going, and blew up. Kabam. The explosion was atomic.</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus reverted to his normal, sayan form, and he was out of breath. He collapsed, and crawled towards the cliff.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit was completely out of energy, and she collapsed instantly. &ldquo;Brother&#8230;I did it&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus fell off the cliff clumsily, and he crawled to his space pod. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t forget this, Margarita Florencia.&rdquo; The pod&rsquo;s door closed, and the pod lifted off. Froom.</p></p>

<p><p>It became a sparkle in the sky.</p></p>

<p><p>Destructo: &ldquo;Wait for me!&rdquo; He quickly hurried to his space pod, and lifted off.</p></p>

<p><p>Goldark did the same.</p></p>

<p><p>All the enemies are gone. The danger is over.</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita put some flowers on Lotus&rsquo;s grave. &ldquo;Rest in peace, master. I&rsquo;ll find that bastard one day, and put an end to him for sure.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>After she walked away, Jerrell came. &ldquo;Master. I&rsquo;m sorry we were not able to help. Please bless us in heaven.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>It was dawn, the sunrise was beginning. Everything turned bright, especially the sea. Margrit watched the sunrise and smiled. It&rsquo;s the first time she&rsquo;s actually seen the sunrise on this planet.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That was a close one.&rdquo; Jerrell said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, it is.&rdquo; Margrit said. There was bandage on her forehead and wrists.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell touched his sister&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;You did a good job. Nimbus is one of the best, you know.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I know. And so are we. It&rsquo;s all thanks to your words of encouragement. I couldn&rsquo;t have done it without you, brother.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, it had <strong>nothing</strong> to do with me. It was all you. You passed the last level. You defeated Nimbus. I was just watching on the sidelines, not able to help. But of course, those Loyalists aren&rsquo;t going to let us off easy. They&rsquo;ll surely come after us again. And again. Until we&rsquo;re dead.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You know, I had a feeling that this was going to happen.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This whole war thing.&rdquo; Margrit said. &ldquo;Even if we go to a neutral zone, we will still get attacked. No matter how far away we are, they&rsquo;ll find us. The safest place to go is the also the most dangerous place. That&rsquo;s what Master Lotus taught us. And the most dangerous place is our home, Arlia.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Somehow, I feel the same way. We need to plan our next course of action.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta stared at the healing chamber. Nimbus was resting peacefully amongst the healing liquid. He was wearing nothing but shorts. Wires were attached to the vital points of his body.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Nimbus&#8230;you are supposedly the best sayan all around. Next to me. Who could&rsquo;ve done this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It must be someone strong, right, dear brother?&rdquo; <strong>Sephia</strong> said, walking towards him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Or someone lucky.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Our dear Nimbus does not play by luck.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I will need to investigate into this matter.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh no, dear brother. You need not go all the way to T-5. That place is a dump. That&rsquo;s why you have your dear sister at your convenience.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You want to go for this mission?&rdquo; Vegeta asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Why, of course. What is a sidekick for?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Very well, then. You shall be in charge of this matter.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Really? I can? Thank you, big brother!&rdquo; she yelled enthusiastically. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting for something exciting for ages!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Try not to make a big mess.&rdquo; Vegeta said, knowing how she tends to do things.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But of course. I will make this quick and snappy.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How many men will you need?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ten to twenty should do fine.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But of course. Henchmen are useless most of time. The main asset of the mission is myself, of course. I will dispose of those refugee sayans.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Destructo and Goldark dragged Nimbus into the healing chamber. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare tell anyone about this. It will surely ruin my reputation. You got it?!&rdquo; Nimbus said, just before he passed out.</p></p>

<p><p>After putting him into the chamber and setting up the conditions for the machine, Destructo walked in the dark hallway. &ldquo;Damn, that guy sure is troublesome.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia was in front of him. &ldquo;My dear friend Destructo. I heard about the bad news. I feel sympathy for the five of you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Lord Sephia&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh please, you need not be so formal when my brother is not here. We&rsquo;re all friends, are we not? So tell me, who could&rsquo;ve done such a horrible thing?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sayan&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;A Rebel sayan?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes. By the name of Margarita Florencia.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Florencia?&rdquo; Sephia said. &ldquo;Florencia, as in Jeremiah Florencia?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmmm. Margarita. This is indeed interesting.&rdquo; The name Margarita sounded very familiar, for some reason. &ldquo;Very well. I&rsquo;d appreciate it if you do not tell my brother this information.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s keep it a secret between us, shall we?&rdquo; Sephia said, winking.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Y-Yes.&rdquo; Destructo had to submit. He knew that she can be scarier than her brother sometimes.</p></p>

<p><p>And so, Sephia and her soldiers set off in a light-class spaceship, going towards none other than Ruskus. A rush of excitement came over Sephia, as she hardly ever gets to leave Arlia. This is a one in a lifetime opportunity.</p></p>

<p><p>The temple is now damaged, the roof is mostly missing. The heroes sat on the floor, facing each other, discussing the situation.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Margarita, you&rsquo;ve done an outstanding job. It just makes me happy to see you all grown up now.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;Yeah. You&rsquo;ve taught me many things.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Magarita blushed. &ldquo;Oh guys, it&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I wasn&rsquo;t able to help.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; Margrit said, not wanting him to feel bad. &ldquo;You did what you could.&rdquo; She touched his shoulder.</p></p>

<p><p>He felt a little better.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;The good news is that we defeated Nimbus and his morons. But the bad news is&#8230;he&rsquo;s still alive. And someone else will come after us. Those bastards in Arlia won&rsquo;t let us off easily.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;Are they going to start a war with Ruskus?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;No. Doing that would be a huge disadvantage for them. They have their hands full with the Rebels already.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell: &ldquo;Jerrell is right. It&rsquo;s true if you think about it. Would they fight a whole planet just to get the four of us?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll never know. Sayans are crazy sometimes.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;But there is no doubt they want us dead. And staying here isn&rsquo;t going to help. They&rsquo;ll find us eventually. That&rsquo;s why we need a plan.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell: &ldquo;So&#8230;anyone got any ideas?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell stood up. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it, guys. I&rsquo;ll come up with something. Just give me one day. Twenty four hours is all I need.&rdquo; He walked out of the room, and went into his room, and locked the door.</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell: &ldquo;Uhhh&#8230;okay&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the meaning of this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They were confused. But Margrit had an idea what he&rsquo;s doing. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry guys.&rdquo; she said, breaking the silence.</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;Margarita&#8230;what the heck is your brother doing? What does he mean, give me one day?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how he is. There&rsquo;s only one other time when I&rsquo;ve seen him like this. It was just before our school exam. The exam was very stressful and difficult. And Jerrell locked himself in his room for a whole day. He didn&rsquo;t eat nor sleep. I don&rsquo;t even know if he went to the bathroom&#8230;I don&rsquo;t want to know. But I&rsquo;m sure he was studying in there. As a result, he passed the test with flying colors. Right now, he&rsquo;s inside that room, making a plan. Not just any plan, but big plans. The longer he stays in there, the bigger it will be.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell: &ldquo;Will this really work?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You have trust my brother. He&rsquo;ll have everything figured out. I know it. You may not notice, but he&rsquo;s a genius at planning. Sometimes, instead of training, he&rsquo;d spend his time planning and making new techniques. I believe in him.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;So we don&rsquo;t have to worry about a thing?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Nope. Whatever Jerrell comes up with, I will go along with it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The other two rests assured.</p></p>

<p><p>Inside his room, Jerrell sat down, legs crossed, arms crossed, eyes closed. He was in deep thought.</p></p>

<p><p>As Margarita stood along the shore, Malin came to join her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a lot on your mind, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Malin asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. It&rsquo;s just that...I knew that one day I will be going back to Arlia. Call it fate or whatever you want. But that&rsquo;s where I came from. That&rsquo;s where my sayan legacy is. And that&rsquo;s where it will end.&rdquo; Margrit said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I see. I feel the same way. We have a similar background, ya know? By the way, how did you beat Nimbus?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin was surprised by her answer.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Something just came over me. I just took control of my power. It&rsquo;s hard to explain.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>While waiting inside her spaceship, Sephia fell asleep on her chair with her arms crossed. She had a peculiar dream&#8230;a dream about an event that happened a while back.</p></p>

<p><p>Little Sephia listened as her brother gave her some very important instructions. Her usual attire was a black ninja suit, with a red sweater on top. Although she&rsquo;s only a little girl, there&rsquo;s something unusual about her. Sayans are violent by nature, but she is extra violent, particular for her age. Maybe it&rsquo;s because she is Vegeta&rsquo;s sister. Or maybe it&rsquo;s just the way she is.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now listen, Sephia. I have to go on an important mission today. I am going to trust the lab with you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; she answered with a big smile.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So don&rsquo;t mess anything up in headquarters, got it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Okay!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>And with that said, he left. He hardly told her anything. She thought this was because he considered her too young and naive and inexperienced. That really made her upset. Very very upset.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Stupid brother! He has a mission so he left and I&rsquo;m stuck here all alone! With nothing to do.&rdquo; Sephia sighed.</p></p>

<p><p>Sitting on a chair, browsing through the computer files was hardly fun. She yawned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so bored.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She went around the headquarters. She&rsquo;s never seen all of it, because her brother wouldn&rsquo;t let her. Well, he&rsquo;s gone now. So it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to have a look around...</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia went to the dungeon. She just remembered her brother telling her there was somebody really dangerous trapped in here.</p></p>

<p><p>She reached a particular cell, one that was separated from the others. There was chained man inside. Darkness was all around him. Rats crawled up the wall. A big spider hung from a web. Suddenly, there was light.</p></p>

<p><p>The man looked up. He never had any visitors, so this was a surprise. He saw a little girl.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oooh, poor poor big brother. Trapped in here and all alone.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Is that you, Sephia?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;m the one and only Sephia.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How did you...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My other big brother has left for a mission. So guess what? He left me here <strong>all alone</strong>. But from the way things look, you are more alone than me, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Try being locked up by your own brother. I&rsquo;ve been here for as long as I remember.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Why would my dear brother be this cruel?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Because we are twins. I have no name of my own, so I use his name. He fears that one day I might become stronger and betray him. So if he betrays me first, then there will be no problem. He only releases me if he needs me for an emergency.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell ya what. I can get you out of this miserable place if you promise me something.&rdquo; she said, flinging the keys around her forefinger.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d take me out of here? Then name it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Take me to a fun place.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;A fun place, eh? It&rsquo;s a deal.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hehehehe.&rdquo; Sephia put the key into the keyhole. The bars went up.</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta stepped out. He lifted Sephia up and they touched on the cheeks. They laughed. &ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s go have some fun.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>In a wrecked city, there was silence under a red sky. A little girl was crying. A soldier heard a faint voice and went towards the source. He found a little girl in a red dress crying on the floor. He went to her and bent down.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, little girl?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Waaah! I&rsquo;m lost and I can&rsquo;t find my mama and papa!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ohhh don&rsquo;t worry honey, I&rsquo;ll help you. I&rsquo;ll take you to headquarters and make a report, and then we can find your mommy and daddy.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She stopped crying. &ldquo;You know what?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She smiled sinisterly. &ldquo;You fell for it.&rdquo; Bam! She fired an energy beam through his stomach. He was completely taken by surprise, and fell and died seconds later. &ldquo;Oops. I didn&rsquo;t mean to. Hehehehehehe.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; another soldier called out. A bunch of them stopped when they saw the girl with the fallen soldier.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta landed in front of them and blasted them. Boom! Two guys died instantly. The rest were confused and shocked. A cloud of smoke formed and the soldiers ran out of it. When the smoke cleared, Vegeta and Sephia were seen.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s...it&rsquo;s Vegeta!&rdquo; one of them yelled.</p></p>

<p><p>The brother and sister fired energy balls and hitting people. The Rebel forces arrived and fired laser guns. Bang bang bang. Vegeta and Sephia soared up. Vegeta went past a group of soldiers, who fired at him. They were nervous and scared. Boom! A fireball hit them and destroyed them. Sephia randomly fired energy balls in every direction, hitting someone or something every once in a while.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Run! Run for your lives!&rdquo; a rebel shouted. Boom! He died.</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta and his sister laughed. He powered up. &ldquo;Watch this.&rdquo; He blasted a big fireball, a move he called the <strong>Ultimate Dark Blast</strong>, and it looked like a comet. It hurled towards the city. Boom! A piece of the ground blew up, creating a crater. Wrecked buildings around it were destroyed.</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia&rsquo;s eyes opened slightly, but she continued dreaming. After Little Sephia and Vegeta II&rsquo;s little escapade, they got caught, naturally. Vegeta II was able to flee, but Sephia, on the other hand, was not so lucky.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You little wretch&#8230;&rdquo; Vegeta yelled angrily. &ldquo;How dare you&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The little girl was trembling. &ldquo;B-Brother&#8230;I&rsquo;m&#8230;sorry&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sorry? I put you in charge of my base. And what do you do? You free my brother!! Now he&rsquo;s on the loose!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have done it! I&rsquo;m sorry!&rdquo; she said, moving back until she hit a wall.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given you too much freedom here. I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re going to be punished, young lady.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please&#8230;don&rsquo;t kill me!&rdquo; she said, with her arms over her neck.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh no&#8230;I won&rsquo;t kill you.&rdquo; Vegeta said, and powered up. His body began changing&#8230;transforming into the Sith.</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia watched in horror. She&rsquo;s seen many things, but nothing as shocking and scary as this.</p></p>

<p><p>The creature known as her brother growled and drooled as he turned into some sort of monster with claws and talons. Sephia screamed.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Sephia opened her eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; said one of her soldiers, &ldquo;We have arrived at our destination. T-5.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Excellent. Begin the operation.&rdquo; Sephia took a deep sigh. She remembered that event very clearly and vividly, unfortunately. Her brother&rsquo;s punishment could not be forgotten. It still gives her the creeps today.</p></p>

<p><p>The ship&rsquo;s door opened, making a diagonal walkway from the ground to the door. Soldiers walked out. Sephia walked out, and began giving instructions.</p></p>

<p><p>A spy was watching them from a distance away. &ldquo;Only one first class soldier? Hmmm&#8230;very interesting.&rdquo; <strong>Coal</strong> said.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit was still at the beach shore, thinking about the battle between herself and Nimbus. She did a lot of things right, and a lot of things wrong. But she won, that&rsquo;s all that matters&#8230;right? She powered up and extended her arms forward. &ldquo;Hyah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>On the water, she made two big splashes. Frooom.</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="16">16: Margarita vs. Sephia! A Deadly Fight! </span></p></center>

<p> <p>Sephia and her men were busy unloading weapons from the ship, as a mysterious stranger watched them.</p></p>

<p><p>While in the middle of training, Margarita sensed someone close by. She quickly went to the grave site. To her surprise, it was just Moku, paying his respects to his late friend.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Moku&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, Margarita. How goes things?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going okay.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We were friends for many years. And in the end, I wasn&rsquo;t able to do a thing to help him. Not a damn thing.&rdquo; he said, his fists tightening.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit noticed that he had bandages on his face. &ldquo;You did what you could. You are not a warrior like us. Please, don&rsquo;t blame yourself. We were not able to save him either. &rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You and Jerrell were his best students. All the others whom he taught, they all left. They just used him and left him. They used his training for their own selfish needs.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Me and Jerrell are no different. We wanted master to train us so we can get revenge.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I guess he the people he cared about most was you two. He doesn&rsquo;t have any family. No children. He treated you like his daughter and son.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit was a bit shocked. &ldquo;I see. He <strong>was</strong> like a father to us.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Margarita&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Get all the revenge for him that you can. While wandering in the forest this morning, I found a foreign space ship.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Margrit said, looking at him intensely.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No doubt they are Loyalists. I don&rsquo;t know what they want here, but I know they are up to no good.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I see. Thank you, Mr. Moku.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell was still inside his room, thinking in solitude. No one knows what he was doing in there. Not even Margarita knew. She only had an idea.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Alright, so that&rsquo;s the situation.&rdquo; Margrit said.</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell: &ldquo;This Moku guy, is he trustworthy?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a friend of mine. We can trust him.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;It has to be true. After Margarita beat Nimbus, do you think the Loyalists will just let her get away with it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell: &ldquo;I never thought they&rsquo;d go that far. Intrusion into neutral territory.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;What <strong>wouldn&rsquo;t</strong> they do for victory?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit adjusted her sleeves. &ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The three sneaked towards the enemy grounds. They separated, going to different areas. Margrit hid behind the bushes. Kerell sat behind a tree, and Malin was on top of a tree, hidden among its leaves. All three of them had a scouter equippied.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;You see them?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;Sure do.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;How many you think there are?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;About twenty.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell: &ldquo;I counted twenty five.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;But who&rsquo;s that girl? Is she the one in charge?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;Apparently so. She&rsquo;s their leader.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia: &ldquo;Alright, hurry up with that, you slow pokes.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The soldiers carried boxes and boxes of weapons onto the ground. Some of them remained on guard, watching for the enemy.</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia: &ldquo;Hurry up with it, slackers! Or my brother will be very upset. And you don&rsquo;t want that to happen, do you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Ms. Sephia.&rdquo; one of them said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sheesh. You&rsquo;d think these men can do more, after all their training.&rdquo; Suddenly, Sephia sensed the heroes nearby. &ldquo;Ohhh, how interesting.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell was watching her carefully from the tree. Her back was facing him, and he didn&rsquo;t see the wicked expression on her face.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hurry up.&rdquo; Sephia shouted at the &lsquo;incompetent&rsquo; soldiers. &ldquo;Otherwise, we might be ambushed. Who knows.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly she turned around and stared straight at Kerell, who was shocked. But then Sephia turned her attention elsewhere &ndash; to a figure walking out from the woods.</p></p>

<p><p>The soldiers got their guns ready, but Sephia made a hand signal to stop them. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not necessary. It&rsquo;s only one man.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: (What?)</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: (Isn&rsquo;t he&#8230;)</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: (Mr. Moku? What&rsquo;s he doing here?)</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re the guy we found spying on us this morning.&rdquo; Sephia said, crossing her arms. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a lot of guts coming back here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I have a question for you. Were you the ones responsible for sending Nimbus to our village?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes. And what about it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Moku&rsquo;s fists were shaking. &ldquo;Nimbus killed my good friend Lotus, and burned down the entire village of Memphis as well. I am here to take revenge for them.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Soldier A: &ldquo;You alone? Ha, you&rsquo;re either very strong&#8230;or very <strong>stupid</strong>.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Maybe both.&rdquo; he said to himself. He powered up and sprints forward.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: (No!!)</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell: (What&rsquo;s he doing?)</p></p>

<p><p>Moku threw a punch, the hardest and angriest one he could conjure up, Sephia ducked, and punched his stomach, and her fist was buried inside, and she fired a beam, which went through him and out his back. Zzzzap.</p></p>

<p><p>All three watchers were shocked. &ldquo;No!!&rdquo; Kerell shouted. Moku collapsed. Sephia smiled, looked at Kerell&rsquo;s direction, and bam! She fired a beam and the tree blew up, and Kerell fell. Crash.</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;Shit!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;She discovered us!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Since they were discovered, it&rsquo;s no use hiding. They jumped out of hiding and revealed themselves. But they were immediately surrounded by a circle of troops.</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia: &ldquo;Two of them? So that makes a total of three. You fools! You sent only three people here to challenge me?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Listen Loyalist scum, this is neutral zone. You&rsquo;re not welcome here. Get lost before you get hurt.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia put her hands on her hips and laughed. Her soldiers laughed with her. &ldquo;You moron! Who are you to challenge my authority?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Name&rsquo;s Margarita.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;And Malin.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia: &ldquo;Very well. I shall engrave those names onto your grave! Attack!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The soldiers attacked. Malin and Margrit fought them off. Kapow! Wham!</p></p>

<p><p>One of them jumped at Margrit, and she kicked him in the stomach, knocking him away. Wham.</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia attacked Margrit while her back was facing her, but Margrit blurred. Sephia was surprised by her speed. (What?!)</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit landed behind her. She looked at her friend&rsquo;s body. &ldquo;Mr. Moku&#8230;you shouldn&rsquo;t have done it! Why? You witch, you&rsquo;re going to pay for this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who you calling a witch?&rdquo; Sephia attacked with karate chops. (How can she be able to defend against my attacks?) Whoosh. Whoosh. (Could she be&#8230;a sayan?) Sephia thought.</p></p>

<p><p>Malin fired a beam. Sephia blocked it, and blasted Malin away.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Noooo! You&rsquo;re going to get it now!&rdquo; She pushed through two soldiers, and went for Sephia directly.</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell got up from the bushes. &ldquo;Ugh&#8230;my head hurts&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>As the two women fought, Kerell shot down the soldiers around them. Bang. Bang. One of them jumped directly in front of him, Kerell threw his gun at his head. Thud. Then he powered up and punched him in the chest. Doosh. His upper body blew up, and his remains landed on the dirt.</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell quickly went to Moku&rsquo;s body. &ldquo;Sir, are you alright?&rdquo; No response. And Kerell was hoping to save him.</p></p>

<p><p>Coal: &ldquo;Hmmm. The Loyalists only sent Sephia here. Is this such a wise choice? Even if she is the sister of General Vegeta, there&rsquo;s three Rebels and one of her.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia: &ldquo;Before I kill you, I want to know something. Who defeated Nimbus?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as I thought. You sent him here, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My brother did.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Your brother?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, my brother, the almighty and well-known Vegeta.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>That name struck Margrit like a ton of bricks. &ldquo;Vegeta&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So, my question. Who defeated Nimbus?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&#8230;you&rsquo;re Vegeta&rsquo;s sister...&rdquo; Margrit said, looking at the floor.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;If you tell me, I&rsquo;ll give you an easy death.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit, without saying another word, charged forward and pushed Sephia. Frooom. They hit each other, jumping from tree to tree. Occasionally, they&rsquo;d blow up some trees.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Margrit was hit by a fireball, and pushed all the way back. Froom.</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia followed the fireball that she shot. When Margrit got up, she was a little dizzy. She realized she&rsquo;s close to the temple. &ldquo;Damn that woman.&rdquo; she muttered.</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia appeared. &ldquo;Now you see our difference in strength, Rebel?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Margarita.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Names are not necessary for dead people.&rdquo;<br>  (I&rsquo;m close to the temple. But at this rate, she&rsquo;s going to blow everything up, including the temple. But I still have <strong>that</strong>.)</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia continued her unrelenting assault, jumping and shooting fireballs. Margrit ran towards the temple and into it. Sephia chased after her in the hallways. Margrit threw a ball on the ground, and blew up smoke. Sephia coughed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo; *Cough cough* These cheap tricks won&rsquo;t work on me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit hurried over to the Simulator Control Room and turned on the program. She typed in some commands. But in the middle of her typing, Sephia broke down the door and blasted her into the window, and into the training room. Bam. Sephia jumped through the window and landed. <br>  Sephia: &ldquo;So this is your little hideout, eh? Not bad.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Me and my brother didn&rsquo;t come here to hide. We came here to train.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, the environment changed. It was now a wasteland.</p></p>

<p><p>[ Level: 20 ]</p></p>

<p><p>[ Terrain: Wasteland ]</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit had a smile on her face, while Sephia had no clue what&rsquo;s happening. &ldquo;What is going on here? Is this an illusion?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes and no.&rdquo; Margrit answered cunningly. &ldquo;This is the Simulator. It&rsquo;s a hologram set up by the computer for training purposes.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;A Simulator? I&rsquo;ve heard of them before. So this is your brilliant plan, Margarita? To bring me here because you can&rsquo;t defeat me alone?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Why fight you normally? That&rsquo;s so plain and boring. This makes it more interesting. Look, our enemies are here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Both charged and started hitting. Wham, wham.</p></p>

<p><p>The first wave of cyborgs came. Sephia swiped her arm once, making a shockwave, and destroyed three of them. Margrit fired a beam at the ground, blowing some of them up.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;So how about it? We fight here. These cyborgs are not on my side. Everyone that is here is their enemy. If I win, you will never come bother us again. You or anyone else&#8230;set foot on Ruskus. But if you win, then I&rsquo;ll tell you who killed Nimbus.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia: &ldquo;Hmph. Interesting. I accept!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin just woke up with a headache. &ldquo;Ugh&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell was right next to her, waiting for her to wake up.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Where is everybody?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I lost Margarita. But I found you unconscious here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;Damn, it&rsquo;s all that bitch&rsquo;s fault. C&rsquo;mon, we gotta find her and Margarita before something bad happens. Oh by the way, what about the soldiers?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it. They&rsquo;re taken care of.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Near Sephia&rsquo;s ship, bodies lay everywhere. Blood was abundant. Kerell finished off the last soldier, and went on his way. No one was spared; everyone was killed in cold blood.</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell: &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, let&rsquo;s go find them.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit and Sephia continued hitting about in the air, and the cyborgs were just nuisances to them. When one came, they just blew it up and continued fighting each other. But then came the flying mines. They flew away from each other and avoid the mines, that came from all directions. It&rsquo;s worse off in the air, so Margrit flew down to the water. Splash. The mines came and exploded. Some of them went deeper, and Margrit swam away. (Swimming is just like flying in the water to her)</p></p>

<p><p>Splash!</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia: &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t get killed that easily!&rdquo; She fired beams at the mines. Kaboom. A bunch of them came like magnets to her, and she formed a shield and released a shockwave. &ldquo;Yaaaaah!&rdquo; Kaboom!</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit came out of the water and hit Sephia. Whack! They kept on kicking and punching non-stop. They end up in a forest, and their destruction continued.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, a figure came from the woods.</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia: &ldquo;Another one?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;No, this is the toughest cyborg&#8230;the Class S Cyborg.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tch. I don&rsquo;t give a damn what class they&rsquo;re in.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>S fired a beam, and both of them jumped away. Froom!</p></p>

<p><p>Cyborg S charged at Margrit and did a full frontal assault. Margrit dodged and kicked it in the head. Wham! While falling, the cyborg fired a double missile. Margrit fired a beam and blew up the missiles, and hit the cyborg, letting it burn as it fell into the woods.</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia: &ldquo;Heh, I could&rsquo;ve done that.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not over yet. There&rsquo;s more of them.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Three Cyborg S&rsquo;s came.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Think you can take them?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s obvious.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s see how tough you are!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The cyborgs attacked. Both sayans jumped away to dodge the lasers. Zap.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit flew to the air, and Cyborg S chased. Frooom. It kept firing heat-seaking missiles. Margrit flew in circles, avoiding the missiles, but they kept a lock on her. She fired some balls to make them blow up.</p></p>

<p><p>S came from behind and hit her. Wham. As she was falling, many thoughts ran through her head. Images of her father being killed appeared. And she was just a little kid, helpless to do anything. And the Nimbus shows up. And suddenly her master is killed. It was too intense for her to handle, and she screamed. She powered up and stopped falling.</p></p>

<p><p>S charged at her from above. She charged at it, not hesitating a bit, and went through the cyborg. Crash!! It fell apart into pieces. Months ago, she could never have done that. But sayans always get stronger. And stronger.</p></p>

<p><p>But Sephia, on the other hand, was having a hard time with the cyborg. She&rsquo;s never fought something like this before.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Die, you piece of tin can!!&rdquo; She fired a red beam, the cyborg dodged and appeared at her height, and blasted her. &ldquo;Ugh!!&rdquo; She was knocked away. S flew after her. She fired a bunch of discs, and cut the cyborg into pieces. She sighed in frustration.</p></p>

<p><p>The third Cyborg S came from behind and fired a beam. Sephia turned around, and realized it&rsquo;s too late to dodge. Suddenly, Margrit&rsquo;s Wrath Beam blew up Cyborg S completely, and Sephia dodged the beam, and it scratched her arm.</p></p>

<p><p>Both warriors landed.</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia: &ldquo;Well, it looks like you win. You&rsquo;re better than I thought.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;And as agreed, you&rsquo;ll never both us again.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia smiled. &ldquo;Fine. A deal is a deal.&rdquo; She turned around and walked away.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, and by the way. Tell your allies&#8230;never mess with Rebels.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Whatever.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita knew they were both out of energy, and fighting any further would be pointless. At least she was satisfied at her own victory. The Simulator once again helped her out.</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="17">17: Next Course Of Action. </span></p></center>

<p> <p>The third Cyborg S came from behind and fired a beam. Sephia turned around, and realized it&rsquo;s too late to dodge. Suddenly, Margrit&rsquo;s Wrath Beam blew up Cyborg S completely, and Sephia dodged the beam, and it scratched her arm.</p></p>

<p><p>Both warriors landed.</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia: &ldquo;Well, it looks like you win. You&rsquo;re better than I thought.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;And as agreed, you&rsquo;ll never both us again.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia smiled. &ldquo;Fine. A deal is a deal.&rdquo; She turned around and walked away.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, and by the way. Tell your allies&#8230;never mess with Rebels.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Whatever.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>After Margarita defeated Sephia, she returned to her spaceship and headed back to Arlia.</p></p>

<p><p>Malin and Kerell went to join Margrit. &ldquo;What happened? Where&rsquo;s Sephia?&rdquo; they said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. I defeated her. She won&rsquo;t be back.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell: &ldquo;Is she dead?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Not quite.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;She got away?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Yeah. But she won&rsquo;t bother us again.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;How do you know that for sure? She works for Vegeta! He&rsquo;s not going to let this go.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Jerrell came outside to join them. All three of them were surprised.</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell: &ldquo;Jerrell&#8230;have you finished planning yet?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Yes I have. I&rsquo;ve made my master plan. And I have already decided our next course of action.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;And that would be&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to Arlia.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They were all shocked.</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;What? That&rsquo;s crazy! There&rsquo;s a war in Arlia! Not a single place is safe!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Are we safe here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;Well&#8230;no&#8230;but still&#8230;the reason why we all fled here is to avoid the war.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;We came here when we were children so we can avoid the war, and train hard, and grow up, so we can be ready to fight. We&rsquo;re all orphans of war. We cannot escape our fate. If we stay here, more and more bad things will happen to this planet. Just like Memok Village. I don&rsquo;t want something like that to repeat.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Everyone felt bad, Margrit stared at the ground.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Brother is right. Sooner or later we have to go back. I still have to take revenge for father. We are Rebels, aren&rsquo;t we? And furthermore, we&rsquo;re sayans. We were meant to fight. We can&rsquo;t escape our destiny.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just too soon.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best thing I can think of. I know people of influence on Arlia. Because of my father. And I will speak with them. Trust me, I know a strategy to win the war. I&rsquo;ve been monitoring the war from here for many years.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Fine. Let&rsquo;s not waste anytime. We&rsquo;ll make preparations.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;Very well then. I will trust your judgment, Jerrell.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell: &ldquo;Sorry guys. I can&rsquo;t come with you. Arlia isn&rsquo;t my home planet, and honestly, I don&rsquo;t want to set foot there. I&rsquo;ve got my own war to fight on Macedonion. Since you will be leaving, I will go back to the Black Hand to report to my superior.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;We understand. It&rsquo;s too bad you won&rsquo;t be joining us. But&#8230;thank you for your help.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Yeah, we appreciate it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell: &ldquo;Anytime.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>And so, the heroes have decided their next course of action.</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita joined Kerell, who was sitting at the rooftop of Lotus&rsquo;s temple. &ldquo;Hey, sorry to bother you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, not at all.&rdquo; Kerell said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going back to the Black Hand, right?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yep. I still have to make a report to Z.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I see. The Black Hand, huh? Sounds interesting&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The Black Hand is regarded as a terrorist organization. But the organization was formed on the premise that innocent civilians shouldn&rsquo;t have to suffer in war. They labeled us as terrorists, but we don&rsquo;t care. In war,&rdquo; Kerell said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not just the soldiers who die. Sometimes civilians get attacked. And they&rsquo;re innocent. Some of us at Macedonion got tired of innocent people getting killed. So the Black Hand was formed &ndash; and it&rsquo;s made up of mostly civilians who are frustrated and pissed off at the current war situation.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve been sent here to monitor the activities of Ruskus. And it&rsquo;s because I failed my last mission.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Your last mission?&rdquo; Margrit asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes. I was supposed to assassinate President Octell. He&rsquo;s the leader of the Loyalists on my planet. And I failed. I&rsquo;ve been sent here to hide for my own safety.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. We all fail missions at some point.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Maybe one day I&rsquo;ll join the Black Hand.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Certainly. We haven&rsquo;t accepted a sayan before, but I&rsquo;m sure the boss would like to meet you. Oh, and by the way, good luck, and take care.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit smiled. &ldquo;Thanks, you too.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The sun was about to set, and they enjoyed the scenery.</p></p>

<p><p>The very next day, the sayan heroes got in their space pods. Jerrell and Margrit shared one &ndash; the same one they took to get to Ruskus a few years ago. Somehow, to Margrit, the pod was smaller. Malin had her own pod. These pods were normally designed to fit one person, but years ago, they felt that it&rsquo;s inefficient for one pod to carry only one person, so they designed pods with two seats. Although the room is cramped, it can fit two people, and it gets them to where they need to go. That&rsquo;s all that matters.</p></p>

<p><p>As the two pods flew off, Kerell waved goodbye. He was glad he made some friends on this planet. And now, back to work.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mmm hmm, yes.&rdquo; I am coming right now.&rdquo; Jerrell said over the intercom. &ldquo;I will see you soon. Transmission over.&rdquo; Jerrell turned the intercom off.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;So, we&rsquo;re finally going home, right?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yep. You nervous?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;A little. Arlia is not exactly the most cheerful place in the universe. If I remember correctly, it&rsquo;s just a barren wasteland.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your impression of it, huh? I don&rsquo;t blame you. Arlia was once a planet that had a plentitude of resources. But the land became barren due to war.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We sayans originally fought together against the Arlians and the Sithians. And now, we&rsquo;re fighting against each other because of some stupid Empire. How ironic.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmph. Indeed it is.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>As the pods flew in space, Margrit had a flash back.</p></p>

<p><p>Either leave, or be hunted down. That was their choice. Jerrell accepted his fate silently. Margarita was still in denial about the whole thing. But regardless, they have to flee for their safety.</p></p>

<p><p>The space pod left Arlia&rsquo;s atmosphere, reaching outer space. Margrit pressed her hands and face against the window. &ldquo;Mommy and daddy&#8230;&rdquo; she said with tears. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re still down there.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>As they stared at the planet, they saw the huge explosions from the war. The war was already raging on.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry Margrit. I&rsquo;ll take care of you. I promise.&rdquo; Jerrell touched his sister&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Everything will be okay.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair!! *Sob* It&rsquo;s not fair!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be alright. I promise.&rdquo; Jerrell said. He was scared too, probably as scared as his sister was. But he was the older brother. Their parents were not here. He had to take charge. No matter how scared he was, or the fact that he&rsquo;s a kid, he&rsquo;s a sayan man, and he had to take charge and protect his little sister. Because she was everything he had. He will never lose her.</p></p>

<p><p>It was touching how strong her brother was back then. And he&rsquo;s still like that today. And now, after all these years, they&rsquo;re going back home. The place where her father was killed. The place where it all started.</p></p>

<p><p>She looked at her brother as he talked to Coitus over the intercom. She knew he must be having similar thoughts as her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, we&rsquo;ve got good news.&rdquo; Coitus announced.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, what is it?&rdquo; Kemia inquired.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We have a special guest coming tomorrow. And he will be joining us in the war.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who could it be?&rdquo; <strong>Liana</strong> asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;They are Rebels from Planet T-5, also known as Ruskus.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kemia: &ldquo;Ruskus&#8230;you mean&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus: &ldquo;Yes. The children of Jeremiah.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p></p>

<p><p>Liana: &ldquo;You mean&#8230;Jerrell&#8230;and Margarita?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> Over these years, King Neflite the First grew old and weary. Sayans live a long life, but his health has deteriorated much because of this war. Constant worrying and frustration caused him much mental stress.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo; *Cough cough* Have you found the Rebel camp at Yeta yet?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Not yet, sire.&rdquo; answered Vegeta. &ldquo;But we are working on it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How much longer is it going to take?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Rest assured, your highness, we have it all under control. It will only be a matter of time before their demise.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Neflite: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve promised me that over and over. Yet we still have the same results.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta: &ldquo;These Rebels are slipperier than rats. We have to hunt them down and exterminate them.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>All the other Elite Guards began chatting amongst each other.</p></p>

<p><p>Neflite: &ldquo;Fine. I will give you one more week. If you still cannot find the camp, then I will send other Generals to aid you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Vegeta said, bowing.</p></p>

<p><p>The two highly anticipated pods landed in the middle of the field. Jerrell, Margrit, and Malin stepped out.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell took a took breath and smelled the air. &ldquo;Ahh, home sweet home.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a foulness in the air. I don&rsquo;t like it. It&rsquo;s sickening.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the smell of blood. There&rsquo;s been too much war happening here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;What&rsquo;d you expect from a place like this? Rainbows and flowers? Oh, here comes our friends.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus, Kemia, and Liana came to greet their guests. &ldquo;Jerrell&#8230;&rdquo; Coitus said.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Mr. Coitus.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They shook hands. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a while.&rdquo; Coitus said. &ldquo;My, you&rsquo;ve grown up. Oh, and this must be your adorable little sister, Margarita.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They shook hands.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Adorable may not be the best word.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done a good job so far.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus: &ldquo;Thank you. Oh, and this is?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a friend of ours. Like us, she&rsquo;s also an orphan of war.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My name is Malin.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus and her shook hands.</p></p>

<p><p>Liana: &ldquo;Jerrell&#8230;it&rsquo;s been a while.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;And you might be&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Liana smiled girlishly. &ldquo;It figures you won&rsquo;t remember me. I&rsquo;m Liana.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Liana?&rdquo; Jerrell repeated. That name sounded really familiar. Then he gasped.</p></p>

<p><p>The little kids were playing on the field of flowers, not having a care in the world. Margrit was playing with the Crystalline flowers, while little Jerrell and little Liana were talking.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hey, this is for you.&rdquo; Jerrell said, handing her a rose.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ooh, thank you, Jerrell.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They both laughed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No way&#8230;you&rsquo;re <strong>that </strong>Liana&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a long time, hasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell was pleasantly surprised. Ever since their parents moved to different areas, they never got to see each other again. And that little girl has grown up to be a beautiful woman, standing in front of him. Old childhood friends reuniting.</p></p>

<p><p>Both of them hugged. Then Liana went to Margrit, and they hugged.</p></p>

<p><p>Kemia: &ldquo;This sure is touching, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus: &ldquo;Indeed. I am glad Jeremiah has been blessed with such wonderful children.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Oh yes, speaking of my father&#8230;Coitus, you&rsquo;re a former member of the Elite Four, correct?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus: &ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ve been fighting alongside your father for over 20 years.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;I need you to do me a favor.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Anything.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Coitus, you have the most influence here. I want you to call up all the important leaders of the Rebel Faction. I have an announcement I&rsquo;d like to make.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;An announcement?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus was surprised, and so was Margarita, along with everyone else.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: (What exactly is his master plan?)</p></p>

<p><p>Indeed, what is Jerrell planning to do?</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="18">18: Home, Bitter Home. Jerrell's Master Plan. </span></p></center>


<p> <p>The wind blew hard in the desert like terrain. The buildings of the city were pretty much made of stone, they were very old but solid. Sayans have always been a barbaric race, never really keeping up with technology. But years ago, they saw the need for such technology, knowing that if they don&rsquo;t keep up with the times, they will lose out to other races.</p></p>

<p><p>They&rsquo;ve adopted scouters, spaceships, and other convenient technology, but they never really bothered with buildings. After all, why build something that might be destroyed anyway? The buildings were just primitive round towers, some with their own styles.</p></p>

<p><p>And inside one such round tower, Sephia grumbled about her most recent loss.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sephia, what happened over at T-5?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Nothing, brother. Do not worry, I will take care of it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta was not happy with that answer. &ldquo;Nimbus was unwilling to tell me anything. Now that he&rsquo;s headed for another planet, I can&rsquo;t ask him anything. And you just came back from T-5, and you are not willing to tell me anything.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I still have not found out who defeated Nimbus. It&rsquo;s all her fault. Grrr&#8230;that damned Margarita.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Margarita?&rdquo; Vegeta repeated.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, that stupid bitch. I swear, next time, I will get her.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta: (She sounds familiar&#8230;could she be&#8230;<strong>that</strong> Margarita? The daughter of Jeremiah Florence? But I thought they were dead?)</p></p>

<p><p>As per Jerrell&rsquo;s request, Coitus called all the important leaders within the area. They all gathered together, sitting with each other on a long table, with Jerrell at the head. Directly next to him was Coitus, and opposite of Coitus was Margarita and Malin. Liana was next to Kemia, and opposite of Kemia was Kanus. In total, about twenty important people were there.</p></p>

<p><p>Kanus: &ldquo;Young man, care to explain the meaning of this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Very well, let us start. I apologize for the short notice, ladies and gentlemen. But we are all leaders and important figures in the Great War. But before I get to the main agenda, I&rsquo;d like to introduce myself. Most of you have met me already. My name is <strong>Jerrell Florencia</strong>&#8230;son of Jeremiah Florencia, the man who was known for starting the Elite Four. And unfortunately, the Elite Four is no longer. And neither is my father. He was killed in front of our very eyes. My sister and I have been through a lot. And I know all of you have too.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus: &ldquo;Indeed. We grieve deeply for your father. He was a great man. But we are glad you&rsquo;re back with us.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kanus: &ldquo;Heh, have you finally decided to stop hiding and come back to fight with us?&rdquo; No one paid attention to his comment.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Because of the conditions back then, my sister and I had to flee to a neutral planet. We were just kids back then. But while on T-5, planet Ruskus, I kept up to date with what&rsquo;s happening with the war. I contacted Coitus all the time. And I can tell we are losing badly.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kanus: &ldquo;Heh, like we need you to tell us that. Tell us something we don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus: &ldquo;My theory is that someone amongst us is a traitor. There&rsquo;s a high possibility. Somehow, the enemy has always been able to anticipate our every move. They know where we are going to go.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all Vegeta&rsquo;s fault! He killed my father. He killed many Rebels. I&rsquo;ll kill that bastard with my own hands.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;Please, calm down. We all feel the same as you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Liana: &ldquo;This is war, after all. There isn&rsquo;t a single one of us, I bet, who hasn&rsquo;t lost a loved one, or knows someone who lost a loved one.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;After reviewing many strategies for this war, I come to the conclusion that our chances of winning are slim. I&rsquo;m sorry to say it. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve proposed a new solution &ndash; it&rsquo;s my master plan. We will start a colony on a neutral planet, and build our forces from there. It will be brilliant &ndash; the Loyalists won&rsquo;t suspect a thing. We&rsquo;ll train our forces on the colony and make them strong. And then one day we will bring a whole army back here to fight them.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Everyone had mixed reactions. But tension was in the air.</p></p>

<p><p>Kemia: &ldquo;A colony?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kanus: &ldquo;Young man, please tell me you are not serious?! Is this some kind of sick joke?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Oh no, I assure you, it is no joke, gentlemen. I&rsquo;ve thought about this for some time now.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kanus: &ldquo;This is your &lsquo;master plan&rsquo;? It&rsquo;s preposterous!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kemia: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I have to agree with Kanus on this one. It is farfetched.&rdquo; <br>  Liana: &ldquo;Please, gentlemen, at least let him finish.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;I know you all have your concerns. But our forces are weak on Mesatomia. We need a solid, strong base to train our troops! The Loyalists have that &ndash; and we do not. That&rsquo;s our greatest weakness. I propose that we move our forces to planet Masucs &ndash; an uninhibited colony &ndash; safe from the war. No one in the Empire will know this location except for us.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: (Start a colony and build it from scratch? This is brother&rsquo;s master plan? This is what he has been thinking about for a day in his room? Has he planned out everything in detail?)</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus: &ldquo;Young man, I must say&#8230;you certainly are ambitious for making such a proposal.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kanus: &ldquo;Ambition isn&rsquo;t always a good thing. This young lad clearly doesn&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s saying! You must be mad. How is your plan going to help us win the war?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Liana: &ldquo;Mr. Kanus, please. We have to be open minded. Nothing we have done has worked so far. So why not give him a chance?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Liana, thank you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;I trust Jerrell. I&rsquo;m going to agree with it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Naturally, I am going to follow him.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus: &ldquo;Jerrell, you certainly are your father&rsquo;s son. You have his ambitions. Your father has never let us down before. Mr. Kanus, I&rsquo;ve contacted Jerrell often when he was on Ruskus. And I can tell he&rsquo;s a brilliant strategist. Can you reconsider?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kanus banged the table. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to be kidding me. I won&rsquo;t go with such a preposterous plan. You can&rsquo;t just come out of no where and tell us what to do! Your plan is going to fail miserably!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kemia: &ldquo;Kanus, please. I disagree with Jerrell as well. But we must show respect.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Everything we&rsquo;ve done so far has failed. It&rsquo;s better than being hunted down like dogs! Those Loyalists &ndash; they don&rsquo;t consider this a war &ndash; but an extermination. Our pride is at sake &ndash; along with our lives!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kanus stood up. &ldquo;So after all your years of hiding, you just come here and tell us to go and hide? To take the coward&rsquo;s way?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s better than fighting a futile war! What you&rsquo;ve done so far only made us lose!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kanus: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an idiot &ndash; just like your father!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Liana: &ldquo;<strong>Mr. Kanus! Please! Do you know what you&rsquo;re saying?&rdquo;</strong></p></p>

<p><p>Kanus was overly frustrated, and he left the room, slamming the door in the process. Kemia went after him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, people. He&rsquo;s got a temper like that.&rdquo; he said before leaving.</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus: &ldquo;Jerrell, I apologize for his behavior.-&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Mr. Coitus. I understand not everyone will agree. But those who do, we will begin immediately. Let&rsquo;s not waste any time.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kanus stood at the edge of a cliff, staring down at the Rebel camp. The dry wind blew hard. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe those fools &ndash; they&rsquo;re so gullible. What&rsquo;s the big deal about Jerrell anyway? He&rsquo;s just another hot shot who thinks he knows it all.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kemia appeared. &ldquo;Kanus&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; he said rudely.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Nothing&#8230;I just want to see how you&rsquo;re feeling.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I feel like shit, if you must know.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I know how you feel, Kanus. I know you better than anyone. Your blood is probably boiling right now. But you were pretty rude to that kid.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Peh. The only reason they listen to Jerrell is because of Jeremiah&rsquo;s reputation.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;And the only reason people respect you is because of <strong>your</strong> father&rsquo;s reputation. Right?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmph.&rdquo; Kanus replied, not wanting to hear the truth. &ldquo;Whatever. I don&rsquo;t want to hear anymore.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Okay, fine.&rdquo; Kemia said, shrugging. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave you alone. But as you stand here and think&#8230;think about what kind of future we have with this war. No one has any fresh ideas&#8230;until that young lad came in. Of course they&rsquo;ll be willing to listen to him. Well, see ya.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Standing at the camp, Jerrell was making his preparations. He and Coitus were examining some paperwork.</p></p>

<p><p>Liana saw them, and approached slowly. &ldquo;Ummm, Jerrell?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Liana? What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You got a moment?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sure thing.&rdquo; They stepped aside.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I want to umm&#8230;apologize for Kanus&rsquo;s rude behavior. He&rsquo;s got a bad temper. He&rsquo;s actually known for it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright. I&rsquo;m not offended&#8230;not that much anyway.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ummm, yeah, that&rsquo;s all I wanted to say.&rdquo; she said, brushing her feet against the sand. Her eyes kept looking up and down, as if afraid to make contact with his eyes. &ldquo;By the way&#8230;I think your idea is&#8230;very smart. It&rsquo;s very big. I like it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Uhhh&#8230;thanks.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well&#8230;ummm&#8230;good luck!&rdquo; she said, smiling, and ran off.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell wondered what that was about. But his thoughts ceased when Coitus called him back.</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita was standing on the roof of a tower, staring at the camp below. The wind was dry, just like the desert. Occasionally, a sandstorm may approach, and one can&rsquo;t see in such a situation. It&rsquo;s best to stay indoors during heavy storms. But even at regular times, the wind always carries sand with it, and the air is hardly clean. Margrit didn&rsquo;t like this air. It gave her a strange, sick feeling.</p></p>

<p><p>Malin joined her. &ldquo;So&#8230;we&rsquo;re finally back home. Home sweet home, eh?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;More like home, bitter home.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to like about Mesatomia. I have only bad memories. The air here is so&#8230;foul. It makes me sick.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin wasn&rsquo;t sure if she was talking about the actual air, or the fact that many people died here, and the air is foul because of it. Maybe she meant both.</p></p>

<p><p>As everyone was focused on carrying out Jerrell&rsquo;s plans, a space pod approached the camp at high speed.</p></p>

<p><p>One of the troops rushed out and went to Coitus. &ldquo;Sir! We have a flying object approaching us!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus and Jerrell immediately went to the computer. Beep. Beep.</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus: &ldquo;Only one?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>S-Soldier: &ldquo;Shall we fire at it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus: &ldquo;Is it an enemy&#8230;or an ally?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;An enemy won&rsquo;t send just one pod.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, a face appeared on the screen. The man&rsquo;s head was bleeding, and his face was dirty. The screen was shaking as he spoke. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Rebel officer! I need help!! Requesting permission to land!!&rdquo; yelled Blaze.</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s one of us! Let him land!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The soldiers at the front put down their guns, and the pod went past them, making a strong wind. Frooom. The soldiers winced. The pod smashed into the ground, and skidded a while before coming to a full stop. Smoke came out.</p></p>

<p><p>The troops rushed to the scene. Margrit and Malin saw what happened from the roof. Jerrell, Coitus, and Liana went close to the pod. Blaze stepped out, and he was bleeding on the forehead and leg. &ldquo;Ugh&#8230;&rdquo; He took a step, then collapsed.</p></p>

<p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus: &ldquo;Get the medics!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Blaze woke up and sat up, gasping. &ldquo;Ahh&#8230;where am I?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell and Coitus were standing next to his bed, while Liana stood outside of the door, leaning against it, and she could hear everything.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; he repeated.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Relax, lad.&rdquo; Coitus replied. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re safe in my base. I am Coitus of the group known as Elite Four. You&rsquo;re in our main camp of the <strong>First Division</strong>. I am one of the commanders in charge here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;And I am Jerrell Florencia.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Blaze rubbed his head. &ldquo;Thank you for rescuing me. I am <strong>Blaze Mercia</strong> of the <strong>Fourth Division</strong>.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus had an instant reaction. &ldquo;The Fourth Division?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What happened to you?&rdquo; Jerrell asked. &ldquo;Your space pod was flying here at least 200 miles per hour. And then it crashed, almost hitting one of our tents. And you come out, injured. Where did you come from?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long story.&rdquo; Blaze answered.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re from the Fourth Division.&rdquo; said Coitus. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard about what happened. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My allies&#8230;were all killed.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;And I was still not strong enough&#8230;damn it&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who did this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Blaze: &ldquo;That bastard&#8230;he was really strong. I think his name was <strong>Gusher</strong>.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Gusher?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus: &ldquo;Never heard of him.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Blaze: &ldquo;Neither have I. But I&rsquo;ll get him back one of these days.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p><strong>Brockus </strong>stepped into the room. &ldquo;General, when will we make our next attack?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Soon.&rdquo; answered Vegeta. &ldquo;Very soon.&rdquo;</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="19">19: The Sight Of War. 
</span></p></center>

<p> <p>Vegeta was typing on the computer, and in front of him were three chambers &ndash; with androids inside. They were currently being developed, and incomplete.</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia came in without knocking, as usual. &ldquo;Brother, are you still working on those androids?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes. What is it? Is it important?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I just want to tell you that his highness King Neflite is growing impatient. He wants the First Division eliminated.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta: &ldquo;It takes time to fight a war.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It also takes time to lose one.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, that is all. Why bother with androids, brother? They&rsquo;re just lifeless things.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Lifeless fighting slaves. With the right tools and programming, I can make the strongest warrior in the universe! He&rsquo;ll be able to defeat anyone.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;True warriors are born, not created.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the other way around.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Whatever.&rdquo; Sephia said, and left.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;All my allies&#8230;the whole Fourth Division was killed&#8230;&rdquo; Blaze said. &ldquo;They were murdered brutally.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;By who?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;A mercenary by the name of Gusher.&rdquo; Blaze answered.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Gusher? He took out a whole division&#8230;by himself?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Blaze&rsquo;s fists grabbed the blanket and squeezed it tight. &ldquo;It was all my fault. I wasn&rsquo;t strong enough. Grrrr. Why am I never strong enough?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Is this mercenary a sayan?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Blaze: &ldquo;I have no information on him. He just showed up out of nowhere and attacked us. We were unprepared.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Leaning against the wall, and listening outside was Liana. (The Fourth Division, huh? I&rsquo;ve heard some pretty disturbing news about the tragedy&#8230;)</p></p>

<p><p>Dead bodies lay on the floor, in a dark room. Blaze is the only one left standing, and he&rsquo;s bleeding and groaning. The mercenary warrior just finished blasting them. He laughed as his hand is smoking from the energy.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that there is someone that strong out there.&rdquo; Blaze said. &ldquo;We never should have gone to the Land of the Dead.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;The Land of the Dead. I&rsquo;ve heard many disturbing things about that place.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus: &ldquo;All you need to know is that it&rsquo;s a place you should never go to, unless you want to commit suicide.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Blaze got up. &ldquo;What a joke&#8230;here I am&#8230;one of the strongest warriors of all time, defeated by a mere mercenary. I can&rsquo;t even defeat him. What does that make me?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright. We all win and lose.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not okay!&rdquo; he hollered back, which surprised Coitus a bit. &ldquo;I still have my grudge match against Dark Spectre.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Dark Spectre? The supreme commander of the Dark Empire?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Blaze: &ldquo;Yes! I fought him three years ago. I will never forget that day.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Both Coitus and Jerrell were surprised, and so was Liana, but she didn&rsquo;t show any reaction. &ldquo;You fought him and lived?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Blaze: &ldquo;I still remember that day like it was yesterday.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Your judgment day has come, Spectre!&rdquo; Blaze yelled.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You broke into my palace and killed my guards, hoping to kill me? You&rsquo;re either very strong, or very stupid. And I think it&rsquo;s the latter.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of hearing your name! After I kill you, I&rsquo;ll be the one who will be known as the strongest man in the cosmos!&rdquo; He powered up.</p></p>

<p><p>They had an explosive fight, but in the end, the winner was obvious. Spectre&rsquo;s dark energy overwhelmed Blaze, and he was blasted away.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aaaaahhh!!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kabooom! Spectre watched the fireworks enjoyably.</p></p>

<p><p>He thought that Blaze died from the explosive. But he didn&rsquo;t, either due to sheer luck, or his strength.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Damn it.&rdquo; Blaze said, banging his fist on the table, cracking it. &ldquo;I was so close. But he made a fool of me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus: &ldquo;I see. So you&rsquo;re the famed warrior who fought and survived with Dark Spectre.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been training hard ever since that day. I swore I&rsquo;d get him. But now I lost to a Muraian mercenary. What a joke fate has played on me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: (What an arrogant fool. He&rsquo;s lucky to have survived. Who&rsquo;d challenge someone like Dark Spectre to a fight <strong>alone</strong>? His recklessness can be a danger to our cause. But he&rsquo;s strong headed and powerful. His desire for revenge is strong.)</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get him one of these days. Mark my words, you bastard.&rdquo; Blaze said, looking up, as if staring at Spectre&rsquo;s face directly.</p></p>

<p><p>Liana has heard enough, and walked away.</p></p>

<p><p>While waling out of the tent, Jerrell and Coitus talked about their new guest.</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus: &ldquo;Man&#8230;that guy sure is intense.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trust him. There&rsquo;s something about him I just don&rsquo;t like.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He might be an inspiration to the Rebel Faction.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmph. Probably.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Meanwhile, Margrit and Malin were still on the roof, and they just finished talking about how bad Mesatomia is.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh, I can&rsquo;t stand this place anymore. I&rsquo;m leaving.&rdquo; Margrit said, and took flight.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wait! Where are you going?&rdquo; Malin shouted.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;To get some fresh air!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin took flight. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not supposed to wander off too far. Otherwise we&rsquo;ll be in danger.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who cares about the rules? What can possibly happen to us?&rdquo; Margrit said, and speeds up.</p></p>

<p><p>Malin speeds up as well. &ldquo;Hey, stop! I&rsquo;m serious.&rdquo; She grabbed Margrit&rsquo;s leg.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let go!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Why are you so irritable today?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;None of your business.&rdquo; Margrit continued flying.</p></p>

<p><p>As they flew by, they were detected by Loyalist&rsquo;s scouters.</p></p>

<p><p>Beep beep.</p></p>

<p><p>Soldier A: &ldquo;Well, what do we have here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Soldier B: &ldquo;Rebels. Only two of them?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A: &ldquo;They strayed from the camp. Let&rsquo;s have ourselves a little hunting game, shall we?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>B: &ldquo;Yes. We haven&rsquo;t had Rebel blood for a while.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>While flying, energy beams flew in Margrit&rsquo;s direction, she dodged them. &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; Suddenly one of them hit her, and she fell.</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She was falling and falling, and still barely conscious, and suddenly, she woke up &ndash; Crash!! Fell into a boulder.</p></p>

<p><p>Four soldiers surrounded the boulder.</p></p>

<p><p>Someone hit Malin in the back, and she was caught off guard. &ldquo;Agh!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A and B came from the side, and released their energies, and she couldn&rsquo;t move. She was stuck in between their spiritual barriers. Soldier C appeared in front of Malin, and gathered energy into his fist.</p></p>

<p><p>C: &ldquo;Well, lookit what we have here? Two wandering Rebels?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;Hey, let go!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>C: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s such a shame, really, that you have to die so young. But don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ll send yours corpse back to the camp as a warning.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>[Close up - Malin]. &ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>As the four warriors on the ground got closer to the boulder, Margrit stood up, and screamed as she powered up. &ldquo;AAAAHHH!!&rdquo; Bang! The shockwave had the soldiers startled.</p></p>

<p><p>[Close up &ndash; Margrit]. &ldquo;You want a piece of me? Then come and get it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The four soldiers leaped at her, with their energy balls. Kaboom!</p></p>

<p><p>Malin, still trapped, powered up, knocking A and B away. C fired his charged up beam, and Malin blurred. She appeared behind him and hit him on the back. Whack!!</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you get for sneaking up behind someone.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>C kept falling until he crashed into the valley wall. Crash.</p></p>

<p><p>More Loyalists soldiers came to the scene.</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;Now look what you&rsquo;ve started?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Me? They attacked me first!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They quickly got into fighting position.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, one of the rebel&rsquo;s scouters beeped. &ldquo;Hmm, what&rsquo;s this? A fight nearby?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>X: &ldquo;We better inform Mr. Coitus.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>While Liana was sitting somewhere, polishing her gun, her scouter beeped. &ldquo;What? What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>While Coitus and Jerrell were talking, X and Y came to them. &ldquo;Sir, we have urgent news. We detected a battle nearby!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus: &ldquo;What?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;The Loyalists&#8230;they&rsquo;re on to us.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kaboom! The ground exploded. Margrit came out of the smoke and attacked the soldiers. They were beaten quickly. Pow! Wham! Whack! Kapow!</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aaaah!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kapow! Margrit punched a guy in the face, knocking him down. Then she elbowed someone in the stomach, then grabbed him and threw him at two other guys. Then she blasted them. Boom.</p></p>

<p><p>Blood splattered.</p></p>

<p><p>Standing on a tall, vertical piece of mountain, a column, a warrior in a white cape was meditating. He sensed some energies rising nearby, and he opened his eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So&#8230;it&rsquo;s time for bloodshed already?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit breathed hard. She didn&rsquo;t know there was blood on her face. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon&#8230;is that all you&rsquo;ve got? Is this what you Loyalists are capable of?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Three troops wanted to attack, but they were frozen with fear. She approached step by step.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Is this what I came back here for? You Loyalists are nothing but dogs!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>E: &ldquo;Hey, watch what you say, Rebel scum!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; She fired a beam, and he was destroyed.</p></p>

<p><p>The other two flew at her. Kapow! She punched F, knocking him against the wall.</p></p>

<p><p>G stopped, and ran away.</p></p>

<p><p>F, now trapped, was shaking nervously. &ldquo;Just who do you think you are?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I am Margarita Florencia!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Florencia?&rdquo; he said with shock. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re&#8230;you&rsquo;re the daughter of&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Blam! She blew off his head. The headless body fell, and blood squirted from its neck.</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;Hey, are you alright?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Yeah. I guess the coast is clear.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin turned around. &ldquo;Uhhh, not quite.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A whole group of troops were staring at them angrily.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, a bunch of beams hit the ground, blowing up the Loyalists.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell, Coitus, Liana, and Kemia came to finish the job.</p></p>

<p><p><strong>Boom! </strong>Coitus fired beams long distance, blowing up soldiers, and making smoke to cover their vision.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell produced electric fields and electrified the poor suckers.</p></p>

<p><p>Wham! Pow! Liana gave them a whooping with her moves. Malin broke their necks with her high speed kicks.</p></p>

<p><p>As a result, four of the Loyalists were tied up, sitting on the ground, nervously awaiting their fate.</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;Mr. Coitus, thank you for coming to our aide. We thought we were done for.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus: &ldquo;No problem.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell went to her sister. &ldquo;Margarita, what&rsquo;s wrong with you? Why did you run off like that? We told you to leave the camp&rsquo;s territory! You could&rsquo;ve gotten yourself and Malin killed!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit just stared at him, not saying a word.</p></p>

<p><p>Liana stepped in front, and tried to stop him, pushing passively. &ldquo;Now, now, Jerrell, you shouldn&rsquo;t yell at your sister like that. It&rsquo;s her first experience with war. Besides, thanks to her, we discovered that the enemy is spying on us. Now they&rsquo;ll think twice before doing stupid things like that.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Stop trying to help her. Margarita has always been reckless.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit walked over to one of the captured, H. They watched her curiously. She grabbed H by the collar. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re a Loyalist sergeant, right?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Sis, what are you doing now?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>H: &ldquo;Yeah&#8230;I am.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; She tossed him on the ground and untied him.</p></p>

<p><p>[Split screen horizontal &ndash; 4] &ndash; [Malin, Kemia, Jerrell, Coitus].</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;What do you think you&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;I want you to send a message to your leader. Tell your leader, whoever he is&#8230;to bring it on!! We Rebels are not weak like you think we are. You Loyalists are weak and pathetic, and you will never, ever win in a fair fight. Our camp is strong. Whatever you&rsquo;ve got, we&rsquo;ve got better. Now go!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>H took a step back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll deliver the message. But you&rsquo;ll regret this, sayan.&rdquo; He flew away.</p></p>

<p><p>Everyone was shocked by her actions.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell slapped himself on the forehead. &ldquo;Oh great! She just provoked the enemy.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kemia: &ldquo;Very daring, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus, however, smiled. &ldquo;Well, I must say, I am quite surprised. She sure knows how to issue a challenge.&rdquo;<br>  Liana couldn&rsquo;t agree more. &ldquo;Indeed. The enemy has been threatening us all this time. Whether we provoke them or not, they are going to attack us. They&rsquo;ve insulted us time after time, but it&rsquo;s about time <strong>we</strong> threw the insults.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit was indifferent to their opinions. She just stared at the dead gray sky, lusting for revenge. So, this is what war is like, huh? she thought. Then I won&rsquo;t lose, no matter what.</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="20">20: Attack On The Camp. 
</span></p></center>

<p> <p>Soldier H kneeled in front of Vegeta.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said the angry general. &ldquo;That is what the Rebels said to us?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes sir.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Very well then. You may go.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; H left the room.</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta: &ldquo;So, the Rebels think they can make a fool of me, do they?&rdquo; He walked over to the balcony, and stepped at the very edge, near the fence. The wind was mild and cool, and his cape blew from the wind. He always wore the red cape with the &ldquo;L&rdquo; symbol on it &ndash; red signifies victory and power. And also blood.</p></p>

<p><p>(Those damned Rebels dare say such a thing to me? Then it&rsquo;s time I make one last attack, this next battle will be bigger than the previous one. Coitus, you old fool, you are going down. And then the Elite Four will be no more, just a mere memory. And I shall destroy the First Division once and for all.)</p></p>

<p><p>Brockus and his companion, <strong>Amistad</strong>, were observing the enemy camp. They had their arms crossed, and smiled evilly.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell and Coitus were analyzing their plans in one of the tents. A map was spread out on the table, and a candle light was placed on the map.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is where we will be going to.&rdquo; Jerrell said, pointing at the dot on the map. &ldquo;Planet Mascus. It&rsquo;s not inhibited by any species, so it&rsquo;s ours for the taking.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But what about resources? We will need to deliver them from here. It will be costly in time and money.&rdquo; Coitus commented.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about food and other natural resources, Mascus has plenty. I&rsquo;ve done my research. But as far as the construction of the colony, yes, we will need them. And we also need soldiers. Lots of them.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But not everyone agrees with your plan, Jerrell.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I know. Kanus and Kemia disagree. If they want to continue fighting, then so be it. But I need as many soldiers as possible.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;Jerrell&#8230;I will do anything for you. Your father helped us out a great deal. But I myself cannot come to your colony, I hope you understand. I still have to fight this war. Even if we are losing, we have to fight to the very end. That&rsquo;s the sayan way.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I understand, Mr. Coitus. But what we lack is unification. That is the purpose of this colony. Just give me a few years; I swear I will produce a great army. Then we will take the Loyalists by surprise. They won&rsquo;t know what hit them.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Crickets were heard outside. Liana was by herself, as usual, cleaning her gun with a towel. Then she saw Margarita on the roof, sitting there. Liana blurred and appeared next to Margrit.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t sleep?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; replied Margrit.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Same here.&rdquo; Liana said. Then silence. &ldquo;What you did the other day&#8230;was pretty&#8230;ummm, surprising.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit looked at her. &ldquo;Ya think so?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You know what&rsquo;s more surprising? The fact that we have a traitor among us. The other day, during the meeting, Coitus mentioned that there could be a traitor among us. Have any idea who this person can be?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Uhhh, I dunno. It could be anyone.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Anyone. This traitor is a scumbag. A disgrace to our cause. Don&rsquo;t ya think so?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ehhh, yeah.&rdquo; Liana replied. &ldquo;Definitely.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta, Jarus, and Sephia stood on the top of a cliff. &ldquo;Now, Jarus, let me show you how to fight a war. Let the operation commence!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia: &ldquo;Yes, right away.&rdquo; Then she spoke to her scouter. &ldquo;All teams, attack now!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta: &ldquo;Watch and learn. By dawn, victory will be mine.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jarus: &ldquo;Hmmm&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia: &ldquo;Brother, may I fight too?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sure, go ahead.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She flew down to the valley. Froooom.</p></p>

<p><p>A soldier on duty was falling asleep, until his scouter beeped. &ldquo;Huh? What&rsquo;s this? Five signals detected? No, ten&#8230;no fifteen&#8230;thirty!!&rdquo; Now he was getting scared. &ldquo;Oh no&#8230;it&rsquo;s an invasion! Everyone, wake up! We&rsquo;re under attack!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kaboom! The soldier was no longer in sight.</p></p>

<p><p>The alarm sounded.</p></p>

<p><p>Liana: &ldquo;An attack! Damn it, why do they always attack us at night? Margarita, I am going to the front lines. You stay behind for backup!&rdquo; She took off.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Stay behind for backup? No way.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Then, Malin showed up. &ldquo;You heard the alarm?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You bet. Let&rsquo;s get to work.&rdquo; Margrit said, putting on her gloves.</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus and Jerrell heard the signal, and so did Kanus and Kemia.</p></p>

<p><p>Before anyone knew what happened, things started blowing up. Rebels and Loyalists started firing with guns and beams. Explosions occurred in the sky and on land.</p></p>

<p><p>As Vegeta and Jarus were watching from the cliff, there were operators behind them, checking the status of the battle. The operators kneeled on the ground, listened to their scouters and their tracking computers.</p></p>

<p><p>Operator A: &ldquo;The battle has commenced!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta: &ldquo;Excellent. Release the androids!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Disobeying Liana, Margarita and Malin strayed off. They weren&rsquo;t familiar with the camp, so they went to a place they didn&rsquo;t recognize. But they saw explosions in the air. <strong>Boom, boom</strong>.</p></p>

<p><p>The two flew up to the air and hit the Loyalists &ndash; they attacked any random enemy nearby &ndash; that&rsquo;s how battles were fought, pretty much. Kabam! Boom!!</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Hyah! Hyuh!&rdquo; Kapow! She knocked a soldier away. Then she fired a beam, blowing up a few of them.</p></p>

<p><p>Malin fired her Multi-directional Blast, killing several at a time. Bam!</p></p>

<p><p>Soldiers fell off the sky like flies.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Come on!!&rdquo; yelled the angry sayan, &ldquo;Is that all you&rsquo;ve got?&rdquo; She said, firing a beam.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, a soldier charged and hit her in the stomach. She grunted in pain, and held her stomach tightly, but she was just pretending. Kapow! She punched the soldier into the mountain wall. Wham.</p></p>

<p><p>A beam hit her on the back. Margrit turned around and fired at the guy who fired at her. And he was fried, and fell to the ground.</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;Margarita! Be careful!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, as Margrit looked up, a beam hit her and knocked her down. Malin flew down to her friend&rsquo;s aide.</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;You alright?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Margrit said, patting the dust off herself.</p></p>

<p><p>Kaboom! The ground between them exploded, and dust covered the area. Margrit coughed. &ldquo;Malin? Where are you?&rdquo; She saw a silhouetted figure in the dust, and thought it was Malin. But as the silhouetted figure revealed itself, it&rsquo;s not a woman. It was man, dressed in a green army uniform, with sunglasses and a cap.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who the hell are you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Not saying anything, the android attacked. Doosh! Margrit blocked its punch, then pushed it back with sheer force, then punched the android&rsquo;s face. Whack! Its glasses fell, revealing its robotic eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;What? An android?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kaboom! Kemia jumped away from an explosion. &ldquo;Kanus, I am going to the front lines. You stay here and lead the reinforcements!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kanus: &ldquo;Alright!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kemia flew away.</p></p>

<p><p>Kanus continued killing Loyalists. Doosh! Wham! Whack! The bodies kept on adding up. &ldquo;Heh. Worthless Loyalists. I don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s the fuss with them?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Android A-2 landed behind him, and he turned around. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A-2 fired a blast, Kanus jumped away and landed in a crouch. (He seems better than the others. Is he a commander?)</p></p>

<p><p>Meanwhile, Vegeta and Jarus monitored the current battle status.</p></p>

<p><p>Operator A: &ldquo;Team one is attacking the front lines. They&rsquo;re breaking through.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Operator C: &ldquo;Team three is wiping out their foes with no problem!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Operator D: &ldquo;Team four has penetrated the enemy.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta smiled wickedly, knowing everything is going according to plan. &ldquo;You see, Jarus? This is how you lead an army to victory.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jarus: &ldquo;Hmph. Quit bragging.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zzzzzzt! &ldquo;Aaaagh!&rdquo; screamed the soldier, as he was being strangled and zapped by Sephia. He was fried, and collapsed in front of her. She looked around, and there were a total of three dead bodies.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmph. How boring.&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;No one&rsquo;s even a challenge to me.&rdquo; Then, she saw something ahead. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; She soared up. &ldquo;Ohhh&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Below her were the tents of the camp.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So this is the main base of the camp. Ha ha ha ha ha! They didn&rsquo;t even bother protecting it.&rdquo; Sephia fired beams downwards, blowing things up.</p></p>

<p><p>Kemia shows up. &ldquo;Hey you, stop it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What? Watch your tongue, Rebel. You will address me with respect. My name is Sephia, Vegeta&rsquo;s sister.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Vegeta&rsquo;s sister? Peh, your kind is not welcome here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia: &ldquo;We should be the ones saying that. You people make our race &lsquo;impure.&rsquo; Sooner or later, we will get rid of your kind from our continent. Everyone will join the Empire sooner or later.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The Empire&rsquo;s evil, and so are you!&rdquo; He fired a beam. Blam.</p></p>

<p><p>She dodged. &ldquo;Hmph. Let me dispose of the trash.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Bam. Bam. She dodged some more, then ascended and fired a red beam. Kemia blocked it, but it pushed him down all the way to the ground, and made him half-buried. &ldquo;Ughhh!! Ahhh!&rdquo; he groaned, struggling to <strong>not</strong> get fried.</p></p>

<p><p>Boom. Kemia came out of the ground, coughing. His face was bleeding. Suddenly, Sephia kicked him in the chest. Doosh. She kept on hitting him, and he could barely defend himself. Pow. Kapow.</p></p>

<p><p>Kemia fell down. &ldquo;Ugh&#8230;ahhh&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh, how pathetic.&rdquo; Sephia said, putting her hands on her hips. &ldquo;And here I was, thinking that a so-called commander like you would actually pose a threat to me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Wham. Kanus was pushed back, with a hand on his chest. &ldquo;Damn android.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A-2 advanced, and opened its palms. Kanus winced and blocked. Boom.</p></p>

<p><p>Doosh. Kemia was kicked in the chest. He kept on coughing and moaning in pain.</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia raised her arm up and charged up a ball. &ldquo;Heh, your time has come, Rebel!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly a beam came from the side, destroying her ball, and another parallel beam came at her. She jumped up, and another beam hit her, and she landed in a crouch.</p></p>

<p><p>Liana: &ldquo;Kemia, get out of here now! I&rsquo;ll handle this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kemia nodded, then left.</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia smiled. &ldquo;More Rebel trash?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who you calling trash?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not seriously going to fight me, are you?&rdquo; Sephia said in a taunting way.</p></p>

<p><p>But Liana was in fighting position, knees bent, one hand up, the wrist blade facing forward.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Fine then, have it your way.&rdquo; Sephia charged.</p></p>

<p><p>They hit and exchanged moves. Whack! Sephia did a high kick, Liana blocked. Sephia followed up with some punches, Liana blocked, predicting her movements.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell just finished electrifying some of his foes. Suddenly, Brockus and Amistad showed up. Jerrell and them stared.</p></p>

<p><p>Brockus: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of this one.&rdquo; He flew down and attacked Jerrell.</p></p>

<p><p>As they hit, Amistad gathered energy, aiming at Jerrell. Suddenly, his scouter beeped, and saw a beam coming, and he dodged. Boom.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Grrr&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not nice to hit someone while they&rsquo;re off guard, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Amistad: &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter how we kill you, as long as we kill you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They fired streams and streams of energy at each other, making big bangs in the air.</p></p>

<p><p>The battle raged on. Soldiers were dying and others persisted.</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta and Jarus were still standing on the same spot.</p></p>

<p><p>Operator B: &ldquo;Sir, team two is losing units fast!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Team one is in trouble! They need assistance immediately!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Team three is under attack! They can&rsquo;t handle it the situation!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Vegeta said. &ldquo;How can this be&#8230;&rdquo; He started to sweat.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Team four is under attack by Coitus&rsquo;s men!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta was sweating more and more, and got nervous as the operators kept on reporting bad news.</p></p>

<p><p>Jarus: &ldquo;Heh, it looks like you underestimated the First Division, mighty general. What are you going to do now?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta grunted angrily. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! I am going down there.&rdquo; In a flash, he flew down to the valley.</p></p>

<p><p>Jarus: &ldquo;One person can&rsquo;t make a difference, no matter how good you are.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Troops from both sides saw a bright red comet flying. It was Vegeta and his ki. Froom!</p></p>

<p><p>Loyalists cheered for him. &ldquo;Vegeta! Go!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now that our General is here, we cannot lose.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Froom! He zoomed past Rebel troops, knocking them down. Wham! Wham! Another one down.</p></p>

<p><p>Soldiers were all over the sky, and the ground as well, and not a single spot was safe. Coitus was floating in the middle of his team. &ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s make this happen, men.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Men: <strong>&ldquo;Yes sir.&rdquo;</strong></p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Coitus&rsquo;s scouter beeped, detecting Vegeta. He saw a red comet smashing into soldiers at high speeds.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Can that be him?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta&rsquo;s rampage came to a stop when he saw Coitus, and the two did the stare. Coitus wasn&rsquo;t going to let this Loyalist do whatever he wants. He&rsquo;s going to show him his place.</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta: &ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t the infamous <strong>Tyranus</strong> Coitus.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t the infamous General Vegeta. I am afraid this little battle is about to end.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to end alright, but not in your favor.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had it with you people hunting us down like animals.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you <strong>are</strong> animals!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Pow! Coitus attacked recklessly, Vegeta blocked. &ldquo;Heh, you don&rsquo;t know the meaning of true power!&rdquo; He powered up, and his energy pushed Coitus away.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyranus&rsquo;s scouter beeped crazily, and he grew worried. Vegeta&rsquo;s power level was unbelievable.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So, the battle has started.&rdquo; said the nameless white-caped warrior. &ldquo;Vegeta is at it again. When will he learn?&rdquo;</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="21">21: Hardships Of War. 
</span></p></center>

<p> <p>The battle rages on &ndash; it&rsquo;s Margarita&rsquo;s first true experience with war &ndash; the first major battle on her home planet. But she never considered this dump her home planet, she never liked it in the first place. She and Malin, and Jerrell have been through a lot, just like other orphans of war. And everything they&rsquo;ve been through on Ruskus &ndash; Lotus&rsquo;s death, the burning of the village, and the death of Moku &ndash; have prepared them for the hardships of war.</p></p>

<p><p>Arriving at the camp, Jerrell immediately gathers all leaders of the First Division together to propose his master plan, and some of them agree with him. But they were thrown into battle immediately afterwards. Are they too young for these hardships?</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ahhh, it looks like a good hour to shed blood.&rdquo; said the nameless warrior. Although he&rsquo;s not officially a Rebel, he has helped them several times in the past, and some people remember him, while others do not even know he exists.</p></p>

<p><p>The very same kind man who saved Margarita and Jerrell when they were children is the same man who survived a few years in the Land of the Dead, a place were one goes to receive intense training. But as the name suggests &ndash; it is not an easy place to leave&#8230;alive.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This can&rsquo;t be&#8230;&rdquo; Coitus said in disbelief, looking at Vegeta&rsquo;s power level.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now you see how insignificant you are, Coitus?&rdquo; Vegeta said, powering up. He was full of red energy. &ldquo;Hyaaaahh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t scare me!&rdquo; He fired two beams. Bam, bam.</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta knocked them away, then charged forward and slammed him through the air. Froooom.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ughhh&#8230;&rdquo; he yelled as he was pushed past some soldiers. Wham. He was slammed to the wall.</p></p>

<p><p>Whack! Liana blocked Sephia&rsquo;s punch, then jumped back. Liana fired a beam, and Sephia made a shield.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not seriously going to fight me, are you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of taking orders from you. This ends now.&rdquo; Liana said, still in fighting stance.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh, I see. What a foolish decision you&rsquo;ve made.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had it working for you and Vegeta. I&rsquo;m tired of being a traitor.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Images of Liana sneaking out of the camp at night, and reporting to Vegeta.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The Second Division will be hiding in this area.&rdquo; she announced.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Good work.&rdquo; Vegeta complimented. &ldquo;No one saw you sneak out, right?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No. Not a soul.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Liana continued. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of working for you Loyalists. The Rebel Forces are losing because of me. I&rsquo;m the traitor. They&rsquo;ve always wondered why the enemy is able to predict their moves. They suspected there&rsquo;s a traitor. But they never suspected me, because I don&rsquo;t seem like the traitor type. Every time I hear that word, I feel so guilty my heart just gets this wretched feeling, and I can&rsquo;t get rid of it. I&rsquo;m tired of being forced to work for you. I&rsquo;m tired of being your little rat!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmph. So now you&rsquo;re a traitor to both the Rebels and Loyalists. What a fine mess you got yourself in, Liana. I&rsquo;m afraid your family line ends here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Liana powered up. &ldquo;I have other plans. Since your brother is here, I&rsquo;m going to kill you, and then your brother. Then no one will know I&rsquo;m a traitor.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha.&rdquo; laughed Sephia. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re one hell of an optimist. What makes you think you can get past me?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find out, won&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia charged forward, Liana dodged her punch, grabbed her arm, and threw her. Thud. Sephia got up.</p></p>

<p><p>Liana: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t underestimate the Rebels.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Grrr&#8230;little wretch.&rdquo; Sephia fired a beam &ndash; Liana jumped up. Boom. Suddenly, Sephia&rsquo;s knee was in her stomach.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh&#8230;&rdquo; She had an expression of surprise and pain on her face. Then she fell down.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh. Is that all your talk amounts up to?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Liana: (This is going to be harder than I thought. I have to be careful.)</p></p>

<p><p>Slash! Android A2 was chopped in half by Kanus&rsquo;s hand sword. &ldquo;Peh, just cheap junk. Is Vegeta planning to use androids to fight his wars?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Wham. Margrit was hit against the wall. A1 charged forward, and she got out of its way, and it punched the wall, making a big hole.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Back off!&rdquo; she yelled, flying backwards, and fired beams.</p></p>

<p><p>A1 blocked the beams and kept charging at her, and knocked her to the ground. She got up, and dodged some beams. <strong>Boom</strong>.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;And since when do Loyalists stoop so low&#8230;as to use androids to fight a war?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A1 appeared behind her, and knocked down. Thud. A1 landed. Margrit up, and powered up with white energy. She was thinking about many angry things, including her mother and father&rsquo;s death, the attack on Memphis Village, and many other things the Loyalists have done to her. She just snapped and went out of control.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Damn you!!&rdquo; She blocked a beam. &ldquo;Fucking Loyalists! Can&rsquo;t you fight like real soldiers!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A1 appeared above her, and punched, Margrit blurred. Its energy-filled knuckle smashed the ground.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;I am a sayan warrior! How dare you disgrace me by sending this thing to fight me!!&rdquo; Doosh. Doosh. She blocked a punch. &ldquo;How dare you!!&rdquo; She did the Power Punch and hit A1&rsquo;s face, smashing its head into pieces. Then she kicked its body away. Margrit breathed hard. Then she sensed Liana and another familiar presence. &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia unleashed a furious combo on Liana, and she was bruised up all over. She breathed hard, thinking of a way to retaliate.</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia: &ldquo;Heh, what&rsquo;s the matter? Where&rsquo;s all your tough talk now, Liana?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Margarita appeared from the cliff, and she jumped down.</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia: (It&rsquo;s her! Margarita.)</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Liana? You okay?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Liana: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been better.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit stared at Sephia. &ldquo;Liana, go. I&rsquo;ll handle this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Liana: &ldquo;Are you sure? She&rsquo;s pretty tough.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I got it. Just go.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Liana flew up, and Sephia aimed her palm at her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not getting away.&rdquo; Suddenly, Margrit appeared in front of her, blocking her aim.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Not so fast, Ms. Sephia. It&rsquo;s been a while.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Nice to see you again, Ms. Margarita&#8230;Florencia. So you finally decided to stop hiding in that wimpy planet and join the resistance?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmph. I hope you&rsquo;ve been reflecting on your defeat.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What defeat? You think you beat me in a little video game means defeating me? Dream on!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s fight for real, this time. And this time, I won&rsquo;t be so forgiving.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia smiled wickedly. &ldquo;Have it your way.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The two charged and started hitting hard.</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus punched, Vegeta dodged, and kicked him in the guts, then kicked him again, knocking him in the air. He charged and let out a series of punches at Coitus, lightning fast. Thud thud thud thud. Coitus couldn&rsquo;t even fight back.</p></p>

<p><p>Kapow. Frooom. Coitus landed against the wall.</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta: &ldquo;Now you see the gap between our strengths? Today, the Elite Four is annihilated completely.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus: &ldquo;You bastard&#8230;don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ve won. It&rsquo;s not over.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, but it is over for you, weakling.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;One day, you are going to get it, Vegeta. All those people that you&rsquo;ve killed&#8230;you&rsquo;ve killed many parents. And their children hold a grudge against you. One day&#8230;someone strong enough will rise up and put an end to your reign.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I shudder at the thought.&rdquo; Vegeta said sarcastically.</p></p>

<p><p>Doosh! They hit at the elbows, then jumped away. Margrit fired the Energy Blast, and Sephia fired the Dark Blast. Kaboom.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit went to the air, Sephia joined her. They exchanged moves lightning fast. Pak pak pak pak.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My dear Margarita, you should&rsquo;ve stayed at your pathetic little planet. Someone like you isn&rsquo;t meant for war.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmph. No matter where I go, I&rsquo;ll always be hunted down. Me and my brother Jerrell were hoping to find peace at Ruskus. We fled Arlia in order to avoid the war. But you people had to come here and bother us.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh, it&rsquo;s not my fault that you&rsquo;re a <strong>weakling.</strong>&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Weakling. That word again. The word that Margrit detests. &ldquo;Who&#8230;are you calling a weakling, weakling?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zoom! Margrit rushed and punched recklessly. She followed up with a kick to the face. Whack!</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How dare you scar my face&#8230;Rebel&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Your face should be the least of your concerns.&rdquo; Margrit blurred, appeared in front of her, and grabbed her neck, lifting her up. &ldquo;Now, if you don&rsquo;t want me to kill you, I want you to tell me something.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia was gasping for breath, her hands were grabbing Margrit&rsquo;s arm.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I want you to tell me&#8230;the secret of dark energy.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>One of Sephia&rsquo;s eyes opened. &ldquo;Dark energy? Why do you need to know?&rdquo; she asked, smiling.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit strengthened her grip, Sephia gasped.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Just tell me. I know this is the Empire&rsquo;s main asset. Their dark energy&#8230;it is the key to their power. But I need to know what exactly it is, and how to produce it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t play with me.&rdquo; Suddenly, Margrit sensed a presence nearby &ndash; a deadly presence. Vegeta. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s him&#8230;&rdquo; She never forgot what this presence felt like &ndash; the man who killed her father. She swore she&rsquo;d remember his name and face, and his presence as well. &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t have time to play with you.&rdquo; She threw Sephia down the cliff, into the darkness.</p></p>

<p><p>Amistad charged forward, gathering energy into his palm, and Malin did a roundhouse kick, knocking him away. It was a good one. Amistad couldn&rsquo;t get up afterwards.</p></p>

<p><p>Likewise, as Brockus made his assault on Jerrell, Jerrell charged up and electrified him. Zzzzzzzt!</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aaaagh! You bastard!&rdquo; Brockus yelled, and fell down.</p></p>

<p><p>Malin and Jerrell met up in the air. &ldquo;Malin. This is chaotic.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tell me about it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Have you seen Margarita?&rdquo;<br>  &ldquo;I <strong>was</strong> with her, but we got separated.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We gotta find her. She&rsquo;s never fought a battle like this before.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;Jerrell, Margrit is not a little girl anymore. I know you want to protect her, but she&rsquo;s growing up. She is a fine sayan.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>There was truth to Malin&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;Yeah&#8230;but we still have to group up.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Blaze stood in a cliff, watching the battle continue. The explosions looked like bright circles in the sky. Suddenly, he sensed Vegeta and Coitus.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now is my chance to prove myself.&rdquo; He flew down, thinking about something that happened earlier. One of the Rebels told him to retreat with the backup forces, since he&rsquo;s injured. But Blaze refused. No one tells me what to do, he thought at that moment.</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta turned around. &ldquo;Hmmm? You might be?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I am the mighty warrior Blaze, last survivor of the Fourth Divison.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Fourth Divison? You are from the Fourth Division?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;And you must be General Vegeta, right? Well, your glory ends here. How unfortunate that you&rsquo;ve run into me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta chuckled. &ldquo;All this talk, coming from someone in your condition?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I can fight no matter how injured I am!&rdquo; He fired a beam, Vegeta flew away. Blaze charged forward, Vegeta fired a blast, blowing him away. &ldquo;Aaaaahhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmph. What an idiot. No wonder his Fourth Division got destroyed.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>It was dawn already. The sun has come up.</p></p>

<p><p>Liana regrouped with Jerrell and Malin, and everyone was glad they were all alive. Then, a silhouetted figure came out from the dust. It was Margarita.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell ran to her. &ldquo;Margrit! Thank goodness. You&rsquo;re alive.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Of course I am. I won&rsquo;t die in a little battle like this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Liana: &ldquo;The enemy always strikes when we&rsquo;re off guard. Right now, we need to regroup with the backup forces.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Regroup? We can still fight.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Liana: &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s too dangerous.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, they all sensed a threatening presence. It was hauntingly familiar, yet so powerful it was beyond recognition. Vegeta stood on top of the rocks, staring at the heroes. His cape waved from the wind.</p></p>

<p><p>The heroes stared at him in fear and awe. Margarita sees the man who killed her father; Jerrell sees the same. At last, it&rsquo;s her chance to take revenge. But are they strong enough?</p></p>
