<p><p>The <strong>Intergalactic War</strong>, called the <strong>Great War</strong> by many because of its impact, lasted over a century. More and more planets started to join in and the casualties soon became uncountable. In the mid-eastern part of the Milky Way, galaxies and galaxies of races fought to gain power, while others fought for freedom.</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="01">1: Execute Order 66! The Purification Of The Sayans. </span></p></center>

<p> <p>Countless lives have been lost in the name of war. Warriors have died bravely in the name of freedom. But the war wages on and on. The famed Intergalactic War is now involving more and more races who were once neutral.</p></p>

<p><p>The silhouetted figures in the dark room sat around the conference table, talking about the details of the current war.</p></p>

<p><p>Member A: &ldquo;This war has been going on for eighty-six years&#8230;almost a whole century. At this rate, it might go on for another fifty years.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Member B: &ldquo;The length of time does not matter. What matters is if we will win eventually.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Member C: &ldquo;From the way things are looking, we should be beating the Rebel Faction.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Member B: &ldquo;But more and more planets are joining the Rebels. If this keeps up, we might not win at our predicted date. The key to ending the war early is to have the aid of the sayan race.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Member A: &ldquo;The sayans&#8230;one of the <strong>three main races</strong> of <strong>Arlia</strong>? Those damn blood-thirsty creatures?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Member C: &ldquo;I agree. But the King of Arlia has yet to make a decision.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Member B: &ldquo;Not to worry. It will only be a matter of time. Our lord, Dark Spectre, is a master at convincing people to join him. The sayan warriors will be an asset to us.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> While resting by himself, sitting on his throne chair, <strong>King Neflite</strong> was having a lot of thoughts on his mind. Being a king isn&rsquo;t easy. The hunt for the rebels continues, but not all countries support him yet. He wasn&rsquo;t even sure himself if this is the right thing to do. Should he join the Dark Empire?</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Neflite sensed a sinister presence close by. Really close. From the darkness, a dark figure walked out.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I-It&rsquo;s you&#8230;<strong>Lord Spectre</strong>.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It is certainly nice to see you too, your majesty.&rdquo; he said, walking by his chair.</p></p>

<p><p>Neflite felt a chill as Spectre walked past him to the other side. He was checking out the palace room.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My, my, what a neat place you have here, your majesty. The life of a king is sure grand. But the life of a supreme commander of an empire is even better. A commander of an empire of many races.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t come here just to chit-chat, did you? What is it that you want?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ah, but of course. You know what I want, your majesty.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t made my decision yet.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Then hurry up. Any great man has to make decisions quickly. But think about it, your involvement in the war will certainly be beneficial to <strong>both</strong> of us.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;And what if I refuse?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My dear king&#8230;sooner or later the <strong>Arlians</strong> will be involved in the war. That is a fact that we both know. So, you will either be on my side or you will be opposing my side. It will be your choice. And if you choose to oppose me&#8230;well&#8230;I can&rsquo;t say much about the consequences. So take your time and think about it. I will come back soon for an answer.&rdquo; Spectre walked back into the darkness.</p></p>

<p><p>Now Neflite was more worried. Spectre obviously wants him to join his cause. And he&rsquo;s being rushed. What should I do now? he thought to himself.</p></p>

<p><p>Riiiing. Riiing. The little girl tossed about in her sleep. <strong>Jerrell</strong> yawned loudly, and smashed the alarm clock with his fists. He went over to his sister&rsquo;s bed and shoved her back and forth.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Come on, sister, wake up!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p><strong>Margarita</strong> woke up and rubbed her eyes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s morning already?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Hurry up, or we&rsquo;re gonna be late.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They quickly change their clothes, and Jerrell ran to the living room.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell&rsquo;s mother, <strong>Elmira</strong>,was in the kitchen. &ldquo;Morning, honey.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Morning, mother.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She handed him his lunch bag, and gave him a peck on the cheek. &ldquo;Here you go. Enjoy your life day.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Thanks mother.&rdquo; Jerrell said. &ldquo;Margrit, hurry up.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She ran out from the bathroom, and took her lunch bag. &ldquo;Thanks mom.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They quickly run out the door, into the lawn. On the way out, they saw their father, <strong>Jeremiah</strong>, staring at the sky as usual. &ldquo;Goodbye, kids.&rdquo; he said without looking.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Bye dad!&rdquo; Jerrell said, running.</p></p>

<p><p>The brother and sister were holding hands, and they ran faster, then charged energy.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Ready?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They leaped up and soared to the sky. Margrit was excited as she felt the wind hit against her face. The rush of speed was exhilarating. Jerrell and Margrit were laughing as they flew across the city, looking at the big buildings, and the people below.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wheeee!&rdquo; she yelled happily.</p></p>

<p><p>The brother and sister look at each other, then back at the scenery. The sky was a bright blue color this morning. School is going to be fun as well. It&rsquo;s been fun everyday. They couldn&rsquo;t have wished for a better childhood.</p></p>

<p><p>At this time, Margarita is only eight years old, while Jerrell is eleven. Their parents worry about them everyday. Their kids are too young to defend themselves. A civil war might erupt at anytime.</p></p>

<p><p>Elmira walked outside to join her husband. He was still staring up, doing nothing. &ldquo;Darling?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He turned around. &ldquo;Huh? Yes, honey?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Do you have something on your mind?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, not much.&rdquo; Jeremiah said, smiling.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always the same thing.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about the war, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. The other leaders and I are still deciding whether we should take action or not. King Neflite is being pressured by the Dark Empire to join forces with them. We don&rsquo;t know what course of action he will take. But we predict that he will join them. And that means bad news for us.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Elmira: &ldquo;But you are prepared for such an event, right?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Right. But the problem is that not many people believe us. Damn these <strong>Ethiopians</strong>, they&rsquo;re so stubborn. Can&rsquo;t they see that we need to team up in order to stay strong? I don&rsquo;t understand them.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Neither do I. some people don&rsquo;t learn until it&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I fear the worst might happen, Elmira. Maybe we rebels will take action first.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>King Neflite, still sitting in the same chair, was thinking hard and deep. He was still indecisive. After all, the decision he&rsquo;s going to make will change the fate of his planet.</p></p>

<p><p><strong>Kurtus</strong>, one of his <strong>Elite Guards</strong>, bowed down before him. <br>  Neflite: &ldquo;Kurtus, you&rsquo;ve been a friend of mine for many years. What do you think I should do?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kurtus: &ldquo;Whatever that you wish, your majesty. Whatever you decide, I will respect your decision and back you up.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But it is not that easy of a decision. Refusing the Empire&rsquo;s wishes and going against them will be detrimental to us. But then again, there are rebels here who don&rsquo;t support the Empire. They protest against me everyday so I do not team up with the Empire. They are starting to become a nuisance. But if I do join the Empire, a civil war will erupt on not just Ethiopia, but all of Arlia.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So you are worried about the strength of the Rebel Faction, correct?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Everyone has been telling me that it is going to be an easy win. But it is not that simple. There are rebel sayans out there who have powers equal to that of a super elite. And we don&rsquo;t know who they are&#8230;or how many of them there are.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let me resolve this matter for you, sire. I personally know one of the members of the <strong>Elite Four</strong>. He&rsquo;s an old &lsquo;friend&rsquo; of mine.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Friend?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I might be able to convince him to surrender.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You? By yourself? That&rsquo;s too dangerous.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You need not worry, sire. I know Jeremiah well. He won&rsquo;t dare attack me. He&rsquo;s a coward.&rdquo; Kurtus said, smiling. What is he planning to do?</p></p>

<p><p>Meanwhile, Jerrell and Margarita were training in the outdoors facility, along with their classmates. Each student was to pick a partner and begin sparring. The teacher was impressed with their overall progress. Well, except for one.</p></p>

<p><p>Teacher: &ldquo;Margarita&#8230;you need to give more strength into your punches.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She hit Jerrell harder, as he dodged.</p></p>

<p><p>Teacher: &ldquo;No no no, wrong!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit hit, and Jerrell blocked.</p></p>

<p><p>Teacher: &ldquo;Agh&#8230;you&rsquo;re just too weak, you need to get stronger. Fight like your life depends on it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;I am not weak! Right, brother?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Ehhh&#8230;of course not. You just need to work on some things, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Teacher: &ldquo;Alright, this is how you do it.&rdquo; And he showed them.</p></p>

<p><p>Later on during the day, Jeremiah received a distressing tele-call from one of his old &lsquo;friends.&rsquo; The person on the other line never named himself, but he said he wanted to meet up. Jeremiah knew who it was.</p></p>

<p><p>Despite the warnings from <strong>Kanus</strong> and <strong>Coitus</strong>, Jeremiah planned on meeting up with Kurtus.</p></p>

<p><p>Kurtus landed on the cliff, with an annoying smile on his lips. He was wearing his royal combat suit, and a red scouter. &ldquo;Well I&rsquo;ll be damned. Look who decided to show up.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; Jeremiah asked coldly.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wow, cutting straight to the chase? Is that how you greet an old friend?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who is friends with you? The day you decide to support the Empire is the day I ceased knowing you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kurtus sighed. &ldquo;And here I was thinking you might change your mind. The Empire isn&rsquo;t so bad, you know&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Is that what this is about? You want me to convince the rebels to surrender?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well, yes. You have influence over them. They&rsquo;ll trust you, Jeremiah.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Forget it. You can stop wasting your time.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kurtus grabbed him by the collar. &ldquo;Fool! You know this is futile. So why are you so stubborn?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jeremiah pushed him away. Doosh. &ldquo;Hands off. You already knew my answer before you even came here. So why bother asking?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kurtus sighed again. &ldquo;And I was thinking that people might change. But something else might change your mind. I heard your wife is beautiful. And you also have two cute kids, right?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;<strong>You leave them alone</strong>!&rdquo; Jeremiah shouted angrily.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Whoa now, I didn&rsquo;t imply anything. If anyone should die, it should be you!!&rdquo; He had been secretly charging a ball behind his back, and now he threw it.</p></p>

<p><p>The ball hit Jeremiah&rsquo;s chest and burned him. &ldquo;Aaaah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kurtus ran at him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;<strong>Son of a bitch</strong>!&rdquo; Jeremiah focused his energy into his arm, and made it as sharp as a blade. Slash!</p></p>

<p><p>Kurtus was cut diagonally from his shoulder all the way to his stomach. He collapsed. &ldquo;You idiot&#8230;I&rsquo;ll get you for this.&rdquo; he murmured before he died.</p></p>

<p><p>Jeremiah uncharged his energy, and he breathed hard. Suddenly, Kanus and Coitus showed up. &ldquo;Jeremiah, what have you done?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jeremiah didn&rsquo;t say anything.</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus: &ldquo;That was one of the King&rsquo;s <strong>Elite Guards</strong>. And now he&rsquo;s dead. He is not going to let us off easily.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kanus: &ldquo;But something like this would&rsquo;ve happened sooner or later. If it&rsquo;s not Jeremiah, it&rsquo;s going to be someone else.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jeremiah: &ldquo;I know what I have done. That bastard has been annoying me for years. You have know idea how much I hated him.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus: &ldquo;Right now, we better hide the body.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo; Neflite yelled, after hearing about Kurtus&rsquo;s murder.</p></p>

<p><p>Longinus swallowed nervously. &ldquo;Our spies&rsquo; scouters have detected it, sire. His body is still not found.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How dare those damned rebels&#8230;&rdquo; Neflite said in spite. Energy charged at his hands. The Elite Guards saw it, and they could feel his anger within the energy. &ldquo;I will no longer let them get away with things like this. They&rsquo;ve gone too far. It&rsquo;s time to eliminate them!! Execute<strong> Order 66</strong>!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p></p>

<p><p>Longinus: &ldquo;Order 66? You don&rsquo;t mean&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Neflite: &ldquo;That is exactly what I mean. We will purify the sayan race once again.&rdquo;</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="02">02: Vegeta's Power. Attack The Camp! </span></p></center>

<p> <p>The King of sayans resided in a grand palace in <strong>Ethiopia</strong>, the capital city of Arlia. At this time, he had a son named <strong>Prince Neflite the Second</strong>, who was twelve years old.</p></p>

<p><p>At this time, there has been a cold war between the Rebel Faction and the Loyalist Regime. But things heated up when Neflite executed Order 66, which calls for the <strong>Purification</strong> of the sayan race.</p></p>

<p><p>Neflite: &ldquo;The term <strong>Purification </strong>is not a new concept. Even in the early days of our race, we sought to purify ourselves, meaning to rid of those who do conform to our laws. Laws are absolute. Those who disobey are vile and sinful, and they need to be eliminated. When we order a Purification of the race, we will eliminate all those who disobey with loyalty. We shall make no exceptions.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Longinus: &ldquo;But sire, isn&rsquo;t that a little drastic?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Neflite gave him an angry look, and Longinus grew more scared. &ldquo;Drastic? Non-sense. Dark Spectre grows more impatient everyday. Either we follow him or we perish. Now, eliminate those rebels immediately.</p></p>

<p><p><strong>General Vegeta</strong> was standing in the middle of the carpet, directly in front of the king. &ldquo;As you wish.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ever since Order 66 was executed, the rebels never had a day of peace. Loyalist soldiers searched nearly every town, city and village in the continent, especially the territories of Ethiopia. The security there was the strictest.</p></p>

<p><p>Due to the Rebel&rsquo;s unpreparedness, they were overpowered and slaughtered. It wasn&rsquo;t a war, it was a massacre. Those rebels who were &lsquo;lucky&rsquo; to be imprisoned were tortured to death.</p></p>

<p><p>Soldiers ambushed the town unexpectedly. The citizens ran for their lives as energy beams and other explosive things hit them. Kaboom!</p></p>

<p><p>Those who were strong enough fought back, but they were outnumbered and killed mercilessly. Even the women and children were killed.</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita and Jerrell could no longer go to school, and neither could all of the students. It was no longer safe for them. The residents of <strong>Yeta</strong>, a city on the continent of <strong>Mesatonia</strong>,have to band together in order to protect themselves. They formed a camp in a valley somewhere, hoping to hide themselves.</p></p>

<p><p>General Vegeta looked down from the mountains, but couldn&rsquo;t spot find a thing. He stood with one foot on a rock, and the other on ground. His figure was tall and strong. He wore a red cape and a sayan suit with shoulder wings, and his accessories include a golden badge on the left side of his chest. The badge had the letter &ldquo;L&rdquo; on it.</p></p>

<p><p>The air was dusty and chilly. Through his binoculars, he spotted a small settlement in the mountains, a Rebel hideout.</p></p>

<p><p><strong>Prince Neflite II</strong>: &ldquo;Did you find anything?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, my prince. A small number of Rebels.&rdquo; Vegeta checked his scouter and confirmed, &ldquo;Hmmm, their power levels are so low. How do they expect to survive?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Prince Neflite: &ldquo;Good, then it should be no problem for you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Alright, we get to have some fun!&rdquo; said little <strong>Sephia</strong>, sitting on her brother&rsquo;s shoulder.</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta: &ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ll attack in the morning. Do you think you can handle them, sister?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;Of course I can!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;These weaklings won&rsquo;t know what hit them.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Within the camp, in one of the houses&#8230;Margarita&rsquo;s mom tucked her into bed, and kissed her good night. &ldquo;Goodnight, hon.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mom, why are we hiding like this? Why do we have to keep on living like this? Why do keep on moving?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Elmira was shocked to hear this question, but she thought the time was right to explain the situation to her daughter. Jerrell was touched his bed, next to his sister&rsquo;s and joined in the conversation. &ldquo;I know things are tough for you now&#8230;it&rsquo;s tough for all of us. I&rsquo;m really sorry Margrit, but it&rsquo;s just the way things are. But don&rsquo;t worry...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Yeah, our leaders will soon unite and teach those bad guys a lesson!&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be all over soon, I promise. Soon, you&rsquo;ll be living in a peaceful planet once again...soon...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t understand! Why do they keep on attacking us? Attack our friends? And my friends? And everybody?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Elmira: &ldquo;Please, just go to sleep. Get a good night&rsquo;s sleep and we&rsquo;ll worry about that stuff tomorrow.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s late, sis. Let&rsquo;s go to sleep.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Elmira shut off the lights and walked out of the room. Jeremiah entered the house with a worried face.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Are they asleep?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;They will be. But Margarita is having a hard time.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I know. These kids don&rsquo;t deserve this kind of life style.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;Calm down.&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll wake them up.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jeremiah lowered his voice. &ldquo;I promise after this war, you and the children will live a better life, the life that you deserve.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> Elmira: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be just fine, as long as we have each other. That&rsquo;s all that matters.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, but...I can&rsquo;t go on living like this...every day wondering whether or not I&rsquo;ll live the next day, or see my family again...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, their conversation was interrupted by a loud bang. They were startled and looked through the window. A cloud of dust surrounded the shelters, and everyone in the settlement was alarmed. They quickly went outside to check the situation. As a few of them went into the dusty mist, they disappeared one by one.</p></p>

<p><p>Jeremiah: &ldquo;Damn it, it&rsquo;s them! They found us!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Elmira: &ldquo;What do we do now?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jeremiah: &ldquo;Protect the kids. Get them out of here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Elmira: &ldquo;What about you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I have to defend the camp.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But&#8230;&rdquo; she said with a sad look on her face.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I have to. It&rsquo;s my duty. I&rsquo;m one of the Elite Four. Now hurry, go!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jeremiah ran outside at once. He was in the dusty mist and can&rsquo;t see a thing. He flashed back to a moment not long ago.</p></p>

<p><p>The important leaders of Yeta were having a conference. Jeremiah was sitting on his chair, with his arms crossed.</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus: &ldquo;Rebels are getting killed left and right. Even innocent civilians are being slaughtered. I can&rsquo;t take this anymore.&rdquo; He said, banging his fist on the table.</p></p>

<p><p><strong>Kanus</strong>: &ldquo;Please, have patience.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus: &ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for Jeremiah&#8230;if only he didn&rsquo;t kill one of the king&rsquo;s Elite Guards&#8230;this wouldn&rsquo;t be happening.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jeremiah: &ldquo;Listen, Coitus, I know you&rsquo;re upset, but-&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p><strong>Kemia</strong>: &ldquo;We cannot blame Jeremiah for this. The King has been looking for an excuse to eliminate us. This would have happened eventually. Jeremiah did us a favor by killing his Elite Guard. That&rsquo;s one less person we have to worry about.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jeremiah: &ldquo;Thank you, Kemia.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p><strong>Coitus</strong>: &ldquo;Yes&#8230;I suppose you&rsquo;re right. Jeremiah, I&rsquo;m sorry about that last comment. You&rsquo;re a member of the Elite Four after all. I was just so upset.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerremiah: &ldquo;No, I understand. But now is not the time to point fingers. We need to worry about our survival. The way things look, we cannot win. Survival is our priority. We must team up with other continents before we even think about fighting back.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>And indeed, survival is the camp&rsquo;s top priority.</p></p>

<p><p>Rebels waited in the mist for their enemy to show up. To their surprise, it&rsquo;s just one guy, with a girl on his shoulder.</p></p>

<p><p>Rebel #1: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it? No way! The king wouldn&rsquo;t be foolish enough to send one person and a kid to attack al of us.</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus: &ldquo;No&#8230;don&rsquo;t underestimate him. He&rsquo;s not just any guy. He&rsquo;s General Vegeta!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The Rebels trembled at the sound of his name.</p></p>

<p><p> Vegeta and Sephia laughed at them.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Look at them, big brother! They&rsquo;re scared of us!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> Vegeta: &ldquo;Of course. What did you expect from weaklings?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The armed rebels opened fire. Bang bang...Vegeta&rsquo;s shield made him invulnerable to their lasers. He and Sephia fired energy balls at them and blew them up. Smoke was everywhere.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aaaah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Boom!</p></p>

<p><p>Kemia ran about the camp, yelling and telling everyone to wake up. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re under attack! Prepare for combat!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus stopped him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell them to prepare for combat. Vegeta is in a league of his own. We can&rsquo;t compete with him.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kemia was pissed. &ldquo;Are you saying that we should retreat? Because of <strong>one man</strong>?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not just one man&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So what if he&rsquo;s a general? We&rsquo;re strong too, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He probably has troops waiting as backup. We can&rsquo;t fall for his tricks, understand, Kemia? Please understand. Survival is our priority.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kemia sighed. &ldquo;Fine&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The soldiers kept firing at the man walking. <strong>Bang</strong>. <strong>Bang</strong>. His shield blocked all the lasers. Then he and his sister fired energy beams randomly. Boom. Boom! Soldiers were blown away and screamed. Vegeta and Sephia laughed.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Jeremiah showed up to the scene. He and Vegeta stared at each other from a distance.</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta smiled. &ldquo;Sephia, I think it is about to get serious. You better go.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Alright. Good luck, big brother.&rdquo; she flew off.</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta: (If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, that is Jeremiah Florencia. A member of what used to be the Elite Four.)</p></p>

<p><p> Jerrell: &ldquo;Mother, what is happening? What is with all the noise?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Elmira: &ldquo;Jerrell, Margrit, you two should go. We are under attack.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Under attack? By the bastards?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;But I want to help-&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Elmira: &ldquo;<strong>No</strong>! It&rsquo;s too dangerous for you. You are too young to see war. Just hurry and go. Now!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell took Margrit&rsquo;s hand and flew up a few feet. &ldquo;But what about you, mother?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Elmira: &ldquo;I am going to help your father. Now go, hurry.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Mom!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Elmira: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be fine, honey. Please, go.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The kids flew off.</p></p>

<p><p>Elmira hated when she had to lie to her kids. She said she&rsquo;ll be fine, but she knows there&rsquo;s a chance they could die.</p></p>

<p><p>Neflite: &ldquo;Hmmm, I hear lots of explosions. It looks like Vegeta is at it again.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p><strong>Leozack</strong>: &ldquo;My prince, is it wise to send him and his sister alone in there? There are a lot of strong Rebels in that camp. I think I should assist him.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Neflite: &ldquo;Vegeta is Vegeta. He will get the job done. It is not necessary for you to go in and waste your energy.&rdquo; Suddenly, he sensed something. &ldquo;Hmm? He grabbed the binoculars and looked. &ldquo;Ooh, very interesting. Leozack, stay here. You are not to move until I return.&rdquo; He flew off.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But, prince&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>After flying for a while, Jerrell took Margrit on the ground so they could rest. Suddenly, Neflite approached them.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Who is that, brother?&rdquo; <br>  Prince Neflite: &ldquo;Who do I look like to you? What do you think this golden</p></p>

<p><p>medallion is, rebel?&rdquo; He pointed at the golden badge on his chest proudly.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;No way! You&rsquo;re the prince of sayans!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Neflite: &ldquo;Well, that didn&rsquo;t take long. At least you still have a brain.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s scaring me!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t leave us alone, prince jerk!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Prince Neflite, you blasted rebel! And I&rsquo;m the strongest kid alive!&rdquo; he shouted angrily, yet proudly.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;What do you want from us?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Leave us alone!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Neflite: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t tolerate rebels! You and your sister should join us. I&rsquo;ll give you this rare chance, since you&rsquo;re only kids misled by your parents.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Our parents didn&rsquo;t mislead us! We&rsquo;ll never join your side, never!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, tell him, brother!&rdquo; she shouted confidently.</p></p>

<p><p>Neflite: &ldquo;You morons&#8230;how dare you&#8230;that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He attacked Jerrell and they started a sayan kid fight. Neflite, as the prince of all sayans, showed his superior techniques. Jerrell ran and punched crazily. Neflite dodged skillfully, and stepped to the side, then tripped Jerrell as he went forward. While off balance, Neflite whacked him on the back, and the stomach, and punched his face. Pow!</p></p>

<p><p>Neflite kept on going, and gave Jerrell more bruises.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit was half crying as she watched helplessly. Neflite gave Jerrell a few more hits. Pow! Wham!</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Stop hurting him! Please! Stop it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>As Neflite grabbed Jerrell, Margrit grabbed his arm and pulled him away. Then the little prince hit her and pushed her on the ground. She started crying like a baby and this really upset Jerrell. In a fiery rage, Jerrell attacked the prince vigorously.</p></p>

<p><p>Neflite jumped away. &ldquo;Damn. You actually hurt me. That&rsquo;s not bad for a rebel. But my dad will get you for this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell walked towards his sister and helped her get up.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Are you hurt sis? Did he hurt you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;WAAAH! It hurts!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell turned towards Neflite and attacked with words.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No one hurts my sister! I don&rsquo;t care who you are, even if you&rsquo;re a prince. You&rsquo;re nothing but a spoiled brat!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Neflite: &ldquo;What did you say?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Leozack showed up.</p></p>

<p><p>Neflite: &ldquo;Leozack? I thought I told you to stay put?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Leozack: &ldquo;But my prince, I thought you&rsquo;d be in danger.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Grrrr. I&rsquo;ll forgive you this one time. Leozack, take care of those brats.&rdquo; Neflite said, pointing.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t do anything to you! WAAAH!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell noticed the &ldquo;L&rdquo; symbol on his sayan suit, and got into fighting position.</p></p>

<p><p>Leozack: &ldquo;Oh my&#8230;these are children&#8230;just about your age, prince.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Neflite: &ldquo;Bleh. They&rsquo;re just some worthless garbage.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Leozack: &ldquo;Children, where are you parents? Still in the camp?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Why should I tell you?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Leozack: &ldquo;A tough one, eh? There&rsquo;s no escape, little children. Abandon your parents and join us, or suffer their fate.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Never, I&rsquo;ll never abandon my parents.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The Florencia children are now at the mercy of Prince Neflite II and an Elite Guard. Will they be able to escape this hopeless predicament?</p></p>


<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="03">03: Away From Home! The Nameless Warrior! </span></p></center>

<p> <p>Dark Spectre is a mysterious being who took the throne of the Dark Empire within a short time. It seemed as though he was meant for such a role. No one knows about his origins. His past is clouded in mystery, which makes him even scarier. He is a man of insurmountable talents. So far, no one has been able to defeat him. All those who fought him one on one are dead, and those few who are lucky enough to survive end up going mad. He is said to be the strongest warrior in the galaxy.</p></p>

<p><p>Some people wonder how he is able to manipulate dark energy without losing his health. Rumors have it that he was born on a planet filled with dark energy. It could be possible, but no one knows for sure. What race is he? How old is he? Where did he come from? All those things are unknown. But one thing is for sure. If you see him, you better pray, because you will not have long to live.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell and Margarita were still in big trouble. Leozack walked slowly towards them, as Neflite grinned.</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita was shivering with fear. &ldquo;B-Brother&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Grrr&#8230;don&rsquo;t worry sister. I will take care of this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Leozack: &ldquo;You want to fight me? How interesting.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Neflite: (You fools. If you retaliate, you&rsquo;re going to die.)</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell&rsquo;s heart was beating faster and faster as the adult approached. Will he stand a chance?</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, a mysterious sayan with dark colored clothes and a white cape appeared from the sky. A laser beam hit the ground, and Leozack jumped away. Smoke covered the area. Neflite coughed.</p></p>

<p><p>Leozack: &ldquo;My prince!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They didn&rsquo;t know what hit them. The warrior grabbed Jerrell and his sister and flew away towards safety.</p></p>

<p><p>Neflite: &ldquo;Damn it. They escaped. Who was it that ambushed us?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Leozack: &ldquo;Sorry, prince. I did not take a good look at his face.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Neflite: &ldquo;Damn it! Everyone around me is useless.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The brother and sister were taken to a remote cave.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Thank you mister. You saved us.&rdquo; Margrit said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No problem. I cannot ignore those in need.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We highly appreciate your help. I am Jerrell. This is my sister, Magarita. What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;Forget that now. Get some sleep.&rdquo; he answered. He was only avoiding it because he had no name.</p></p>

<p><p>The kids slept beside the fire burning on the sticks. The warrior watched them sleep and pitied them. These kids have to endure such suffering. He walked over and put his cape on Margrit as a blanket.</p></p>

<p><p>(Whatever happened to the camp at Yeta?) he wondered. (Could these children be the children of the Rebels at the camp?)</p></p>

<p><p>It was morning, and the nameless warrior was already awake, watching out for attacks. Sitting on a rock, waiting, he sensed someone approaching - no, more than one. A whole gang of soldiers.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re here!&rdquo; he shouted. He quickly went inside the cave to wake the kids up.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;...Uhhh...what? Huh?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Get up you bum! Loyalists are coming! It&rsquo;s not safe here, leave at once!&rdquo; Margrit: &ldquo;What about you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go ahead and distract them. Now go, there&rsquo;s no time!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell followed his orders, and took his sister far away.</p></p>

<p><p>The soldiers surrounded the nameless warrior and prepared to kill.</p></p>

<p><p>Nameless looked calm and relaxed. He was confident that he&rsquo;s going to win. The soldiers thought the same, knowing he was out-numbered. The warrior&rsquo;s eyes remained closed and the wind blew them hard. Suddenly, the soldiers all attacked at once.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Do you think he&rsquo;ll be okay?&rdquo; asked Margrit worriedly.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Of course he will be. I can tell he&rsquo;s strong. He survived an attack on one of the Elite Guards. Whoever he is, we owe him our lives.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hey, I want to go see mother and father.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell thought for a bit. &ldquo;Well, the danger might be over. Fine, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;<br>  &ldquo;Yay!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmmmph. Such rubbish. The king&rsquo;s men are worthless.&rdquo; the white caped warrior said, dusting his hands.</p></p>

<p><p>The five soldiers were now five bloody bodies, laying on the ground to rot.</p></p>

<p><p>It seemed that they underestimated his abilities. He was definitely no ordinary warrior. The soldiers were dead before they could even be surprised.</p></p>

<p><p>He was an orphan at birth and he had no name. Those who do know him call him the <strong>Nameless Warrior</strong>. His powers superseded any super elite sayan. Very few have seen this warrior and lived, so his identity is unclear. Although he&rsquo;s neither a Rebel nor a Loyalist, he&rsquo;s killed numerous Loyalists in the past, so he&rsquo;s definitely on the king&rsquo;s most wanted list. But the problem is &#8230; they don&rsquo;t know what he looks like.</p></p>

<p><p>As King Neflite had a meeting with his Elite Guards and advisors, he sensed a familiar, and evil force nearby. He quickly called the meeting off.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We shall discuss this later on. Adjourned.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The men all left. Now it was only Neflite by himself in the quiet, empty room.</p></p>

<p><p>Dark Spectre showed up. &ldquo;Very good, Neflite. You sayans have an amazing sixth sense. &ldquo;You sense me coming before I even entered the palace. But you need not call off the meeting just for me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I can smell your stench a mile away, Spectre. These men need not meet you in person, or they might get sick for a week.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Spectre laughed. &ldquo;Always a comedian, your majesty. I have heard the good news.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I am doing as you wish. The Rebel Faction is weak and disorganized. They will be taken care of soon.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I see that the war is already starting. My commanders will certainly be delighted to hear about the good news. After all, Arlia is a big asset to the Great War. That is why I come in person just to see you, your majesty.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;And you will keep your end of the bargain, right? I eliminate the Rebels, and you will not harm my people.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But of course.&rdquo; Spectre said, taking an apple from the tray. &ldquo;I am a man of my word. As long as Arlia is on our side, the war is ours. And not only will we not harm you, but we will reward you as well. One the war is over, we will gain massive territory. We will split it up.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Alright. As long as you keep your word.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh my, these fruits sure are perky. I don&rsquo;t know why you royalty eat this stuff.&rdquo; He crushed the apple and dropped it on the floor. He walked away laughing.</p></p>

<p><p>Neflite was pissed at his disrespectfulness. But then again, he <strong>is</strong> the lord of the universe, and not one to be messed with. Spectre does say &lsquo;your majesty&rsquo; but it&rsquo;s only for convention&rsquo;s sake. Neflite was sure glad he&rsquo;s gone.</p></p>

<p><p>Back in the valley, Jeremiah was holding Elmira&rsquo;s hand, and they were running away from Vegeta. They hid behind a boulder and prayed for their safety. Vegeta searched the area, but had trouble finding them.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Where are you hiding? Cowards. Show yourself! Arrrgh.&rdquo; he said angrily. He flew up and continued looking. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a matter of time. I&rsquo;ll get you Rebels sooner or later.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jeremiah: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use hiding like this. He&rsquo;ll find us in time.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Elmira: &ldquo;I just hope our children are alright.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Me too. But we have to worry about ourselves right now.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She sighed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Listen, we gotta take this risk. We&rsquo;ll make a surprise attack on Vegeta and kill him.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You think we&rsquo;re up to it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We have got to try.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They both nodded.</p></p>

<p><p>Meanwhile, the kids ran into the Nameless Warrior again. They were so glad he was alright.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Wow, you made it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nameless: &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Did they hurt you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Of course not. They were weaklings compared to me. My power was too much for them.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Wow...you must be really good...like my father.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Speaking of father, he&rsquo;s under attack by Vegeta.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I see. Who is your father?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;His name is Jeremiah.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nameless: &ldquo;Jeremiah? Jeremiah Florencia? One of the Elite Four?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Yeah, he brags about that all the time.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nameless: &ldquo;Where is the camp?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Last night it was attacked. It&rsquo;s located somewhere down those hills.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nameless: &ldquo;If your parents are still alive, I may be able to find them. Just hide here and leave everything to me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Ok.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The white caped warrior flew away.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Wow, he took on all those soldiers by himself. He must be a really strong guy!&rdquo;</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="04">04: Jeremiah's Legacy. </span></p></center>

<p> <p>The group known as the Elite Four were four of the strongest sayan warriors around. Ten years ago, they were feared and respected by everyone on the community. Before the &lsquo;purification,&rsquo; there was tension between the Rebels and Loyalists, but nothing drastic happened. But even since a death of a friend upset King Neflite, he ordered the purification of the race. And thus, the civil war officially began. But the question remains: which is stronger - members of the Elite Four, or the King&rsquo;s Elite Guards?</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta was still searching for the rebels in the valley. &ldquo;Arrgh!&rdquo; he grunted. He was getting agitated and annoyed. When he finds them (and he will, sooner or later) he&rsquo;s gonna teach them a good lesson. That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re gonna get for making him search so long. He wasn&rsquo;t going to let a single rebel escape his grasp.</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus and Kemia escaped. Kemia reunited with Kanus at a refuge camp. But Coitus was no where to be found.</p></p>

<p><p>Jeremiah and Elmira could see him. &ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; he asked. Elmira nodded. They</p></p>

<p><p>got ready.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Arrgh! Where are you?!&rdquo; Vegeta said angrily.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Over here!&rdquo; Jeremiah shouted. He jumped at him and kicked Vegeta&rsquo;s chest.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oof!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta was caught by surprise, as they planned. Elmira charged and fired an energy ball. Boom!</p></p>

<p><p>They thought that should stun him for a while. Vegeta popped out of the smoke and charged at Jeremiah. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found you!&rdquo; Wham! He got punched. Elmira ran at him and kicked, Vegeta blocked her foot and kicked her down.</p></p>

<p><p>Jeremiah: &ldquo;Looks like I have no choice but to fight you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;And fight me you will. But live you will not.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Elmira: &ldquo;Today we will kill you or die trying!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jeremiah: &ldquo;Long live freedom!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He fired an energy ball, Vegeta dodged.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell and Margrit arrived at the scene, and were not noticed by Vegeta, or their parents, who were concentrating on fighting. Margrit wanted to greet her parents, she began to shout when Jerrell grabbed her and pushed her behind a rock.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;<strong>Shhh</strong>! It&rsquo;s dangerous out there! That bad guy will kill you if he finds you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But&#8230;daddy...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Trust me. Please, sis. This is for your own good.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Elmira charged and punched; Vegeta blocked her fist and kicked her chest. She collapsed.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Mother&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t expose ourselves. Or else we&rsquo;re doomed.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Nooo!&rdquo; Jeremiah yelled. He attacked brutally, and Vegeta blocked his attacks. He countered with a punch to the stomach. Thud!</p></p>

<p><p>Blood dripped from his mouth. &ldquo;Ugh&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta crossed his arms. &ldquo;Hmph. What a waste of my time. Is this the power of a former member of the Elite Four?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Former? The Elite Four still exists.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kid me. They&rsquo;re obsolete now. They&rsquo;re not even a threat.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jeremiah powered up. Vegeta saw it, and he powered up as well.</p></p>

<p><p>Elmira: &ldquo;Jer-emiah&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>(I didn&rsquo;t come this far just to lose now. I won&rsquo;t let my people down.) When done powering up, he charged forward.</p></p>

<p><p>Jeremiah flashed back to a time not long ago. It was the time when things were actually peaceful compared to now. It was the best time of his life. He and the Elite Four just finished a long training session. They were all happy. Jeremiah himself, Coitus, Kane, and one other person.</p></p>

<p><p>The other rebels looked at them with respect and admiration.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So these are the Elite Four. The four strongest rebels in our country.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I sure envy them. They are so strong.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>But unfortunately, Burdok went off on his own. And so did the last member. Only himself and Coitus remained. And because of poor leadership, the rebels were disorganized. And that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re being slaughtered right now.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yaaaaaahhh!!&rdquo; Jeremiah punched with all his might.</p></p>

<p><p>Everyone watched in suspense. Everything seemed to turn white and become slow motion.</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta dodged the fist, and punched him in the stomach. Doosh!</p></p>

<p><p>(Oh no!) Jeremiah thought as he felt the jolt of pain. Wham! He collapsed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha! Any last words?&rdquo; the general asked.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Da-daddy!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell could no longer contain her. She was powering up and out of control. &ldquo;Sis, calm down!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Whoosh! In a flash, she charged at Vegeta.</p></p>

<p><p>Whack! She kicked him in the face. He didn&rsquo;t know what hit him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Daddy...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jeremiah: &ldquo;What are you doing here? Run Margrit! Get out of here!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;No, I want to stay with you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta recovered angrily. &ldquo;Why you little...so you&rsquo;re Jeremiah&rsquo;s daughter, eh? Owww how cute. It&rsquo;s a shame you have to die so young.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Run now, Margarita. Go!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t leave you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Run! Get out of here!&rdquo; he shouted.</p></p>

<p><p>So she ran. Vegeta appeared in front of her. She gasped. &ldquo;Hahahahaha! Where are you going, little one?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta gathered energy and fired a beam. Jeremiah jumped in front of her and grabbed her. The beam hit his back and he screamed. &ldquo;Aaaahhh!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Daddy!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Run...Mar-grit...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Daddy!&rdquo; she shouted with tears.</p></p>

<p><p>He collapsed in front of her very eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta: &ldquo;Ahahahaha! That&rsquo;s the end of Jeremiah. What a brave and noble man. Too bad. You died. Another rebel casualty.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jeremiah crawled. &ldquo;Run&#8230;h-hurry&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...&rdquo; Jerrell muttered with tears.</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta opened his palm and gathered energy, preparing to blast Margrit. Jerrell charged at him, and he looked to the side. &ldquo;Another one?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell kicked his shoulder and made him fall. He quickly grabbed Margrit&rsquo;s arm and ran. &ldquo;Daddy...daddy...&rdquo; she said, looking back.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Margrit, we have to worry about ourselves!&rdquo; Jerrell shouted.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly Vegeta appeared in front of them.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yipes!&rdquo; the boy yelled.</p></p>

<p><p>It looked like the end of them now. An energy ball came from the sky and landed close to Vegeta. &ldquo;Not again! You rebels keep coming out of nowhere.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nameless: &ldquo;Go children. I will take it from here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Elmira: &ldquo;Run Margrit run!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The kids flew to the air.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Daddddddy!&rdquo; Margrit was crying.</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta: &ldquo;You have a lot of guts. But you&rsquo;re gonna end up just like him.&rdquo; he said, pointing at Jeremiah.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I doubt it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit and Jerrell were crying sadly.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Daddy...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair!&rdquo; Jerrell said, punching a boulder.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Daddy...you can&rsquo;t die&#8230;&rdquo; Margrit sobbed, rubbing her eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Margrit, I&rsquo;ll protect you. I promise. I won&rsquo;t let dad die for nothing.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The nameless warrior showed up. He was walking limply, with one hand on his shoulder. Blood dripped from his arm.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mister! I&rsquo;m so glad to see you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Me too. I am glad you escaped safely.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Your arm!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nameless: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay. It&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The children ran to him and cried and he hugged them.</p></p>

<p><p>When they calmed down a little, Nameless began to speak. &ldquo;I was barely able to escape from Vegeta. I am sorry I could not save your parents.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo; *Sob* What...what do we *sob* do now?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Listen up, kids. I know how you must feel now. Vegeta is on to you. You better get out of this planet as soon as possible. It&rsquo;s the only way.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;But, but...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No buts. It&rsquo;s the only safe way. I have a space pod around here somewhere. It&rsquo;s already set to go to planet T-5, a neutral zone. Go and look for the remaining the member of the Elite Four. You must remember.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Are you coming with us?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, I am afraid I cannot. There is much to be done here in Ethiopia. Just go.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Either leave, or be hunted down. That was their choice. Jerrell accepted his fate silently. Margarita was still in denial about the whole thing. But regardless, they have to flee for their safety.</p></p>

<p><p>The space pod left Arlia&rsquo;s atmosphere, reaching outer space. Margrit pressed her hands and face against the window. &ldquo;Mommy and daddy&#8230;&rdquo; she said with tears. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re still down there.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>As they stared at the planet, they saw the huge explosions from the war. The war was already raging on.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry Margrit. I&rsquo;ll take care of you. I promise.&rdquo; Jerrell touched his sister&rsquo;s hand.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair!! *Sob* It&rsquo;s not fair!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be alright. I promise.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p> <p>Inside a temple, an old man drank his tea. He lifted his head and sipped the cup. &ldquo;Ahhh this tea is delicious.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He was surrounded by four wooden walls and on his right there was a window which led to a balcony. It had a great view of the sky and forest. A comet crashed into the forest and created a boom.</p></p>

<p><p>The temple shuddered. The cup of tea spilled on his lap. &ldquo;Darn it! What could have caused that?&rdquo; His curiosity took over him and he decided to check it out.</p></p>

<p><p>Within the forest, a crater was created and in the center of it was a space pod. Steam came out of its bottom. The old man stood at the edge, wondering who or what could be inside.</p></p>

<p><p>The pod door started to open. <strong>Lotus</strong> was feeling nervous. What if it&rsquo;s a monster - or even worse - a dark soldier? To his surprise, it was two children - a boy and a girl.</p></p>

<p><p>They were both asleep. Margarita was resting against her brother&rsquo;s shoulder, and he was embracing her. Lotus thought they adorable.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Magrit, wake up. We made it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita opened her eyes. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. This is it, Ruskus.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We did. Yay!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell took her sister out of the ship and they saw Lotus.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hello there, children.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh hello mister. We&rsquo;re lost. We came from another planet.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Where did you come from?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Arlia.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh my, you must have traveled a long way.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Margrit said shyly.</p></p>

<p><p>So, the old man took them inside his temple, providing blankets and hot tea. The children were very grateful of his hospitality. The company of three was kneeling on the wooden floor.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell sipped his cup of tea loudly. &ldquo;Thank you so much for your kindness, mister.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mmmmm. This is tea tastes great.&rdquo; Margrit said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you think so?&rdquo; the old man said, satisfied.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We thank you so much for your hospitality, sir. By the way, my name is Jerrell. And this is my sister Margarita.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The old man drank his tea. &ldquo;You can call me Lotus. So you mentioned that you are from Arlia?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s correct, Mr. Lotus.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Are you sayans?&rdquo; he asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell stopped drinking tea. &ldquo;We fled all the way from our home Arlia to over here. Our parents were killed by the damn Loyalists. We had no choice but to come here, where there isn&rsquo;t a war. Me and my sister are only kids. We couldn&rsquo;t do anything to help.&rdquo; Jerrell&rsquo;s facial expression was one of pain and spite and he grabbed his knees and squeezed them.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit stared at the floor in sadness and helplessness.</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus looked towards the window. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m...sorry. I know it must be tough for you. But I do know about the civil war happening in Arlia. The war is pretty bad right now. Not a single place on the whole planet is safe. No rebel is safe. They are trying to purify the race.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Purify?&rdquo; Jerrell repeated, offended by that word. &ldquo;IThe Loyalists are the ones who need to be purified. They are anything but pure! They&rsquo;re cold blooded hounds!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A moment of silence. Then Lotus continued. &ldquo;I agree. But you did the right thing in coming here. This is planet <strong>T-5</strong>, otherwise known as <strong>Ruskus</strong>. This is a neutral planet, so the Empire will not interfere. You are safe over here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;I miss my mom and dad&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;You have to be strong, Margarita. We are sayans, remember?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;I know. But it hurts so much! I swear, one day I will get revenge for my dad!&rdquo; she said, with tears on her face.</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;By the way, who are your parents?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;My mother was Elmira. And my father was Jeremiah.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus was shocked. &ldquo;Jeremiah? As in Jeremiah Florencia? Of the Elite Four?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Why, yes. My father always bragged about that.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: (Unbelievable. These are Jeremiah&rsquo;s children? This must be fate.)</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;He was a good warrior. He didn&rsquo;t deserve to die. Damn that Vegeta&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>(Jeremiah&#8230;I didn&rsquo;t even get to say goodbye to you. You&rsquo;ve been messed with such beautiful children.) Lotus could&rsquo;ve cried right now, but he held it in. (My old friend, don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll avenge you. And I will take care of your son and daughter.) &ldquo;Alright then, Margarita and Jerrell, is it? Your long journey ends here. You can stay in my temple as long as you wish.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;No, we couldn&rsquo;t accept such an offer. You have done much for us, Mr. Lotus. We don&rsquo;t want to trouble you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita really wanted to stay. She wish her brother would shut up.</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;It is no trouble at all. I live here by myself in this big temple. Sometimes it gets lonely. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind having company.&rdquo; he said, smiling genuinely.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit&rsquo;s eyes lighted up, and so did Jerrell&rsquo;s. They bowed, their foreheads touching the floor.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Thank you so much, sir!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus was like, you don&rsquo;t have to do that. He became a little embarrassed of their politeness. (Jeremiah, I&rsquo;ll take care of these two for you. <strong>It&rsquo;s the least I can do</strong>.)</p></p>

<p><p>Old man Lotus meant what he said. In fact, he wanted them to stay until they grow up. He wanted to be a parent that they lost. He felt sympathy for these poor little kids. So cute and bright, they don&rsquo;t deserve their fate. In return for his accepting them, the kids showed they were more than grateful. They respected him in every way and became his students.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wow. Thank you, Mr. Lotus.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;From now on, you can call me Master Lotus.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes Master Lotus.&rdquo; they said together.</p></p>

<p><p>On that same day, Lotus introduced them to the community of Memphis. He stood by the window and pointed in the direction of the village.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Over there is the village of <strong>Memphis</strong>. Whenever you get bored you can go there and meet some people and even make some friends. The people there are usually friendly and caring.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Ooh...is it a big village?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, quite a small one. There are stores and hotels and even a school. Everything that a city needs.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Squint really hard and you should be able to see it. It is not far from this temple. Just go through the woods, around the lake and you&rsquo;re there. A convenient walk, wouldn&rsquo;t you say?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>For now, the kids were safe from the war. Although they could never forget the day that their father died, they were at peace for now. Later that evening, the kids made a little visit to the village to see what it was like. They loved it.</p></p>

<p><p>The village was basically a bunch of houses and structures surrounded by a protective fence. Outside the fence was the wilderness. The main entrance was unguarded and anybody could come or go as they please. Most people were broke but not unhappy. Women covered their heads with hoods and their clothes were long and touched the floor. For the men, who were mostly farmers, they wore dirty shirts and some pants. Stores flourished with customers, businesses prospered.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hail King Neflite!&rdquo; the man in uniform shouted as Neflite walked across the platform to his throne chair. Neflite&rsquo;s son walked with him.</p></p>

<p><p>In front of him lay the royal red carpet, stretched to the end of the room to the large double doors. Standing next to the carpet were two rows of men. They were the king&rsquo;s advisors, Elite Guards, and trusted friends. Everybody kneeled and bowed as the king sat down.</p></p>

<p><p>The king motioned his arms, and everybody stood up. &ldquo;Bring in the traitor.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The double doors opened and two men, bringing a woman, came in. They stood in front of the plight of stairs and made her kneel. She was in chains.</p></p>

<p><p>Neflite: &ldquo;Ahh, so this is Elmira Florencia? The wife of Jeremiah.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ah hem, correction, the wife of the late Jeremiah.&rdquo; one of the advisors said. Laughter was heard.</p></p>

<p><p>Elmira did not look up or move a bit.</p></p>

<p><p>King: &ldquo;Hmmmph. Well, traitor, what do you have to say for yourself?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I have nothing to say.&rdquo; she said, not looking up.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Being tough, eh? It&rsquo;s too bad that nobody can help you now. As of now you have two choices. One, tell us where the other rebels are hiding and I may lighten your punishment sentence. Or if you do not tell, then you will be punished with the full sentence. It&rsquo;s your choice.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I will tell nothing!&rdquo; she yelled.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So stubborn, eh? Maybe a few more nights in the dungeons might convince you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Do what you may, but I will never betray my allies.&rdquo; She smiled. &ldquo;You killed my husband and took away my children. I have nothing more to lose.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>King: &ldquo;So shall it be! Bring her back to the prison. Make her talk.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The guards brought her outside.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Come forth, General Vegeta.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta, one of the people within the two lines, stepped up and bowed. &ldquo;Yes your majesty.&rdquo; His little sister accompanied him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How is the progress on the war?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Progress is excellent, your majesty. As you all know, Jeremiah, one of the Elite Four, was killed by me. Rather easily, I might add. We are hunting down the other rebel camps. Believe me when I say this, they have absolutely no chance of winning.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Good. That is what I like to hear. Next, <strong>Jarus</strong>.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta went back to the line and <strong>Jarus</strong> stepped up.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How is it going on your continent?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jarus kneeled on one knee. &ldquo;It is also going very well in my area. We&rsquo;ve won two consecutive victories over the rebels. As Vegeta says, they have no chance of victory.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus, Margrit and Jerrell were walking in the hallway. &ldquo;My fellow students, I think you are ready for your training.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Where are we going to?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;This basement in my temple has a training facility. I&rsquo;ve kept this a secret from other people. But now, I think the time is appropriate for me to reveal it to you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>While walking in the dark hallway, they reached an empty, mechanical room with four walls. This is the training room. A staircase led to the <strong>Control Room</strong>, which has a window that you can see the activities of the training room.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Ooohhh...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s big.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I will be training you intensely so you can become true warriors. This is your training room. Basically, you will be fighting holographic images created by the computers in the Control Room. These images will feel real and will cause real pain. So if you&rsquo;re not careful, you might actually die. That is why you cannot use this training facility without my supervision.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Amazing.&rdquo; Margrit said.</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;This concept of training originated from <strong>Macedonion</strong>, a planet currently involved in the Great War. It was developed by an organization called the <strong>Black Hand</strong>. The control room above is where you can control the settings. You can choose the type of background, your enemies, and the level at which they fight. Everyone will start at level one. The highest level is twenty.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit, amazed: &ldquo;Wow! It&rsquo;s just like a game. This is going to be fun.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Margrit,&rdquo; her bro said. &ldquo;Training isn&rsquo;t all about fun and games.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; she said, sticking her tongue out.</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus laughed. &ldquo;Let me tell you this right now. It will not be as easy as you think. The average sayan takes about five years to reach level 20.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit and Jerrell: &ldquo;<strong>Five years?!</strong>&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus knew how they would react. Everyone he trained reacted the same way. &ldquo;Yes, it does take that long. Everyone whom I&rsquo;ve trained had the same reaction as you two, believe it or not. When you do reach level 20, you will be the equivalent of a first class elite soldier.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Elite?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;First class?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;Correct.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell took off his cape and stood in the middle of the training room. &ldquo;Heh. Lemme get a shot at this. I&rsquo;ll show you how easy this thing is. It can&rsquo;t be that hard.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The king waited in his bedroom, sitting on his bed. A troop brought Elmira in. Her arms were tied up behind her back, and she was wearing nothing but a pink towel.</p></p>

<p><p>Neflite got off his bed. The troop pushed Elmira onto the chair.</p></p>

<p><p>Neflite: &ldquo;Very well. You may go.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The troop left the room.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well, Elmira,&rdquo; he said, checking her out from top to bottom, &ldquo;How have they been treating you in the dungeon?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Elmira just stared at him with both fear and spite.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Not much of a talker, eh?&rdquo; he said, walking closer to the chair.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Stay away!&rdquo; She got up and ran away.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Where are the rebels?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish. Tell me now or else.&rdquo; She shrieked and stepped back. &ldquo;Get away...get away!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Still won&rsquo;t tell me, huh? Then you have to be punished.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Elmira backed off the wall. Neflite came towards her and she shrieked. &ldquo;Stay back! Stay back! Please!&rdquo; she screamed.</p></p>

<p><p>Neflite came closer and closer. He grabbed her shoulders and laughed. She tried to get free but couldn&rsquo;t. He slapped her face and kissed her lips. As his lips were locked into hers, he was holding her tightly and she couldn&rsquo;t move a bit. He enjoyed every second of it. When he just finished, Elmira screamed and pushed him away. She ran for the door, but it was locked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no escape. It&rsquo;s just you and me.&rdquo; Neflite smiled.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please no! Stay back...&rdquo; Tears were coming out of her eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, please...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She made a punch and he grabbed her fist. &ldquo;Weakling!&rdquo; He kicked her and she fell on the floor.</p></p>

<p><p>He approached her and laughed as she crawled backwards. Her big, bright eyes were full of fear and she gasped and breathed hard as his shadow covered her. She crawled up with difficulty, using the wall as support. He slapped her hard and a red spot appeared on her face.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ahhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He grabbed her and she was helpless in his arms. He touched her thigh and went inside her towel.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...please....stop....please!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He kissed her lips. She pushed him away. He grabbed her towel.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please no!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is your last chance.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Alright...they&rsquo;re in the Applachian mountains. Just let me go...please!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now that wasn&rsquo;t so hard, was it?&rdquo; He smiled. Suddenly, he pulled the towel hard off her and she was naked. He sniffed the towel and tossed it away.</p></p>

<p><p>Neflite grabbed her and kissed her lips. Tears came down her eyes. He pushed her on the bed and laughed. He kissed her lips and grabbed her hands.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell was about to begin his first training session, and he was excited, and Margrit was excited for him. Margrit and Master Lotus observed him from the control room, and Lotus was doing the settings for the background.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Are you ready, Jerrell?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, let&rsquo;s get this thing started.&rdquo;</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="06">06: Train Hard. Hope For The Future. </span></p></center>

<p> <p>As everyone knows, the Great War lasted almost a century, and it&rsquo;s still going on. Tragedy and triumph was the summary of the Great War in Arlia. The rebels were successful in some areas, but their success did not last. As the Loyalist regime gradually grew in size, the rebel forces were reduced and forced to scatter and hide.</p></p>

<p><p>Runaway rebels have created camps in which they could live in and defend themselves. These camps only last about a while. The groups keep moving, not wanting to be discovered.</p></p>

<p><p>The death of Jeremiah and the disappearance of Coitus were considered a great triumph by Vegeta. To the loyalists, this is not a war, but a search and hunt massacre. They did not even consider the Rebel Faction to be a challenge. Slowly but surely&#8230;the Rebels will plan to retaliate.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell couldn&rsquo;t help but be excited as his first training was about to begin. Lotus set the current settings for the battle.</p></p>

<p><p>[ Level: 1 ]</p></p>

<p><p>[ Terrain: Apocalypse ]</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, the empty room was no longer an empty room. Jerrell found himself standing on a red, barren wasteland. There were boulders everywhere.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Wow, it looks so real.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;The mind can conceive many things. As long as the mind believes it is real, then it is real to the mind. Now, let us begin.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A cyborg approached. It was a Class Z cyborg, the weakest one in the game engine. It fired a laser. Jerrell dodged and jumped, and punched the cyborg&rsquo;s face, smashing it. Wham. The cyborg shut down. Beep.</p></p>

<p><p>Behind him, three more identical cyborgs approached. They fired. Jerrell rolled on the floor and jumped to evade. Wham! Pow! Wham! He trashed all of them, hitting them in the head and smashing their control units.</p></p>

<p><p>Computer: [ Level 1: CLEAR ]</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Good job, brother!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;Do not be so happy yet. Level one is the first level. Even a child can pass it easily. The levels will incrementally get harder.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh. Bring it on.&rdquo; Jerrell blasted a few more robots. Bam. &ldquo;What? That&rsquo;s all?&rdquo; Everything turned back to the empty room.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit ran down the stairs, entering the training room, to her brother. &ldquo;That was great, brother! I want to try too.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Uhhh&#8230;you want to try? Are you sure?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit smiled and nodded.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;But I dunno&#8230;it&rsquo;s kinda dangerous.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmph. Danger is my middle name!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;If she feels she is ready, then let her have a shot. Do not worry, I am monitoring the entire environment and I will see that nothing goes wrong. The second that her life is in danger, I will terminate the program.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell went to the control room, as Margarita waited anxiously in the empty room.</p></p>

<p><p>Meanwhile, somewhere in the outskirts of Yeta&#8230;</p></p>

<p><p>Nameless hid in a cave, sitting down. He held his bleeding arm, and breathed hard. &ldquo;Damn it&#8230;&rdquo; He began applying bandages to his wound. &ldquo;That bastard Vegeta&#8230;he is stronger than I thought.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>And he proceeded to flash back.</p></p>

<p><p><strong>Nimbus</strong>, Leozack, and <strong>Radus</strong> were observing the fight from a distance away.</p></p>

<p><p>Radus: &ldquo;They are about to start.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe someone would be stupid enough to fight Vegeta.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Leozack: &ldquo;But this guy is no ordinary guy.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus: &ldquo;Vegeta made short work of Jeremiah. What chance does this guy have?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta: &ldquo;You have a lot of guts. But you&rsquo;re gonna end up just like him.&rdquo; he said, pointing at Jeremiah.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I doubt it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Elmira gasped, and made a run for it. Vegeta chased her, and Nameless followed suit. Vegeta caught up with the woman, and smacked her into a rock. Wham!</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Your opponent is me!&rdquo; Nameless shouted, punching Vegeta&rsquo;s face so hard, that he was knocked down.</p></p>

<p><p>His body skidded the ground. Doosh doosh. Vegeta stood up. &ldquo;Not bad. What is your name, Rebel?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I am not a Rebel. And I have no name.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No name?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;If you must call me something, call me Nameless.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Nameless?&rdquo; Vegeta thought that name sounded familiar. &ldquo;Is it possible that you&rsquo;re&#8230;you&rsquo;re the warrior rumored to have killed several first class soldiers, and then disappeared without a trace?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmmph. You can think what you want.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>(There&rsquo;s no doubt about it. He is the rogue warrior. What a rare chance I get to run into someone like him. I&rsquo;m sure King Neflite has a high price on this guy&rsquo;s head.) Vegeta smiled. &ldquo;It does not matter whether you&rsquo;re a Rebel or not. You helped them. Which means you are one.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is the reason why I don&rsquo;t like Loyalists.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The two warriors charged and attacked. Wham! Wham! Their movements were fast and blurred. The rocks around them broke apart. Wham!</p></p>

<p><p>After some hits, they landed.</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta: &ldquo;Listen, I just killed Jeremiah Florencia. If you don&rsquo;t want to end up the same way, then surrender!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nameless: &ldquo;Argh. Another reason why I don&rsquo;t like Loyalists.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They charged beams and fired. Froooom! The power struggle was a good one, it was difficult for both to keep up. But Vegeta&rsquo;s beam overcame Nameless&rsquo;s and he got hit against a boulder. Wham. He was fried.</p></p>

<p><p>Nameless got up and laughed.</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s so funny?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d have to use my trump card so soon.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Trump card?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Watch and learn!&rdquo; Nameless transformed into a super sayan.</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta: &ldquo;No way!! He&rsquo;s a super sayan? How can this be?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Surprised?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh. I admit, you did surprise me. But you should never use your trump card until the end. The very end.&rdquo; Vegeta proceeded to take off his cape, scouter, and sayan suit. Now he was wearing only a shirt and sweat pants.</p></p>

<p><p>Nameless: &ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta smiled, and his teeth grew two fangs. His whole body transformed. When he was done, he was a big, white dinosaur-like creature with spikes on his back. His skin was scaly and rough.</p></p>

<p><p>Now, it was Nameless&rsquo;s turn to be shocked. &ldquo;What is the meaning of this?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, warrior? Are you surprised?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This kind of transformation is not possible for a&#8230;sayan. You can&rsquo;t be a sayan!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You are right. I am not a sayan.&rdquo; Vegeta took a step forward. &ldquo;I belong to an ancient race that is more powerful than sayans. I am now a creature called a <strong>Sith</strong>.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nameless grunted and charged.</p></p>

<p><p>The three watchers were shocked by the sudden shift in power.</p></p>

<p><p>Radus: &ldquo;Wow&#8230;unbelievable!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus: &ldquo;That guy&#8230;he made Vegeta turn into that form&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Leozack: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s reached the level of super sayan? And Vegeta has a secret of his own? This is so unreal.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nameless punched Vegeta&rsquo;s stomach and uppercut him in the chin. Kapow. He kept hitting like crazy, as Vegeta was a bigger target. Doosh doosh doosh. He slammed him against a mountain. Wham. Nameless backed off, and fired a blast.</p></p>

<p><p>But Sith wasn&rsquo;t done yet. He was still alive, and had an angry look in its face.</p></p>

<p><p>Nameless fired a golden beam. Vegeta blocked effortlessly, then fired a red beam. It hit the super sayan&rsquo;s arm, and he screamed in pain. &ldquo;Aaaah!&rdquo; He fired ball on the ground, smoke came up, and he flew outta there.</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta: &ldquo;He got away.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>And so, that was the end of the fight. Back to reality now, Nameless was bandaging his wound. He swore he&rsquo;d kill that bastard Vegeta one day. When they meet again. Apparently, super sayan wasn&rsquo;t enough. He needed to reach a new level of power. Something beyond a super sayan. But is it possible?</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita started to confront the cyborgs as they appeared one by one. At first it was trivial, one shows up, and you blow him up. But then waves of two and three appeared. Margarita, to their surprise, did well, except she was clumsier than Jerrell.</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita: &ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The cyborg fired. Margrit ducked while running, and punched its stomach. Thud. The cyborg punched, Margrit blurred, and appeared behind the cyborg. She kicked it in the head, and its head fell off. Wham!</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Not bad&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus was more surprised. &ldquo;Amazing&#8230;she is doing pretty well for someone like her. She truly is Jeremiah&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, three cyborgs showed up. Margrit attacked the one in the middle. But cyborg B got in her way. She punched, B blocked, and punched her down.</p></p>

<p><p>A fired its laser, Margrit sprang up and jumped away. Suddenly, C appeared behind her, and kicked her down.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oof!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Margarita! Damn&#8230;perhaps we spoke too soon?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit got up. &ldquo;Damn&#8230;I can&rsquo;t even beat level one&#8230;what good am I?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell left the Control Room and went to her aide.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Brother?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright, you did well enough.&rdquo; He finished off the remaining cyborgs.</p></p>

<p><p>[ Level 1: CLEAR ]</p></p>

<p><p>In the empty room, the three of them talked. &ldquo;You two did very well.&rdquo; Lotus said, smiling. And he meant it.</p></p>

<p><p>But Margrit didn&rsquo;t take the compliment well. She knew she did badly. Her brother had to save her ass at the end.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Margarita,&rdquo; Lotus said, touching her head. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, you&rsquo;ll get there. Jerrell just passed level one. Level two will be harder. I estimate it will take you about two weeks before getting to level two. But that&rsquo;s enough for today. Let us get some rest.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell left.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Master Lotus?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How long will it take for me to finish level one?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;A little longer.&rdquo; Then he left.</p></p>

<p><p>A little longer? she thought. That wasn&rsquo;t good enough. Voices start to haunt her. The words &lsquo;weak&rsquo; and &lsquo;weakling&rsquo; kept on circling her head. Her previous teacher called her weak. Vegeta called her weak. And many others called her the same. She hated that word. But what&rsquo;s worse&#8230;they might be true.</p></p>

<p><p>The Florencia brother and sister get to share a room. They slept on the opposite sides of the room. Jerrell tossed about, and woke up. He saw Margrit&rsquo;s sleeping bag and it was empty. Maybe she went to the bathroom. He had to pee too. So he got up and walked down the hallway, yawning.</p></p>

<p><p>Well, he just finished level three. Making good progress. And he was proud of himself. When he got to the bathroom, the door was slightly ajar. He knocked. &ldquo;Margarita, hurry up! I drank a lot of water today.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>No response.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Margarita. I&rsquo;m not kidding. Hurry up.&rdquo; Frustrated, he pushed the door open, and to his surprise, the bathroom was empty. &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; If his sis isn&rsquo;t in the bathroom, then where is she in the middle of the night. Suddenly, he gasped. Could it be?</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell hurried over to the Control Room. From the window, he saw Margarita fighting the cyborgs. She was fighting intensely, and although he could not see the expression on her face from up there, he knew she was angry. He looked at the computer display.</p></p>

<p><p>[ Level 1: CLEAR ]</p></p>

<p><p>[ ]</p></p>

<p><p>[ Level: 2 ]</p></p>

<p><p>[ Terrain: Forest ]</p></p>

<p><p>(No way!) he thought. (She&rsquo;s at level two already?)</p></p>

<p><p>The cyborgs all charged at her. She waited, and collected energy, then released it all in one bang. The explosion wiped out all cyborgs in the area. And the second wave came.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell was honestly surprised. So she&rsquo;s been doing this every night. That&rsquo;s why she passed level one and two. For some reason, he was smiling, even though she&rsquo;s catching up to him. Maybe she <strong>does</strong> have what it takes to be an elite soldier.</p></p>

<p><p>And thus, Jerrell knew what to expect every night. If sometimes he wakes up in the middle of the night, and he sees Margrit&rsquo;s sleeping bag empty, he knew where she&rsquo;d be. I&rsquo;ve got a lot of catching up to do, he thought to himself.</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="07">07: A New Friend. </span></p></center>



<p> <p>Time flies by fast. <strong>Four years</strong> have passed since the passing of Order 66. Within the grand palace in Ethiopia, Neflite waited, along with his two rows of subordinates.</p></p>

<p><p>Jarus stepped out of the line and kneeled. &ldquo;Your highness, we have been making tremendous progress. We have occupied 40% of the land in <strong>Mesatopia</strong>. At the rate we are going, we will have the whole continent occupied in no time.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Neflite: &ldquo;Excellent. Next up, Nimbus.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus stepped out of the line and bowed. &ldquo;Sire. We have the Rebels at large in <strong>Trea</strong>.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Neflite: &ldquo;Do they have a chance of winning?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus: &ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Chatter amongst the crowd.</p></p>

<p><p>Neflite: &ldquo;Good. I have high hopes for you, Nimbus. You are the third strongest sayan on our planet. Vegeta is the second strongest. You two alone should be able to dominate <strong>more</strong> than 50% of Arlia. We have the resources. We have the power. The Rebels have nothing.&rdquo; Then, he pressed a button on his chair. A holographic screen of Vegeta showed up in the middle of the room. &ldquo;Vegeta, what is your progress?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sire, our forces are strong and concentrated in Mesatomia. As we speak, we are destroying a Rebel camp.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Excellent. I expect to hear good news from you.&rdquo; The holographic screen was gone. Neflite was happy. Everything&rsquo;s going well.</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia: &ldquo;Who was that, brother?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta: &ldquo;That was his highness the king. He is expecting big things from us.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia was sitting on her brother&rsquo;s shoulder as usual. Vegeta was standing on a cliff, watching the battle below. Explosions were everywhere.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Okay Sephia, I am going down there. You stay put.&rdquo; He put her down.</p></p>

<p><p>Sephia: &ldquo;Awww, I never get to have any fun!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get your chance.&rdquo; Vegeta flew down.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta reached the camp, and soldiers saw him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&#8230;It&rsquo;s Vegeta!&rdquo; They fired at him. Bang. Bang. Vegeta flew past them, and even his wind nearly blew them off their feet, then he turned around, and fired energy balls.</p></p>

<p><p>Boom, boom, boom.</p></p>

<p><p>Not far away&#8230;</p></p>

<p><p>Kemia: &ldquo;They&rsquo;re on to us.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus: &ldquo;Damn it. How long must we keep fighting like this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The girl strapped on her fighting shoes, and fixed her pants. She fixed up her gloves, and they fit perfectly. She adjusted her light combat suit, and she&rsquo;s ready for some action.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Alright, bring it on!&rdquo; she shouted.</p></p>

<p><p>[ Level: 9 ]</p></p>

<p><p>[ Terrain: Swamp ]</p></p>

<p><p>Cyborgs appeared and got close to the girl. But she didn&rsquo;t move. They jumped and attacked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get this show on the road!&rdquo; <strong>Margarita</strong> shouted. She powered up, and released a vertical beam, and all the cyborgs that touched her got incinerated.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, robotic spiders appeared. They fired sticky web things at her, and she dodged. Then she flew up, and so did the spiders. She dodged their beams and fired energy balls. Boom. Took one down. One came from behind. She flew up, stepped on the spider&rsquo;s head, and knocked it to the ground. Wham. It blew up. Spiders came from all different angles.</p></p>

<p><p><strong>Jerrell</strong>: &ldquo;Wow, she&rsquo;s pretty damn good.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;Of course. She is making good progress. Excellent progress, I might add. You&rsquo;re at level 10. She is at 9 already.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;I know. She&rsquo;s been working hard to keep up with me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita screamed and yelled as she hit the cyborgs dead on.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon! Bring it on!! Is that all ya got?!&rdquo; Smash. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon!&rdquo; Smash. The level Z cyborgs were totally trashed.</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;I see an aggressiveness in her I haven&rsquo;t seen before. Each level in the program is not just a level of skill. But it&rsquo;s also a mindset.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;Yes, and I know it is something that I neglected to mention. I did not want you to know yet. But these levels reveal parts of you that you did not know yourself?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Like a personality test?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sort of. It is like a personality test of war. It prepares you for dangerous situations.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Smash. Another robot destroyed. Margarita charged at one of them, and hit it dead on in the stomach, and her fist went inside it. She grabbed the circuits and other stuff and pulled it out, as the robot tried to grab her. Then she just punched its face, denting its head. It fell.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;If I dare say&#8230;she&rsquo;s actually&#8230;enjoying this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;Oh, I have noticed that too.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;And here I was, thinking she hates war. But something about fighting gets her blood pumping. Competition gets her excited.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well, she <strong>is</strong> a sayan after all.&rdquo; Lotus said, touching his beard.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh. Yeah.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Finally, she blew up all the enemies.</p></p>

<p><p>[ Level 9: Clear ]</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell and Margarita walked past each other. &ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t bad.&rdquo; Jerrell said. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll do better.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They continued walking; Jerrell went to the empty room, Margrit to the Control Room.</p></p>

<p><p>[ Level: 10 ]</p></p>

<p><p>[ Terrain: Wasteland ]</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;At level 10, the cyborgs become a little bit harder. They are no longer Class Z cyborgs, but Class Y.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, really?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The most difficult class of cyborgs is <strong>Class S</strong>. You&rsquo;ll get to fight him at the last level.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell waited for the cyborgs to come. They looked meaner and badder. Jerrell charged electric energy all over his body, and released it. &ldquo;<strong>Electric Storm</strong>!&rdquo; All the cyborgs were short-circuited and fried.</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;Amazing.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Wow&#8230;Jerrell is good at creating techniques. This one&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It is a storm of electric currents. It has to be at least 10,000 volts. No single person can survive that.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Jerrell is a master at planning and preparation. I don&rsquo;t think anyone can beat him when it comes to that. I&rsquo;ve seen him practicing that new move outside in the woods. But I&rsquo;ve never seen it perfected.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The three sat down and they ate breakfast. It was a typical morning, and this scene was just like when the three first met. They kneeled around the table and drank tea and ate pancakes. They&rsquo;d look outside the window, which was just a rectangular hole on the wall. The outline of the mountains could be seen, the sun shined bright and the sky was mild blue and yellow.</p></p>

<p><p>These four years have been pretty peaceful for the Florencia children. But they are no longer children. They&rsquo;ve grown up much during these years, and Lotus was happy that at least for now they have a childhood worth remembering.</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita walked about the streets of Memphis, looking at the stores. She hummed as she walked with her hands folded behind her.</p></p>

<p><p>A girl her size just bumped into her, and kept running.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Ouch. Watch it, you moron! Sheesh, people these days.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She happened to come across this jewelry store. &ldquo;Oooh...&rdquo; she said, staring at a bunch of shiny items on a table.</p></p>

<p><p>The seller was an old lady in with a cloth over her head and body. The store was just four wooden poles with a large blanket over it.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit walked towards the table.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Do you like what you see?&rdquo; the old lady asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes. These jewels are very pretty.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes they are. Say, pretty girl, I&rsquo;ll give you a discount on one of them.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Really? Thank you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Which one do you like?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ummm...&rdquo; Margrit chose carefully. &ldquo;How about this one?&rdquo; she said, picking up a green stone. The gem was oval-shaped and there&rsquo;s a part sticking out in the center.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So you like that one?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. What is it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It is a good luck charm. Legend says it was worn by a once brave warrior. He had to battle the king of demons in order to save his village. The warrior had to go through the <strong>Valley of the Dead</strong>, place filled with evil spirits and dark energy. The charm protected him and guided him safely through the valley.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an interesting story.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Whoever is in possession of this will have good luck.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit thought for a second, and then said: &ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;ll take it. How much?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Thirty-two <strong>UU</strong>&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; She handed her three tens and two ones. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My child...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit turned silent.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I have a feeling you are not from round here, are you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I know, child. I also know you are about to face great danger. I just hope this charm can help you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What are you talking about? You&rsquo;re spouting non-sense.&rdquo; Margrit said, leaving.</p></p>

<p><p>As she walked, the old lady shouted: &ldquo;My predictions are never wrong, child! Be careful!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Sheesh, what a freaky old lady. What&rsquo;s up with people nowadays?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Just then, she heard the sound of a woman&rsquo;s scream from the woods. She hurried over there.</p></p>

<p><p>Three men were ganging up on a girl.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit hid behind a tree. &ldquo;What? It&rsquo;s that girl who bumped into me earlier. Is this why she&rsquo;s in a hurry?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Gangster A: &ldquo;Well, you brat, where&rsquo;s our money?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ehhh&#8230;well, you see, I don&rsquo;t quite have it yet.&rdquo; <strong>Malin</strong> said, chuckling nervously. She was a tan-skinned girl with red hair. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you give me one more week, please?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Gangster A: &ldquo;One more week? Are ya shittin&rsquo; me? We&rsquo;ve given you enough time. You don&rsquo;t have the ability to pay, do you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Gangster B: &ldquo;Boss, don&rsquo;t believe her. She doesn&rsquo;t got no money. She just stallin&rsquo; for time so she can high-tail outta here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not true! I swear to God I&rsquo;ll get the money.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Gangster B: &ldquo;Quit lying, ya bitch? You don&rsquo;t got no money. You&rsquo;re going to have to pay with your body.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Gangster A: &ldquo;Not a bad idea&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;Wait a minute&#8230;can&rsquo;t we talk about this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Margarita ran at them and punched gangster C in the face. Doosh.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What the?!&rdquo; Malin said. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Gangster A: &ldquo;A friend of yours?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know her!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Gangster B took out a knife and swiped it. Margrit dodged, then grabbed his arm and threw him down. Wham. Gangster A ran at her, she kneed him in the stomach, then flew up, lifting him by his shirt.</p></p>

<p><p>He looked down. &ldquo;Yipes, don&rsquo;t drop me, please!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Picking on women? Is that how you thieves work nowadays?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kill me, please! Have mercy.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit smiled. &ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; She threw him into the trees, and he landed on one of the branches.</p></p>

<p><p>Malin flew up to Margrit&rsquo;s altitude. &ldquo;Hey you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: (She can fly too?)</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hey you! What&rsquo;d you do that for?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ummm, excuse me? I just saved your ass.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask for your help.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What? You ungrateful little&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I had it all handled. I wasn&rsquo;t about to let these perverts touch me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Are you a&#8230;sayan?&rdquo; Margrit asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sayan? I don&rsquo;t know whatchu talking about. I&rsquo;m outta here.&rdquo; Malin flew away.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; she yelled. But she&rsquo;s gone already.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well that was stupid.&rdquo; Margrit mumbled to herself. She just saved someone&rsquo;s life, and did she get a thank you? No. She got yelled at. No appreciation at all. Anyway, it&rsquo;s time for training.</p></p>

<p><p>The background turned to that of a ruined city. Cyborgs appeared, and Margrit let out her fury. Wham! Smash!</p></p>

<p><p>Master Lotus walked into Jerrell&rsquo;s room with some tea. &ldquo;Thank you, master.&rdquo; he said, looking at some maps of Arlia.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; Lotus inquired.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s just some maps of the war. I am receiving this information from a friend in the war.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I see. You&rsquo;re making battle plans?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Jerrell replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see what the different scenarios that can happen are.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My my, you are planning as if you are fighting the war.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh. Technically I am. I know I am going back one day.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The same girl from before, Malin, looked at the temple. She gasped and went inside.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;May I help you?&rdquo; Lotus said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I am looking for Master Lotus.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You are looking at him.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin kneeled and bowed in respect. &ldquo;Master Lotus! I&rsquo;ve finally found you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My name is Malin. And I am a Rebel from Arlia. Because of the purification, my parents were captured and I was forced to flee.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell was listening in on their conversation from the hallway. (She&rsquo;s a refuge, just like me?)</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;Jerrell, why don&rsquo;t you come in and introduce yourself?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Busted. But how did Lotus know he&rsquo;s hiding? Was he sensed out?</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;Malin, this is Jerrell. This is Malin.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They shook hands.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Pleased to meet you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The pleasure is mine.&rdquo; Jerrell said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;By any chance, are you Jerrell Florencia?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ummm, yeah.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You are?! So your father is Jeremiah Florencia?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard so much about him. It&rsquo;s a shame I never get to meet him in person.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&#8230;no one can see him again.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;Alright, let us go to the training facility. I have one more person to introduce you to.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>So they went to the Control Room. Malin was surprised to see Margrit fighting robots. (That girl&#8230;she&rsquo;s in this temple too?)</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my sister, Margarita.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: (Jerrell&rsquo;s sister? Margarita?)</p></p>

<p><p>Neflite was done explaining the war situation to his son, Neflite II. He was now sound asleep, and Neflite rested in his chair by himself. Just then, a being came out from the dark.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;D-Dark Spectre? What brings you here?&rdquo; Everytime Spectre visits him, he gets the chills.</p></p>

<p><p>Dark Spectre&rsquo;s face could not be seen, it was hidden behind a black helmet-like mask, like one that a motorcyclist uses. Maybe that&rsquo;s what Neflite finds most creepy about him, the fact that he&rsquo;s never seen his true face before. Spectre&rsquo;s humanoid form was covered by metallic armor, including metallic shoulder pads, a chest plate, and metallic boots. His breathing was loud and clearly audible.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I am here to inquire about the war, of course.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh yes, the war...&rdquo; Neflite said nervously. &ldquo;We are very successful. The rebels are losing as we speak.&rdquo;</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="08">08: Released Potential.</span></p></center> 

<p> <p>The Intergalactic War all started when some power-hungry warlords in Murai wanted more land. They made a sudden attack in Macedonion, and assassinated their leader. The Macedonions were enraged. They sought the help of the Masadonions, and counter-attacked. And that was the official start of the war. They have been fighting ever since then, each side enlisting more and more planets for aid.</p></p>

<p><p>Certain planets supported solely the Empire or the Rebels, but in certain planets, the people were divided on their views. Some joined the Empire, some joined the Rebels, and thus civil wars erupted. This war truly tested the morale and honor of every single person alive. But the Empire&rsquo;s trump card, Arlia, has officially started its civil war four years ago. (Although the Loyalists do not consider it a war, but as a Purification).</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Bring it on!&rdquo; Margrit shouted excitedly.</p></p>

<p><p>Cyborgs came towards her, ready to kill. She got ready.</p></p>

<p><p>Bam! Wham! Pow! Klunk! She finished off the cyborgs one by one. They were now scrap metal. The background changed back to the four walls.</p></p>

<p><p>The three members of the party went to the training room.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: (That girl&#8230;it&rsquo;s her.)</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;Let me introduce you-&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit pointed at Malin. &ldquo;I know you, you&rsquo;re that girl from before.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve met?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So, did you finally get the nerve to come here to thank me?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin grunted. &ldquo;Grrrr&#8230;like I told you before, I had it all handled.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Heh, yeah right.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus and Jerrell looked at each other, confused.</p></p>

<p><p>As the girls kept on arguing, Lotus interrupted. &ldquo;Ahem. As I was saying, this is Margarita, and this is Malin.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They shook hands, but the hand shake was extra long. Margrit tried to squeeze her hand, and Malin tried the same. Finally, they let each other go and smiled.</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;Well, I must say, what you did down here wasn&rsquo;t half bad. You blew up those cyborgs like they&rsquo;re garbage. But then again, I&rsquo;ve seen better.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Oh really? Would you care to try it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;Is that a challenge?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Do you accept?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin shrugged. &ldquo;Sure, why not? Looks fun.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>So now Malin stayed behind, the other three went to the computer.</p></p>

<p><p>(So this is the training system developed in Macedonion. I&rsquo;ve never actually seen the completed product myself.) &ldquo;Alright, it&rsquo;s time to start. I think I&rsquo;ll start at level 10.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;Level 10?! Malin, I recommend that everyone who&rsquo;s not familiar with this system should start at level 1.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;What? Level 1? Bah, that&rsquo;s for amateurs. I&rsquo;m the type who skips ahead.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita noticed something about Malin - she&rsquo;s arrogant just like herself. And she&rsquo;s starting to like her. &ldquo;Okay. If she wants level 10, then let&rsquo;s give her level 10.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s extremely dangerous!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin pointed at herself. &ldquo;Danger&rsquo;s my middle name. I can handle it. Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll be responsible for whatever happens.&rdquo;<br>  Margarita set the computer program.</p></p>

<p><p>[ Level: 10 ]</p></p>

<p><p>[ Terrain: Apocalypse ]</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;This doesn&rsquo;t look like a good idea.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus and Jerrell were shocked by Margrit&rsquo;s confidence in this girl. But they let her try it anyway.</p></p>

<p><p>The training started. Cyborgs charged at Malin full speed. Malin smiled confidently as if she can&rsquo;t lose. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s <strong>show time</strong>!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Smash! Klunk! Smash! Malin kicked and jumped away, and kicked another one, and jumped away. Then she flew to the air and formed a shield. She fired beams in multiple directions and blew up the cyborgs.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Amazing.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, a robot&rsquo;s laser nearly hit her, she dodged, and it scratched her arm. &ldquo;Aaah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Everyone was surprise, even Margrit, who didn&rsquo;t say a word. Malin got angry and fired a full blast the cyborg. Kaboom! The terrain was damaged beyond recognition.</p></p>

<p><p>[ Level 10: CLEAR ]</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit was satisfied. &ldquo;So, she cleared level 10 on her first try. Not bad. She&rsquo;s an experienced fighter.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;But still, it takes time to get used to the program. But she just passed level 10 in one shot. That is pretty exceptional.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The three walked to Malin.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Good job. You did great.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin was staring at the floor, and they couldn&rsquo;t see her eyes. &ldquo;No I didn&rsquo;t. I messed up. I nearly lost my life.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Hey now, it wasn&rsquo;t that bad.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;Yes it was.&rdquo; She ran away.</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;What a strange one.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit watched intently as she ran away. What are these two thinking that Jerrell and Lotus does not know of?</p></p>

<p><p>While out in the open, Malin stood in front of a vertical piece of wood. The piece of wood she&rsquo;s practiced with for some time. Jerrell watched from a distance, making sure not to get discovered.</p></p>

<p><p>Malin kicked the wood angrily. Thud. Thud. &ldquo;Yaaah!&rdquo; Thud.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell was curious at her irrational anger. Why is she angry? She passed level 10 on the program. She should be happy.</p></p>

<p><p>Thud. &ldquo;Yaaah!&rdquo; Thud. Then she breathed hard. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe I was so careless.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, a robot&rsquo;s laser nearly hit her, she dodged, and it scratched her arm. &ldquo;Aaah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That one mistake could have cost me my life in a real battle. Those bastards in Arlia aren&rsquo;t amateurs. It is intense over there. I have to keep in shape! What is wrong with me? Why am I not strong enough?!&rdquo; She punched the wood furiously, pretending it&rsquo;s her enemy. &ldquo;Why am I not strong enough! Argh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>When she was done exerting herself, she ran and flew away.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell walked towards the piece of wood. It was very old and battered. He could see the marks made. But it wasn&rsquo;t from today. It was from years of beating. Jerrell suddenly respected her more.</p></p>

<p><p>So there are other people like him who are orphans of the war. She&rsquo;s also a victim of the war. It was beyond her control. Who knows what happened to her parents? She&rsquo;s probably very angry, and saved up her rage. And she&rsquo;s worked hard. She passed a difficult level of the program, and she&rsquo;s not happy, but enraged at one little mistake. Is this undying determination what Margarita sees in her?</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus sipped his tea. &ldquo;My children, we need to have a talk.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They got closer to him. &ldquo;About what? The war?&rdquo; Jerrell asked eagerly.</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;My children...I know that one day you will complete your training and leave me to go back to fight in the war. Revenge is a very powerful emotion. And you, as sayans, cannot ignore it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit tightened her fist.</p></p>

<p><p>The old man closed his eyes, and then opened them. &ldquo;This war has been dragged out for a long, long time.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How long?&rdquo; Jerrell asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;For ninety years. Almost a hundred.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The teens were both shocked. &ldquo;Ninety years?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It all began in a planet in the eastern sector called <strong>Murai</strong>. This is said to be the home planet of the <strong>Dark Empire</strong>. Nothing good ever comes out of that planet. The tyrants at Murai wanted more and more power. They are the ones who experimented with <strong>dark energy</strong>, something that should never be tampered with. The tyrants formed a committee - they call it the Council - and they are the masterminds behind the war. They plan everything and carry out the orders. The war started when Murai soldiers assassinated a Macedonion president. They wanted planet Macedonion badly, because it will give them a territorial advantage. The Macedonions and Murains have had a grudge for a while. So it&rsquo;s natural they started the war. And after that, other planets joined in.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;And then Arlia joined in?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;Yes, but not by choice. The Empire&rsquo;s leader, <strong>Dark Spectre</strong>&#8230;he forced the king to carry out something called Order 66.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Dark Spectre? He&rsquo;s the one leading the Empire?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes. The Council listens to him. He has absolute control over every decision made in the Empire. He is also a mysterious person, and is said to be the strongest warrior in the universe. No one who has ever fought him survived.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;What a scary person&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;And unfortunately, the Rebels in Arlia are losing.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The siblings were shocked. &ldquo;Losing?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very bad!&rdquo; Margrit said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No kidding, it&rsquo;s very bad. The rebels have lost all their posts in Ethiopia, and they are losing on other continents as well. The Loyalists have certain key players. Amongst them is the king himself, also, General Jarus, Nimbus, and General Vegeta-&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;V-Vegeta?&rdquo; Margrit repeated painfully. &ldquo;F-Father...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Margrit? Are you okay?&rdquo; her bro asked with concern.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Father&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Da-daddy!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell could no longer contain her. She was powering up and out of control. &ldquo;Sis, calm down!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Whoosh! In a flash, she charged at Vegeta.</p></p>

<p><p>Whack! She kicked him in the face. He didn&rsquo;t know what hit him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Daddy...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jeremiah: &ldquo;What are you doing here? Run Margrit! Get out of here!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;No, I want to stay with you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta recovered angrily. &ldquo;Why you little...so you&rsquo;re Jeremiah&rsquo;s daughter, eh? Owww how cute. It&rsquo;s a shame you have to die so young.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Run now, Margarita. Go!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t leave you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Run! Get out of here!&rdquo; he shouted.</p></p>

<p><p>So she ran. Vegeta appeared in front of her. She gasped. &ldquo;Hahahahaha! Where are you going, little one?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta gathered energy and fired a beam. Jeremiah jumped in front of her and grabbed her. The beam hit his back and he screamed. &ldquo;Aaaahhh!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Daddy!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Run...Mar-grit...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Daddy!&rdquo; she shouted with tears.</p></p>

<p><p>He collapsed in front of her very eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta: &ldquo;Ahahahaha! That&rsquo;s the end of Jeremiah. What a brave and noble man. Too bad. You died. Another rebel casualty.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jeremiah crawled. &ldquo;Run&#8230;h-hurry&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...&rdquo; Jerrell muttered with tears.</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta opened his palm and gathered energy, preparing to blast Margrit. Jerrell charged at him, and he looked to the side. &ldquo;Another one?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell kicked his shoulder and made him fall. He quickly grabbed Margrit&rsquo;s arm and ran. &ldquo;Daddy...daddy...&rdquo; she said, looking back.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Margrit, we have to worry about ourselves!&rdquo; Jerrell shouted.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly Vegeta appeared in front of them.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yipes!&rdquo; the boy yelled.</p></p>

<p><p>It looked like the end of them now. Frooom!</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Vegeta killed my father...&rdquo; Suddenly, she got a huge headache. She went towards the window and grabbed her head and screamed.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Margrit are you okay?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;Margarita? What is the matter?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She kept punching the wall, breaking the wood, and screamed madly. Then she panted for breath, and collapsed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Margarita! Margarita!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Master Lotus put an ice pack on her head. Margrit was in the sleeping bag, tucked up. She moaned as the ice bag cooled her forehead.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Will she be okay?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just mental exhaustion. She will be fine in a couple of hours.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Thank goodness.&rdquo; Jerrell said, looking at his sister. He can&rsquo;t blame her, she&rsquo;s been through so much. He himself was there when he saw what Margrit saw. He was able to handle it well, but she wasn&rsquo;t. Margrit might act tough, but she&rsquo;s emotionally unstable.</p></p>

<p><p>They left the room.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Jerrell, tell me the details of how your father was killed. I know it is painful, but it could be the source of Margrit&rsquo;s condition.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This was what happened...Vegeta fired at my sister, and my father blocked it for her...and...he died right in front of her eyes. Is that it? Is that why when you mentioned the name Vegeta, she ended up like this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmmmm...&rdquo; Lotus wondered, touching his beard. &ldquo;So that is what happened. Poor child. She must have a traumatic shock from seeing her own father die in front of her, and she was helpless to do anything about it. In cases like these, I&rsquo;m afraid, it could be very serious. It could stick with her for the rest of her life.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well&#8230;what about me? Will it affect me as well?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You are emotionally stronger than your sister. You have a calm attitude that is essential in war. That&rsquo;s one of your assets. Jerrell, take good care of your sister.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I will. Master Lotus?&rdquo; Jerrell asked as they were walking along the streets of Memphis.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes Jerrell?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;When will our training be complete?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Patience, Jerrell, patience. A warrior&rsquo;s training is never complete. He always seeks to become stronger, no matter how strong he currently is. Well, let me give you a more simple answer: once you have reached level 20 on the machine and beat it, then I can say for sure, your training is complete, at least with me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wow, level 20 must be really hard. I&rsquo;m having a tough time on level 15.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You still have a long way to go.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit woke up with cold sweat. Her headache was still existent, but not as strong. For several minutes, she stood by the window, lost in thought, not knowing what to do. She decided to go back to the training room.</p></p>

<p><p>She set the level to 12 and went downstairs. This time, the background was a jungle. She was surrounded by boulders and trees.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well? Where are the enemies? I&rsquo;m waiting.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Cyborgs showed up from the trees.</p></p>

<p><p>She got into position. They started shooting lasers but many shots missed. She dodged and fired quick energy balls at each one and blew them up. Boom! Boom!</p></p>

<p><p>One of them leaped at her from a curve. She punched it and her fist went through its stomach. All its insides fell out. She tossed the body at another cyborg, knocking it down.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yahhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Another one came for her. She kicked it away. She powered up and fired a beam at one of the cyborgs, knocking it against a boulder. The whole place shook.</p></p>

<p><p>In the Control Room, a carelessly abandoned cup of coffee was left on the control panel. The shaking from the battle caused it to fall and spill on the buttons, causing them to short circuit.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yaaah!&rdquo; Margrit screamed. She broke all the cyborgs into pieces. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? That&rsquo;s all you got?&rdquo; she said, acting all tough.</p></p>

<p><p>The broken cyborgs vanished.</p></p>

<p><p>The control panel displayed: [ Warning: Level 20: Warning ]</p></p>

<p><p>Eight cyborgs surrounded Margrit in eight directions. &ldquo;Alright, finally.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She shot an energy ball at one of them, it jumped, evaded. She was quite surprised at its speed. Behind her two cyborgs charged. She leaped and punched, the cyborg dodged and the other kicked her in the stomach, bouncing her on the ground. A, D and E shot lasers at her. She back flipped to a safe distance, but got hit. Lasers were literally every where.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How come they seem so much tougher? I thought this is level 13?&rdquo; Lasers came at her. She jumped. &ldquo;How did their level increase so much?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>As she pondered, she got burned on the back.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aaaah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Cyborg A punched her face. Pow! She kicked its chest. Klunk! A grabbed her foot and swings her like a fan. Whoosh! It let go, letting her crash into the ground. With her face in the dirt, she forced herself up.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So, that&rsquo;s...how you w-wanna play? Bring it on!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The eight cyborgs approached.</p></p>

<p><p>As Jerrell was shopping, he felt something was wrong. It was as if a lightning bolt struck his mind. He gasped and stood still.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Margarita&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about her so much. You need to let your mind off these things.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in danger.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus ran after him. &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to explain it, but I just <strong>know</strong>!It&rsquo;s a gut feeling, call it an instinct if you want. But my sister is in trouble!&rdquo; He ran back to the temple.</p></p>

<p><p>Boom! Cyborg D fell apart.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s next?&rdquo; Margrit shouted.</p></p>

<p><p>H shot an energy ball, Margrit formed a shield but the ball pushed her back. She fired the Energy Blast, completely annihilating #8.</p></p>

<p><p>B made an electric attack and fried her. Margrit screamed like hell and collapsed.</p></p>

<p><p>Things really don&rsquo;t look good now. There&rsquo;s still six left, all at the highest level, a training mode Margrit wasn&rsquo;t prepared for. Will this training machine be the end of her life?</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Never...you will never defeat me.&rdquo; She crawled up.</p></p>

<p><p>The cyborgs just watched her with their lifeless eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>She wiped blood from her mouth. &ldquo;Come on.&rdquo; she hissed.</p></p>

<p><p>A, C, B and G leaped at her. Margarita powered up like she never did before. Energy bursted out of her body, forming streams around her, like a body on white fire. Bam! They were destroyed.</p></p>

<p><p>Now, only E and F were left. With their AI, they know they had to be defensive. They stepped back.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>E fired a laser. Margrit fired the <strong>Wrath Beam</strong>, killing E. #6 charged and punched. Margrit dodged and punched it against a boulder. #6 shot a laser, Margrit jumped and kicked its head off. It rolled on the ground. Klunk klunk klunk.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit started to walk away. Parts of the cyborgs floated in the air and combined together. Margrit turned around, shocked. The robotic parts began to form a head, then a body, then arms and legs. Within minutes, it was a completely new cyborg, bigger and fiercer.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to be kidding me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The supreme cyborg landed on the ground with a thud. Margarita hesitated, then attacked. Pow! She punched its face. It didn&rsquo;t even bulge. <strong>Cyborg S</strong> punched her and she fell. It lifted her by the head and threw her into a lake. Splash.</p></p>

<p><p>Cyborg S approached the lake carefully.</p></p>

<p><p>While in the lake, Margarita saw herself - a mirror reflection. Her reflection was her when she was four years ago. Still a kid. A weak kid.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, no, that&rsquo;s wrong! You&rsquo;re just too weak.&rdquo; said her teacher.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re weak!&rdquo; said another warrior.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re weak, just like your father.&rdquo; said Vegeta.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a weakling!&rdquo; said Prince Neflite.</p></p>

<p><p>Weak! Weakling! Weak.</p></p>

<p><p>(Stop it! Stop it!!)</p></p>

<p><p>Weak! Weakling! Weak.</p></p>

<p><p>(I am not weak! Stop it! I am a sayan!!)</p></p>

<p><p>You&rsquo;re a disgrace to your father.</p></p>

<p><p>(No!)</p></p>

<p><p>Your father died because of you. Because of your incompetence!! Weakling!!</p></p>

<p><p><strong>(NOOOO!!! Shut the hell up!)</strong></p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Margrit popped out and punched its face.</p></p>

<p><p>Meanwhile Jerrell and Lotus ran like hell back to the temple. Almost there.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Die!&rdquo; she shouted.</p></p>

<p><p>Cyborg S revealed a missile and locked on to its target. Margrit blasted the missile into pieces. Cyborg S rocketed to the air and knocked her down.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit stood up and powered up even further. Electric sparks appeared and energy flowed through her body. She waited for S to come, then charged and dug her fist into its stomach, and went through. Kram! She lifted her arm and lifted the cyborg. Then she powered up her hand and blew the cyborg into pieces.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit breathed hard, she was tired and worn out. She had no idea this pushed her over the limit, enabling her to acquire power that she couldn&rsquo;t get any other way.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell and Lotus busted into the training room, yelling her name.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Thank God you&rsquo;re alright, sis.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;What happened to you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Nothing. Nothing happened at all.&rdquo; she said, walking away tiredly.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell went to the Control Room to check what happened. He was dumbfounded by what he saw on the screen.</p></p>

<p><p>[ Level 20: CLEAR ]</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="09">09: A Friend In Need.</span></p></center> 



<p><p>The danger has passed, and Margarita has survived, not knowing what she had accomplished. But memories of the war still linger on. Will these war orphans be able to overcome their past and become strong, or be consumed by the demons of the past?</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell screamed in agony as the enemies kept attacking him. These &ldquo;flying mines&rdquo; came in the form of floating balls - they explode on impact. The mines gathered together in the air, and kept on coming at him. Kaboom! Jerrell powered up to make them explode without touching him. <strong>Kaboom!</strong></p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aaaaaaah!&rdquo; Kaboom!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus was standing in usual spot in the Control Room. He observed Jerrell&rsquo;s movements and power level carefully.</p></p>

<p><p>More mines came at him. He powered up and made them explode. He was wearing out, but he kept on going. &ldquo;Aaaaah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus shouted on the microphone: &ldquo;Jerrell, that&rsquo;s enough. You&rsquo;re tired.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m far from done.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus terminated the program, and the terrain turned back to its natural form, an empty metallic room.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;No, damn it! I can continue. Please!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus was reluctant to do it, but he was afraid his student will get mad at him. &ldquo;Fine, then.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The program resumed.</p></p>

<p><p>[ Level: 18 ]</p></p>

<p><p>[ Terrain: Swamp ]</p></p>

<p><p>The mines appeared in groups, and flew at him.</p></p>

<p><p>(He&rsquo;s trying to skip a few levels. Why is he pushing himself so hard?) Lotus thought. (Could it have something to do with Margarita passing level 20 accidentally?)</p></p>

<p><p>Meanwhile, Malin was still upset over her mistake. She kept hitting the wood as if it offended her. Thud. Thud. She kicked it hard. Thud.</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita watched from a distance. She was wondering why Malin was so intense with training.</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;How long are you planning to spy on me?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit walked towards her. &ldquo;Very good. I suppressed my ki as much as possible, but you were still able to sense me out.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We sayans have a <strong>sixth sense</strong>, but we get so caught up with it we neglect our other five senses. You don&rsquo;t necessarily need to sense someone out to know someone&rsquo;s watching you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I see. You&rsquo;re an interesting person. Is this how you train all the time?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Did you come here just to ask me these questions?&rdquo; Malin went into the woods.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hey wait!&rdquo; Margrit said. &ldquo;How rude!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They went into the woods.</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;Damn it, what do you want?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We have a lot in common, don&rsquo;t we? We&rsquo;re both war orphans. It&rsquo;s natural for people with a common cause to band together. I just want to congratulate you on a job well done with the training program.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;A job well done? You don&rsquo;t have to mock me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Margrit said, a bit confused. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not mocking you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made one little mistake. That mistake could&rsquo;ve cost me my life. How <strong>is</strong> <strong>that</strong></p></p>

<p><p>a job well done?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Uhhh&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The battlefield is cruel. I can&rsquo;t afford to make even one mistake. If I even let my guard down for one second&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Geez, you&rsquo;re taking this a little too seriously, aren&rsquo;t ya? I mean, c&rsquo;mon. All this coming from a girl who trains with a piece of wood?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;And this coming from someone who trains with a video game?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit got ticked off. &ldquo;Oh yeah? Wanna see which training method is better? Care to take me on one on one?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You? Peh. I don&rsquo;t like wasting time. Even with a handicap, you can&rsquo;t beat me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Why you lousy&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Maybe another day.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Are you scared?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Of you? Good one.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So why not a match?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;You know what? Since you have a death wish, I&rsquo;ll grant you your wish!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talking about.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Both warriors powered up. Margrit let out a stream of white energy, Malin charged up red energy.</p></p>

<p><p><strong>Moku</strong> was standing with Lotus in the Control Room, watching Jerrell fight for his life. He was one of Lotus&rsquo;s old comrades.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So, this is the prodigy kid you was telling me about?&rdquo; Moku asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes. I have been training him using this virtual reality machine called the <strong>VR-Combat Simulator</strong>.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What about the other kid?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;She is out on an errand. It&rsquo;s not a good idea to have two people use the Simulator at the same time. It&rsquo;s meant for one person.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I see. And these are all orphans from Arlia?&rdquo; Moku asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;These poor kids. I heard the situation is pretty bad over there.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Both warriors still powered up in the woods. Malin bottled up that energy and ran forward, and expelled that energy into her right hand. Kapow. She punched Margrit in the face. But Margrit didn&rsquo;t budge, her head turned slightly, with Malin&rsquo;s fist in her face.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You call that a punch?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit smacked her hand away, then punched her a dozen times in the stomach, and finished the combo off with a kick in the chest. Doosh.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit wiped the blood off her lips. Malin stood up. &ldquo;Damn you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What? You&rsquo;d think I challenged you if I didn&rsquo;t think I can win?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin charged and they fought. Pak! Pok! Pak! Then they took it to the air - fighting and moving through the trees. Pak! Pok! Pak!</p></p>

<p><p>Malin fired some beams, Margrit dodged. Trees blew up. Margrit counter attacked with beams. Explosions were everywhere.</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus drank some tea, and sensed the battle going on. He looked towards the window. &ldquo;This energy&#8230;those two are going at it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The two sayans kept hitting each other, inflicting pain. Margrit dodged Malin&rsquo;s air kicks, and maneuvered behind her, and kicked her in the back. Wham! Malin turned around and kicked, and Margrit blurred, appeared from the side, and kicked her into a tree. Thud.</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus, as he continued to monitor the battle without actually seeing it, flashed back.</p></p>

<p><p>Master Lotus and his two students kneeled on the floor as he instructed them. &ldquo;I want to comment you on your performances. You two did a good job. And watching your performance from the Simulator, I&rsquo;ve noticed certain habits and certain behaviors that repeat. Margarita-&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, master.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed that you can move around in the air freely without any problems. You actually have an advantage in the air.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell and Margrit listened with all ears.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That is very good, since most people are not. Air combat is extremely difficult, and it takes one many years to master it. Some fighters give up air combat all together, and they just wing it. So you have an edge when it comes to the air. However, flying already consumes a lot of energy. And Margarita, you use up a lot of energy recklessly.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;I do? Well, that&rsquo;s okay. I&rsquo;ve got plenty of reserves.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, every ounce counts. Especially in life and death combat situations. Not being able to do a certain move will be fatal. Stop using your ki so recklessly. You need to plan out your fighting.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Wham! Margrit kept on kicking Malin.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh! Aah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ya give up?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Not by a long shot!&rdquo; Malin charged and punched. Margrit blocked lightning</p></p>

<p><p>fast.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So stop wasting your energy and start saving it up. You fight very aggressively, and if your opponent is advanced, that can be fatal. For some opponents, you might be able to wear them out, but not for more advanced fighters. Your kicking techniques are also very good, especially in mid-air combat. So use them often. You also need to learn how to defend yourself properly.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Thud! Malin let out a furious punching combo, as Margrit blocked in the chest and face area. Thud thud thud. She got slammed into a tree, and went through it, and tree fell down.</p></p>

<p><p>She ended up crashing into a boulder. Wham.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&#8230;was nothing.&rdquo; Margrit said arrogantly.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You think that&rsquo;s nothing? Take this!&rdquo; Malin fired the Energy Blast.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit quickly jumped out of harm&rsquo;s way. Malin charged up a ball, which engulfed her body, and fired beams in many directions.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: (What? A <strong>multi-directional blast</strong>?)</p></p>

<p><p>The beams hit everything and anything. Margarita flew out of harm&rsquo;s way.</p></p>

<p><p>So stop wasting your energy and start saving it up.</p></p>

<p><p>When Malin was done with her rampage, she panted for breath. She figured at least one beam would hit her opponent, after all that.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Margarita appeared and fired an Energy Blast. Malin was hit, and sent pummeling through the ground. Kabam.</p></p>

<p><p>She recovered. &ldquo;Ugh&#8230;damn it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I know you can do better than that!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin flew up, and they went at it again. Pak, pok, pak.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Your technique is not good enough. You need to hit with full force.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;Stop lecturing me like you know me!&rdquo; Pow!</p></p>

<p><p>They landed on a branch, and continued hitting. Pak pok pak. Then jumped away. Malin charged up red energy on her arm, and it took the form of a sword. The energy concentrated into a sharp blade like form and extended from her fingers.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Is this the <strong>Hand Sword </strong>technique?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You know it.&rdquo; She slashed, Margrit jumped away.</p></p>

<p><p>They landed on the ground. Malin screamed and slashed, Margrit jumped away from the trajectory range. Slash! The ground was cut and burning.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Damn, that&rsquo;s more dangerous than I thought.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;And who was saying I had no technique?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You want some fancy moves? I&rsquo;ve got some of my own too.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So why don&rsquo;t ya show &lsquo;em?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit secretly gathered energy into her palm.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I will teach you another technique. This one is quite useful under many circumstances. It is called the <strong>Concentrated Orb</strong>.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin punched Margarita against a tree. Margarita threw the Concentrated Orb at her. It started to explode, and Malin ran away, but she was caught in the shockwave. Boom! A good piece of the forest blew up.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;C-Crap&#8230;&rdquo; Malin said, all battered up.</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita charged, and then Malin charged. Suddenly, both stopped, when they were inches away from hitting. Malin&rsquo;s Hand Sword was next to Margrit&rsquo;s neck, and Margrit&rsquo;s fist, full of energy, was inches from her stomach. They were in a deadlock.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Good match.&rdquo; Malin said, powering down, and fell. Margrit caught her.</p></p>

<p><p>The fight was over.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell finally finished up with level 18 of the Simulator. It was so tiring he fell right after the simulation ended. Moku went to his aid.</p></p>

<p><p>Thereafter, Malin continued to train under the Simulator. Later on that day, she went back to the training grounds and kept hitting the piece of wood. And finally, she kicked it so hard that it broke. The piece of wood flung in the air and landed. Thud. For the first time, Malin felt satisfied with herself.</p></p>

<p><p>And thus, both Margarita and Malin have learned the same lesson, without explicitly saying it. Both of them have made many mistakes in their fight. But that didn&rsquo;t matter. None of them meant a victory or a win. It&rsquo;s the consistency that matters. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you make mistakes, but if you do your best, then you will have no regrets. Margarita knew Malin learned it, and vice versa. These two seem to understand each other well.</p></p>

<p> <p>In the Great War, it&rsquo;s not just the military forces that are battling. The citizens have to fight as well. They do not have a choice, for they&rsquo;ll never know if they might be attacked next. It is a harsh reality of war, but innocents get killed all the time. But sometimes, innocents become guilty. They band together to form militia groups and terrorist groups. The <strong>Black Hand</strong> was one such terrorist group, well-known throughout <strong>Macedonion</strong>.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sir, we are surrounded!&rdquo; yelled the commander.</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not good. Not good at all.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Outside of the base was a hill. There were no trees or vegetation. Just dry land. Above the hills were trenches where Loyalist soldiers hid in. The trenches surrounded the base completely. The battle has started three hours ago. But how long will it last?</p></p>

<p><p>Behind the trenches was a red flag. Three people stood by it - General Jarus and his two commanders. They thought it was only a matter of time before victory came to their side.</p></p>

<p><p>Morning came. Margrit woke up with a yawn and sat up in her sleeping bag. She stretched her arms and stood up, facing the window. The morning breeze was cool and comfy. The sky was red and the sun was rising.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, a comet-like object appeared in the sky. It smashed into the ground with a bang. A sphere of fire was seen.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit was shocked. &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell and Lotus heard it too. &ldquo;What the heck? A bomb?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What could have caused it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The heroes ran outside to see the cause of the disturbance. They found a crater that&rsquo;s hot and burning. A space pod was in its center.</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;Strange. This was just like the day when you two came here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Yeah. Remember, Margrit?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Of course. How can I not remember it? Say, you think there&rsquo;s two kids inside?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The pod door opened and the heroes gasped.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;What if...it&rsquo;s an enemy?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a possibility.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>To their surprise, an injured man came out. He was in such bad condition he moaned and crawled out. His hand pressed against his bloody stomach.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a man and he&rsquo;s injured.&rdquo; Margrit helped him to his knees.</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;Who are you? What happened?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I...uhhhh....&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s bring him to the temple first.&rdquo; Jerrell said.</p></p>

<p><p>So the three carried the stranger into their home.</p></p>

<p><p>He was in a sleeping bag, unconscious. Margrit put an ice bag on his forehead to let his temperature cool down. He moaned and his eyelids moved.</p></p>

<p><p>The stranger was about six and a half feet tall, with gray hair, and a young, confident face. He was dressed like a special agent, but he didn&rsquo;t look threatening.</p></p>

<p><p>He moaned once again and finally woke up.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hey there. You finally woke up.&rdquo; She smiled.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Uhh...? Who are you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My name is Margarita. And you came to our planet just yesterday. You were injured so my brother and I treated your wounds.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He sat up, holding his stomach. &ldquo;Thank you. Tell me, where am I?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Planet T-5, a neutral zone. You&rsquo;re in my master&rsquo;s temple.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He sighed. &ldquo;I made it safely at last.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name? I told you mine. And where did you come from?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My name is <strong>Kerell</strong>, and I am from planet Macedonion.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oooh I heard about that place.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell and Lotus entered the room. &ldquo;Did you sleep well?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell: &ldquo;Ah, yes, thank you for your hospitality.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;Welcome to my temple, young one.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Everyone, he is Kerell from Macedonion.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;Macedonion? I see. When we found you, you were a mess. How did you get injured?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I will explain everything to you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>So he began. The heroes listened with all ears.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;As I&rsquo;ve said before, my name is Kerell. I am not a soldier, but a special secret agent. I work for the <strong>Black Hand</strong>, a terrorist organization.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Terrorist?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;The Black Hand? I have heard of them. They are terrorists, yes, but they are Rebels fighting for a good cause.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;To make a long story short, a few days ago I recieved an assignment to kill President Octell. He is the current present of planet Macedonia. He is a Loyalist. He obeys the wishes of the Dark Empire at the cost of our people. That is why I must kill him! But I failed my mission. I was so close. He injured me and I barely escaped with my life.&rdquo; As he said his last sentence, he clenched his hands together and bit his lip.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So, you came here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s the only safe place I could think of.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Did they follow you here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. I&rsquo;ve been drifting in space for days.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;You poor man! Luckily we treated those wounds in time.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I thank you again.&rdquo; He moaned from his injury.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo; Margrit said worriedly, helping him up.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. Really.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;So, tell us, Mr. Kerell, how is the war going in Macedonia?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;At first, the rebels were losing, just like in Arlia. But over time our forces became strong. And with the help of the Black Hand and other such organizations, our power became even greater. President Octavius could not handle so many attacks at once. We were winning, but then Octavius sent his troops to all cities in the planet and took over them, making sure no rebels were hiding there. Now the whole planet has become a military zone.&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s now a war zone.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Lotus said silently.</p></p>

<p><p>A long silence struck the room.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Margrit said loudly, purposely breaking the silence, &ldquo;all hope&rsquo;s not lost, right, master?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Of course. Hope is never lost.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I <strong>hope</strong>so.&rdquo; Kerell said.</p></p>

<p><p>Everybody laughed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Come out, come out. You can&rsquo;t stay there forever.&rdquo; the commander shouted to the bunkers.</p></p>

<p><p>Jarus: &ldquo;Has the cannon come yet?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Commander: &ldquo;It should be here in five minutes.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jarus: &ldquo;Good.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Meanwhile, inside the base...</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to attack some time today. Arrgh it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before we&rsquo;re goners.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sergeant: &ldquo;All troops are ready to go, sir.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Good. It&rsquo;s time to fight back. Hit &lsquo;em with everything we&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>And thus, Coitus sent the order throughout the camp.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell and Lotus went outside to buy some food. This time they brought money for four instead of three, since they have a guest.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit and Kerell sat next to each other on the roof of the temple, enjoying the nice weather.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve failed your missing, right? That must be a bummer, huh?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. I wanted Octavius dead so bad. He&rsquo;s a menace to the rebel cause.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I know. I&rsquo;m a rebel myself. I&rsquo;ve never heard of him, but I want him dead too.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So, ummm, Margarita, where are you from?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m from...Arlia.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Arlia? I heard its crazy over there.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It must be a bummer for you too, eh?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You could say that. My parents were killed in Arlia. I...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. It was a long time ago.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>As they continued chatting, they talked about other, not so personal things. Margrit had no idea why she mentioned her parents&rsquo; death to this guy. She hoped it didn&rsquo;t affect the way he thought about her.</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell: &ldquo;Oh I have to contact the Black Hand headquarters. I&rsquo;ll be with you in a minute.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell pushed a button on his watch and a hologram popped out.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit watched it with interest.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is agent Kerell calling to headquarters.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it is you, agent Kerell.&rdquo; the hologram said. It was an old man dressed in a uniform. &ldquo;What is your status?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell was seen on the large screen in headquarters. &ldquo;I regret to inform you that I have failed in the assassination of President Octavius. I&rsquo;ve failed. I was so close, but he was too powerful. I barely escaped with my life.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; What is your current location?&rdquo; inquired the hologram.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I am in planet T-5, also called Ruskus. A neutral zone.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ooh, who might this be?&rdquo; Margrit asked, peering at the hologram.</p></p>

<p><p>On the other side of communication, Margrit&rsquo;s face covered Kerell&rsquo;s as she got real close.</p></p>

<p><p>Commander: &ldquo;Young lady, who the heck are you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell pushed Margrit&rsquo;s head away. &ldquo;Oh, she is a resident of T-5. Her name is Margarita.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aaak, Kerell, our communications are supposed to be confidential.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry sir. I believe that she can be trusted. She&rsquo;s a rebel too, and she&rsquo;s the one who saved my life. I will assume all responsibility if anything happens.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Have it your way. Pleased to meet you, Margarita.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Say, can I become a member of the Black Hand just like you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Umm, I don&rsquo;t know. Well, sir, can she?&rdquo; Kerell asked nervously.</p></p>

<p><p>Commander: &ldquo;First of all, you don&rsquo;t just apply like that. Secondly, she needs to have a background of-&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;She does! She&rsquo;s a sayan warrior and she&rsquo;s very skilled in the art of combat.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;And second of all, we do not accept anyone under 18. I am sorry.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hey, that&rsquo;s not fair!&rdquo; she snapped. How the heck can he tell she&rsquo;s not 18?</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;End communication.&rdquo; The hologram was gone.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sorry. You heard my boss.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. I&rsquo;ll join when I&rsquo;m older.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You really want to join, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. It&rsquo;s gonna be cool.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But why? You&rsquo;re a sayan though.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do anything to get rid of those Loyalists. It doesn&rsquo;t matter to me. When I&rsquo;m through with Arlia, it&rsquo;s going to be Macedonion next. And then Masadonion. And finally, Murai itself.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell thought she was very ambitious, but unrealistic. But he didn&rsquo;t say it.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Master, can you tell me more about the Black Hand?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;Me? Why not find out form Kerell himself?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well, he didn&rsquo;t tell us everything. He <strong>is </strong>a secret agent, so he is hiding certain information from us. I don&rsquo;t really trust him.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;True. We cannot trust a stranger at first. But he <strong>is</strong> one of us. The Black Hand is a terrorist organization formed out from need. In times of war, innocent civilians are slaughtered everyday. But in Macedonion, a group of civilians decided that they&rsquo;ve had enough. They were sick and tired of seeing loved ones die and they have run away and be powerless to stop them. At first, they had just civilians, inexperienced in combat. But they did what they could to survive.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Images of people banding together and holding guns.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;When the Loyalists attacked a city, the Black Hand fought back valiantly. Eventually, they became an officially organization, and started recruiting more experienced people. Although they tried to keep themselves a secret, their popularity is widespread with the Faction, and they are one of the most wanted on the Loyalist&rsquo;s list. You&rsquo;re probably wondering how did a group that civilians formed became a terrorist organization? That&rsquo;s simple. Because they were once victims of being terrorized. And they got tired of it. Their methods of doing things are still controversial.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But then again, so is war.&rdquo; Jerrell added.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes&#8230;in war&#8230;anything goes. There are no rules.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>On the battlefield, the two army of soldiers charged into the enemy. When they met they fought violently and mercilessly. On the back line were the snipers and shooters. They shot lasers at carefully aimed targets.</p></p>

<p><p>Thousands of screaming voices were heard. Coitus flew above, observing everything. Jarus ascended to join his foe.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Coitus, I presume?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes. That&rsquo;s me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My name is Jarus. I&rsquo;m here to kill you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How nice.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You know your army can&rsquo;t win. They&rsquo;re surrounded.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about that.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They started fighting. Pak, pok, pak. They fought as they&rsquo;ve known each other and have been archenemies for years.</p></p>

<p><p>Jarus punched Coitus in the stomach, then in the chin. Thud. He proceeded to fire a blast. &ldquo;Take this, Rebel scum!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Boom. Coitus blocked the beam unharmed.</p></p>

<p><p>Jarus: &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus: &ldquo;This is for Jeremiah!!&rdquo; He charged and punched. Kapow! Jarus fell down.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Why you. I&rsquo;m going to get you!&rdquo; Jarus said angrily.</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus landed. &ldquo;Make your move.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jarus charged and fired an energy beam, Coitus blurred. &ldquo;What?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus appeared on in front of him and blasted him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aaaaaah!&rdquo; Jarus was smashed against the pavement. &ldquo;Grrr&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>His commander quickly went to help him get up.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Our forces are being pushed back, sir. We are losing troops like crazy.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jarus: &ldquo;Grrr. It seems that we have lost this battle. We will retreat.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What about the men?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let them die.&rdquo; Jarus said, walking away.</p></p>

<p><p>The commander was shocked at his words. Such cruelty and disregard for his men. But an order is an order. No one dared to disobey a general.</p></p>

<p><p>As the Loyalists troops retreated, the Rebels cheered and raised their arms in the air.</p></p>

<p><p>Coitus and Kemia looked at each other, and laughed happily. This was not just a victory, but a breakthrough in belief. Somehow, other camps heard about this victory. News spread like wildfire. The Faction now had a new hope and new passion for winning.</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="11">11: Intrusion Into Neutral Territory. </span></p></center>

<p> <p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo; cried the helpless victim.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Nimbus does not show mercy. You die!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The shadow being shot a beam at its victim from close range. The victim&rsquo;s body disintegrated, but not before letting out a scream of his life.</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus stepped out of the shadows. &ldquo;What a piece of trash. He was worthless.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p><strong>Destructo</strong>: &ldquo;Look&rsquo;s like our job&rsquo;s done here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p><strong>Goldark</strong>: &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s our next destination?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus: &ldquo;We must make a report back at base.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The three figures got into space pods and they lifted off.</p></p>

<p><p>Several mornings later, the heroes woke up at dawn and began their usual training. They&rsquo;d each take turns in the Simulator.</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita fought off the flying mines in level 15. She blew them up as they came. Occasionally, cyborgs showed up.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wow, this is a snap!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And here I was thinking that level 15 would be harder.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: (She doesn&rsquo;t know she passed level 20 on that day. When the cup of coffee spilled on the machine. She doesn&rsquo;t know her own potential. Will she believe me if I told her the truth about that day?)</p></p>

<p><p>When they were done with the Simulator, Master Lotus would comment them on their techniques, and teach them some philosophical stuff. That was usually boring stuff but today Master Lotus had a lesson to teach that interested Margrit.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;To become a true warrior - when you fall down, you must get back up.&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Remember that.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Margrit said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not whether you will be defeated. You will. But it is how you deal with it that matters.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>That phrase became the cornerstone of their existence as warriors. Margarita and Jerrell followed that belief to the fullest. The dedicated sayans did their very best to become true warriors.</p></p>

<p><p>Two years passed by quickly and peacefully. Malin and Kerell continued training on their own, while the Florencia children continued their tutelage under Master Lotus.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Scan this area. Make sure nobody spots us.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes sir.&rdquo; The soldier left.</p></p>

<p><p><strong>Speirs</strong>: &ldquo;Hmmm. Listen up men, work hard and we can go home faster.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;<strong>Yes sir!</strong>&rdquo; they all said at once.</p></p>

<p><p>Speirs went into the space craft, walking on the diagonal platform that was the door. He entered the pilot room and started communications with an important person.</p></p>

<p><p>Beep beep beep. &ldquo;Greetings, General Vegeta.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Vegeta: &ldquo;What is your status?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Speirs: &ldquo;Blue. Nobody has discovered us yet. You were right, there are a plentiful amount of resources here we can use for the war.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Good. Get as much as you can. If anyone knows that you are here, kill him immediately.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>In the bushes, some one or something was watching them. The unknown being observed the ship, covered with grass and vines.</p></p>

<p><p>S-soldier A: &ldquo;Did you hear that?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>S-soldier B: &ldquo;Hear what?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>S-soldier A: &ldquo;Never mind. I must be hearing things.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The three heroes planned to go on a shopping spree. Lotus had entered a lotto contest and won 4000 <strong>UU</strong>&rsquo;s. Lucky them. They had never seen so much money together before. So they were gonna use it to the fullest.</p></p>

<p><p>As they walked down the street, they saw a crowd of people together, talking some gossip. This was a usual scene, except that there usually wasn&rsquo;t so many people. It didn&rsquo;t look like they were gossiping.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;I wonder what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s find out.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The three went towards the crowd, but could not get through. &ldquo;Excuse me.&rdquo; Margrit said, tapping on a male adult&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Stranger: &ldquo;This guy is saying that soldiers are here in the Memphis forest.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;Soldiers? What soldiers?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Moku heard this question and answered him: &ldquo;Arlian soldiers.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Arlian soldiers?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Moku: &ldquo;I was walking along the woods until I heard some voices. I hid behind a bush and luckily no one found me. I saw a space ship of some sort and several men guarding it. I could recognize the symbol on their suits. They are definitely sayans.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;But T-5 is a neutral zone! What are soldiers doing here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;This is very bad.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Moku: &ldquo;Surely the king is not going to violate the <strong>Neutral Zone Rights Act</strong>.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Neutral Rights Act?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Moku: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised you haven&rsquo;t heard of it. It&rsquo;s a universal law that was created a long, long time ago. It was formed by a committee consisting of representatives from many different planets. It&rsquo;s kinda like United Nations on earth. Although this law is not explicitly enforced, every planet has a right to remain neutral, and stay out of war, should it arise. And those planets involved in war cannot force others to get involved in the war. We have a right to neutrality.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;But the only way to enforce the law is if-&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Moku: &ldquo;If the army of T-5 drives out the Loyalists. But then again, we don&rsquo;t know what they are doing here. If we should attack them&#8230;they will think certain things. But then again, they&rsquo;ve already broken this law.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh man,&rdquo; said a stranger in the crowd, &ldquo;Who knows what they could be up to? I&rsquo;m not going outside anymore. It&rsquo;s not safe.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Chatter amongst the crowd.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I think we should check it out.&rdquo; Margrit said, addressing her master and brother.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;Moku, where is the ship you speak of?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Moku: &ldquo;Why do you want to know?&rdquo; He gasped. &ldquo;Lotus, Surely you&rsquo;re not foolish enough to go there. I barely escaped with my life.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well, if you will not tell me then I will find it myself. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit and Jerrell followed him.</p></p>

<p><p>They went through the woods, figuring that the ship should be around here somewhere. They walked according to the directions in Margrit&rsquo;s scouter.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell stopped.</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;What is wrong?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;I thought I heard something.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;It could be anything. Maybe an animal.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You could be right. But I&rsquo;ve got a bad hunch.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hey you!&rdquo; shouted an unfamiliar voice.</p></p>

<p><p>All three directed attention to the soldier. He was covered by a helmet and marine suit, armed and extremely dangerous. &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;The question is, what are <strong>you</strong>doing here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>S-soldier C: &ldquo;How much do you know?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Know about what?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>S-soldier C: &ldquo;Enough! Don&rsquo;t move.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus had a rock hidden in his hand all this time. He suddenly threw it at the soldier and knocked the gun off his hand. &ldquo;Now!&rdquo; he shouted.</p></p>

<p><p>Instantly, Jerrell punched his stomach and kicked his chin, he screamed and fell unconscious.</p></p>

<p><p>Speirs heard the faint scream and reacted with alert. &ldquo;What was that?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>S-soldier D: &ldquo;Officer down! Officer down!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Speirs: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been discovered! Go find out who did it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A group of soldiers went into the woods.</p></p>

<p><p>The heroes kept searching. Bingo. They found an opening. They saw four guys on each corner of the ship, on full guard. The ship itself was covered in green stuff and vines. Margrit thought they were doing a bad job of hiding it.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Here it is.&rdquo; Jerrell said.</p></p>

<p><p>The heroes heard shouting behind them.</p></p>

<p><p>D: &ldquo;Did you find them?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>E: &ldquo;Negative.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>D: &ldquo;Keep searching. I&rsquo;ll go this way.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;They&rsquo;re looking for us.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;What do we do now, master?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The soldiers came to the spot the heroes were at, but found nobody. &ldquo;I thought I heard something from here.&rdquo; one said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;They must be around here somewhere. You go that way. And you go that way.&rdquo; the lieutenant said, pointing.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly Master Lotus jumped from a tree branch and whacked the lieutenant with his wooden stick. He was out cold. The other two soldiers quickly turned around and opened fire. Lotus ran to the side, avoiding the stream of bullets.</p></p>

<p><p>Whack! Margrit whacked the soldier from behind. Wham! Jerrell punched the other soldier&rsquo;s face.</p></p>

<p><p>Speirs: &ldquo;What the heck is going on over there?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The heroes revealed themselves.</p></p>

<p><p>Speirs&rsquo;s soldiers pointed their guns at them. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me you took care of my men?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we did.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Speirs: &ldquo;What a joke! Four of my men, defeated by an old man and two children.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Who you calling children?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;What are you doing here? Don&rsquo;t you know this planet is a neutral zone?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Speirs: &ldquo;So? Who cares? I have specific orders to come here and take this planet&rsquo;s resources. I will accomplish my mission whether you like it or not.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;Your mission? You Loyalists have gone too far. These resources belong to <strong>our </strong>planet. It does not belong to you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Have it your way. I will show no mercy. Get &lsquo;em, men!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Soldier F and soldier G aimed their guns. Margrit dodged a laser and jumped at super speed, then kicked F in face. Jerrell did a flying kick and knocked down G.</p></p>

<p><p>Speirs couldn&rsquo;t believe his eyes. &ldquo;Drats! These kids are trained well. Even better than my men. Who are they?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;Just leave this planet and nobody gets hurt.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;In your dreams.&rdquo; he said, pointing his gun.</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus threw his stick and it flew like a frisbee. Whack! It hit Speirs&rsquo;s hand and he dropped the gun. Lotus ran forward and Speirs shot an orange energy ball at him. Bam!</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus completely did not expect that. &ldquo;Oof!&rdquo; he yelled, falling.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Master!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Speirs jumped on top of the ship. &ldquo;Ahahahahaha! Come and get me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell went to Lotus. &ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit jumped on the ship and attacked Speirs. He blocked her attacks and kicked her, she fell on the dirt.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell fired a beam and Speirs fired an energy ball. The beam wiped out his attack and hit Speirs, pushing him off the ship. He recovered, then got inside the space craft.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell gathered energy and fired a beam at the ship&rsquo;s front. Boom! It exploded. Soldiers ran out.</p></p>

<p><p>Speirs fell on the grass. &ldquo;Why you lousy little...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pulverizing time.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;You should have taken my warning seriously. You should&rsquo;ve left this planet alone.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Speirs: &ldquo;Die!&rdquo; He ran.</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus ran through him, and in a nano-second, hit him with his stick. Speirs didn&rsquo;t know what hit him.</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita grabbed him by the collar. &ldquo;Now, start talking.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Uhhh&#8230;uhhh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, a gun fired. Speirs coughed blood, then died.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Huh? What?&rdquo; She looked at the woods.</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell was holding a gun, and the barrel was smoking. Apparently he fired the shot.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Kerell? Why? I was just about to make him talk.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&#8230;but you were too close to him. He might&rsquo;ve been hiding a weapon.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;I see&#8230;thanks for your concern.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Master, why? Why of all planets, did they have to come here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It seems that sayans are more daring than I thought. Planet Arlia has little resources left so they have to get it from other planets. They are willing to do whatever it takes to win, even intrusion into neutral territory.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell: &ldquo;But you two are sayans too, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t confuse us with the Loyalists. We&rsquo;re different.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell looked at the small red dot in the sky. At certain times of the day, planet Arlia can be seen from here. &ldquo;Damn it&#8230;what are they thinking?&rdquo;</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="12">12: River Of Tears And Blood. </span></p></center>


<p> <p>&ldquo;To become a true warrior - when you fall, you must get back up.&rdquo; That is Master Lotus&rsquo;s most important lesson he can give to his students. And it is very true, no matter who you are.</p></p>

<p><p>Bored, Margarita joined Kerell, who was sitting on the roof of the temple.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So, like, are you going to go back to headquarters soon?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet. I&rsquo;m kinda wanted by the Macedonion government. Going back will be very dangerous. I need to rest first. But soon, I&rsquo;ll go back and kill Octavius, that bastard.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit laughed and covered her mouth.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But for the meantime, I will be staying here and living with you three.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great. I can show you around.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Around where?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Around Memphis. It&rsquo;s a village close by.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That sounds great.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sure. Wait. Take this.&rdquo; She gave him a green stone, the one she bought some time ago from that strange old lady. Yep, that strange old lady gave her the creeps, alright.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ummm, gee, thanks.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good luck charm. This might help you on your mission.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell took it and wore it.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;It looks good on you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Really.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; shouted Vegeta, &ldquo;Speirs has failed me?&rdquo;<br>  S-Soldier: &ldquo;Apparently so. His ship was destroyed.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is very bad. If the military of T-5 knows about the operation, then they&rsquo;ll surely start a war with Arlia. But they&rsquo;re not doing that. So it must be someone else who killed him.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Should I go to find out who?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No. I will send Nimbus. You will go and observe, then come back and make a report. Understood?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes sir.&rdquo; He saluted and disappeared.</p></p>

<p><p>(Who could have killed Speirs?) Vegeta thought to himself.</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita yawned as she leaned against the window in a lazy manner. Jerrell was looking at maps of the Arlian continents.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo; *Yawn* It&rsquo;s so boring here, don&rsquo;t ya think, brother? There&rsquo;s nothing to do around here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, sure, it&rsquo;s boring. But at least we&rsquo;re safe.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Safe and boring don&rsquo;t have to go together.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But apparently it does.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit stepped down from the window. &ldquo;Say, whatcha looking at?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s maps of the continents. This is what the Faction has so far, and this is what the Loyalists have so far.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh geez. A battle plan? How boring.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Everything is boring to you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Three space pods entered T-5&rsquo;s atmosphere and crashed to the ground. A fiery sphere appeared, then died out. The pod doors opened and three figures stepped out.</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus: &ldquo;Ahh, good old planet T-5. Nothing has changed.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Destructo: &ldquo;This was where Speirs failed. This is hard to believe.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Goldark: &ldquo;Speirs was a failure from the start. I saw it coming.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus: &ldquo;But for sure, we will <strong>not</strong>make the same mistake. Now, if I still remember correctly, there is a village called Memphis around here&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>By evening, the three found the village of Memphis and entered curiously. They looked around as the people were frozen with fear.</p></p>

<p><p>Villagers stared at him like the devil. Mothers told their children to go home and others ran away. Some were too scared to move and stood there, wondering what the stranger will do next.</p></p>

<p><p>Moku confronted them. &ldquo;We do not have outsiders here often. What do you want?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A few of the men couldn&rsquo;t believe how brave he was.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;One month ago, a group of soldiers came here. Am I right? It was Speirs and his squadron. Tell me, what happened to them?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I have no idea what you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo; Moku answered.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t play dumb.&rdquo; Goldark snickered. &ldquo;I know your village had something to do with his death.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Listen stranger, our village is a peaceful village, and we do not engage in any sort of action you are hinting at. I swear I do not know who this Speirs is.&rdquo; Moku hoped his lie was convincing, but the &lsquo;outsider&rsquo; was not convinced.</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus: &ldquo;So, you still won&rsquo;t answer, eh? Maybe somebody here knows.&rdquo; he said, looking at a mother and her child. They shrieked and hugged.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Leave the villagers alone!&rdquo; Moku suddenly shouted.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Why do you care about them?&rdquo; Nimbus asked.</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus came by and saw the men arguing. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; he asked himself.</p></p>

<p><p>Moku: &ldquo;Please, leave our village in peace.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I will do as I wish. How about if I kill every single villager here? Starting with you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Moku sweated and stepped back. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t dare.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He was about to attack, just then Lotus intervened.</p></p>

<p><p>[Split screen - 3] - [Nimbus, Goldark, Destructo].</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who are you, old man?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Old man? Now that is an insult.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Moku: (This looks bad.)</p></p>

<p><p>Goldark: &ldquo;How dare you get in my way?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Goldark charged, Lotus kicked, knocking him down. Goldark got up and grunted.</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus stopped him. &ldquo;Hold it, Goldark. Let me handle this one.&rdquo; He smiled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re no ordinary old man, are you? Who are you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My name is Lotus.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Lotus?&rdquo; Nimbus repeated to himself. It sounded hauntingly familiar. &ldquo;Lotus? Lotus of the Elite Four?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Destructo: &ldquo;This man is a sayan? A member of the Elite Four?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;That was a long time ago. I&rsquo;m retired now. But you bastards just can&rsquo;t leave our village alone. I do not tolerate rudeness.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus laughed. &ldquo;Aha ha ha ha ha! So you&rsquo;re the last member of the Elite Four, the one who was rumored to have run away because he&rsquo;s scared of a little war. Ah ha ha ha. I never expected to find you in this pathetic state&#8230;in this pathetic planet.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;I came here to avoid war. And I still intend to do so.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh really?&rdquo; Nimbus said, and he fired a fire beam. Froom.</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus blocked it, but it burned his hand. &ldquo;Aaaaagh!&rdquo; Suddenly, he blurred, and appeared from above, and kicked. Wham!</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus was hit, and flipped and landed. &ldquo;Not bad. You still have some moves.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>While Margarita and Jerrell were still inside the temple, <strong>Lance </strong>and <strong>Aria</strong>, two other sayans who were Nimbus&rsquo;s henchmen, flew up.</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita sensed them, then Jerrell. By the time they turned around, it was too late. Lance and Aria fired a beam into the building, and it went kaboom! A piece of the temple blew up.</p></p>

<p><p>Malin, training alone in the woods: &ldquo;What the hell was that?&rdquo; From where she was, she could see the temple exploding.</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell: &ldquo;Can this be&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They hurried over to the temple. Lance and Aria laughed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hey you!! Are you responsible for this?&rdquo; Malin shouted from the ground.</p></p>

<p><p>Lance: &ldquo;Another little pest. What should we do?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Aria: &ldquo;Get rid of her!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They fired beams at her, and she ran for it. <strong>Kaboom! Boom. Boom.</strong> She was covered up by explosions, and coughed from the smoke and fire.</p></p>

<p><p>The sayans laughed, but Aria was knocked away by another beam. Boom.</p></p>

<p><p>Lance: &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell: &ldquo;Never let your guard down.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lance: &ldquo;Insolent little bug!&rdquo; He flew at Kerell and threw energy balls. They kept on shooting things at each other in the air.</p></p>

<p><p>When Aria got up, he was confused. &ldquo;Oww&#8230;what happened?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;Let me refresh your memory!&rdquo; Pow!</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Aria and Lance stood side by side. &ldquo;Damn, these bugs are tougher than we thought.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell and Malin stood side by side, and they kept on fighting, and they ended up in the woods.</p></p>

<p><p>Boom. Boom.</p></p>

<p><p>Both sides took a rest, staring at each other.</p></p>

<p><p>Lance noticed Kerell&rsquo;s badge. &ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re from the Black Hand, eh? I heard about your latest failure.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell: &ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re sayans, eh? I heard about your latest defeat by the Rebels. General Jarus must be really pissed off.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lance got upset. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s only a minor setback, you insolent runt!&rdquo; He charged, Kerell punched him away.</p></p>

<p><p>Aria charged. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be a match for a sayan!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin ducked his punch. &ldquo;Well, guess what? I <strong>am</strong> a sayan!&rdquo; She punched him in the chin, knocking him into the same spot at Lance.</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell: &ldquo;Will you do the honors?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;With pleasure.&rdquo; She fired the Energy Blast, and blew up a piece of the forest. The attackers&rsquo; signals were gone.</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell: &ldquo;Oh no! Margarita and Jerrell! Let&rsquo;s check on them!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Amongst the rubble&#8230;</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita was under a piece of what used to be the roof. &ldquo;Ouch&#8230;&rdquo; She got up and pushed the trash off her. She helped her brother get up.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Damn those Loyalists. Where are they?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell and Malin flew up to their altitude. &ldquo;We took care of them. They won&rsquo;t be bothering us anymore.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Well, you saved our butts. Thanks.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell: &ldquo;Got any idea who our attackers were?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;No doubt they&rsquo;re Loyalists. But I doubt they will send just two guys to attack us.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita just sensed something. &ldquo;Oh no! Master Lotus.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>After one second of silence, everyone flew towards Memphis.</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus ran and punched, Lotus fought back. Lotus&rsquo;s martial arts moves were better than his opponent expected, but he could handle it. Krack! Pow! Thud!</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus kicked, Nimbus ducked. He punched Lotus in the chin, knocking him backwards. The old man got up.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not on the Elite Four for nothing...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He moved his hands so that one was on top of another, leaving empty space in between for the energy. Electric sparks appeared between his palms. His enemy awaited his move. Energy flashed and vanished, then an energy ball formed, gold, bright, powerful. Lotus grunted from the weight. He carried the ball to his side, then threw it forward.</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus ran and did a super charge. The energy ball hit him and slammed him into a straw house.</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus breathed hard. &ldquo;That should keep him down for a while.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>All the remains of the house were blown away when Nimbus powered up. He was angry. &ldquo;Blast you old man!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus was shocked. Nimbus jumped and Lotus jumped away. Nimbus fired and hit the ground, and the explosion made Lotus fall.</p></p>

<p><p>Moku: &ldquo;Lotus!!&rdquo; He charged.</p></p>

<p><p>Goldark knocked him away. Wham.</p></p>

<p><p>While the group of four was flying, Margarita said: &ldquo;Oh man, we better hurry. I don&rsquo;t want master to get hurt.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;Hey don&rsquo;t worry, he&rsquo;ll be fine. He <strong>is</strong> one of the Elite Four, after all.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Magrit and Jerrell suddenly stopped flying. &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; Jerrell asked.</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;What? Don&rsquo;t tell me you didn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;He never told us&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Master Lotus&#8230;has been a member of the Elite Four&#8230;this whole time? He was our father&rsquo;s friend?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Then they continued flying. A lot went on their minds.</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus panted for breath, and charged recklessly.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Say your prayers, Lotus!!&rdquo; Nimbus fired the Wrath Beam and Lotus tried to block it, and he screamed as the beam went through him. His clothes were smoking. Then he fell on his knees. Then splat.</p></p>

<p><p>It was evening already. The four heroes got to the village, and they were completely dumbfounded by what they saw. No words could describe their anguish and disgust at the destruction of Memphis. Dead bodies lay all over. Buildings were burned. Nothing was left untouched.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;What in the hell?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell: &ldquo;No way&#8230;they killed everybody. Those cold blooded murderers.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit almost threw up just at the sight of the burnt bodies. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s disgusting.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;Believe it or not, I&rsquo;ve seen plenty of scenes like this in Arlia.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell: &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re used to it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;How can anyone get used to this? Every time I see something like this, I get a queasy feeling in my stomach.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>While they continued walking, they saw a familiar figure lying on the ground and quickly went to his rescue. They were shocked once they realized who he was.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Master Lotus!!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Master!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Are you alright? Speak to me!&rdquo; Margrit said, turning him over.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My children...I am afraid I cannot accompany you any further...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit&rsquo;s eyes were filled with tears. &ldquo;No, Master! You have to make it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Who did this? Who!?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&#8230;you must be careful...my children.&rdquo; He touched Magarita&rsquo;s face, and left this world forever. His hand fell on the ground.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;<strong>Master! Master!!! Noooo!</strong>&rdquo; Margrit shouted with tears. &ldquo;<strong>No...no...</strong>&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Master...&rdquo; Jerrell muttered silently. &ldquo;Why did you have to go so soon&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin was almost crying. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t deserve this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell grieved silently.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit continued screaming. Kerell walked over to her and touched her shoulder. &ldquo;The best we can do now is let him rest in peace.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo; *Sob* I swear...I will avenge you master! *Sob* &rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Jerrell sensed someone. Three of them. &ldquo;Those energy signals&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Apparently, Malin and Kerell felt it too. Margrit was still grieving.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;These energy signals&#8230;they are very strong. They must be the ones who killed Master Lotus.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin was pissed. It showed in her eyes. &ldquo;Those are the same group of people who attacked the temple. Let&rsquo;s not waste anytime.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell looked at Margrit, who was silent. She was kneeling in front of her dead master. &ldquo;Margarita, we&rsquo;ll be going ahead. You coming?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. We&rsquo;ll take care of them.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll join you guys soon.&rdquo; Margrit said, without turning around. &ldquo;The least I can do is give him a proper burial.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>With that said, Jerrell, Malin and Kerell flew off.</p></p>

<p><p>While waiting by the barren land, Destructo&rsquo;s scouter beeped. &ldquo;Hmmm, something&rsquo;s happening.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Nimbus asked, not having a scouter.</p></p>

<p><p>Destructo: &ldquo;Three people are coming toward us. Let&rsquo;s see...&rdquo; He pushed a button. &ldquo;Their power levels are extremely low.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus: &ldquo;Well, it looks like Aria and Lance failed. They were supposed to take care of the remaining people of Memphis. When they come back, we will have to decide on a punishment.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Goldak: &ldquo;But meanwhile, we can still have some fun.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A being watched them from above, unknown to them.</p></p>

<p><p>The heroes just showed up. Now the two groups stared at each other with much spite and hate.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Who did it? Who destroyed the peaceful village of Memphis? Who killed Master Lotus? Speak up.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus: &ldquo;My, how rude. Do you know who you&rsquo;re talking to?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;A dead man, if you don&rsquo;t answer me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus crossed his arms and smirked. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so daring, aren&rsquo;t you? Could you possibly be the runaway sayans from Arlia?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;Shut up and answer the question!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Goldark took at step forward. &ldquo;How rude, you punks! You should bow down before Lord Nimbus, the third strongest sayan in Arlia.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>All the heroes were shocked.</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell: &ldquo;Nimbus? I&rsquo;ve heard of that name before&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re the rumored expert assassin?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;In the flesh. &ldquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So you killed Master Lotus?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That old geezer? He was completely worthless.&rdquo; Nimbus said, smiling.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell can&rsquo;t hold his anger anymore, and charged.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My my, kids today are so hasty.&rdquo; Nimbus said, and blurred. Goldark and Destructo blurred. Then Malin and Kerell.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell went for Nimbus, hitting him constantly. Nimbus kicked him and flew away. Jerrell flew after him, but Destructo got in his way.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Move it or lose it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Destructo shot a beam, pushing Jerrell down to the ground.</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell chased Nimbus in high pursuit. Malin squared off with Goldark.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell and Destructo landed. &ldquo;Listen, chrome-dome, I want to fight Nimbus, not you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Destructo&rsquo;s reply: &ldquo;If you cannot defeat me, you have no right to fight Nimbus.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So be it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Both warriors powered up.</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell leaped at Nimbus and kicked. Doosh. Nimbus blocked and pushed him away. Kerell landed in a crouch, and he looked up, and gasped as a fiery beam hurled towards him. He quickly rolled out of its way. The beam went past him and blew up a rock. The explosion was huge.</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell was now worried that the rumors might be true. (This guy is not easy at all!)</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus was confident about his victory. After all, he never lost a match. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re from the Black Hand, are you not?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, what&rsquo;s it to you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Whether it&rsquo;s Arlia or Macedonion, it is still the same. We Loyalists will win. The Black Hand is obsolete!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Idiot. The Black Hand was formed to counter unwarranted attacks on innocent civilians, and to counter groups like the <strong>Magnificent Seven</strong>.&rdquo; Kerell fired a beam.</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus jumped away. Boom. &ldquo;Is that all your training amounts up to?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; Kerell flew to the air and punched crazily. Nimbus dodged fast. Doosh doosh doosh.</p></p>

<p><p>Malin and Goldark did the stare, then started. Malin let out a combo of punches and Goldark blocked. When she found an opening, she punched his chest, but he didn&rsquo;t show pain. He punched her in the chest, pushing her away.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh. Normal attacks won&rsquo;t work on me, little missy.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You think you&rsquo;re so tough, eh?&rdquo; Malin said. &ldquo;Take this!&rdquo; She formed the Hand Sword and slashed. Goldark jumped away, and turned himself into a rotating fireball. Froom! Malin jumped away from his path of destruction.</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell: (Damn it, this guy is tough. So he&rsquo;s one of the best sayans around, eh?)</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus: &ldquo;This little game is coming to an end.&rdquo; He charged up a big energy ball.</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita dropped the shovel. She just finished digging Lotus&rsquo;s grave. A wooden cross was put into the ground.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Master&#8230;rest in peace.&rdquo; Margarita said. Then she put on a scouter and flew off.</p></p>

<p><p>The fight has just started, and the heroes already have trouble with their adversaries.</p></p>

<p><p>Rumor has it that Nimbus is one of Vegeta&rsquo;s main assassins. He receives orders from his boss and goes from place to place, killing his targets, then goes back to his boss for a reward. His henchmen, Destructo and Goldark, go along with the ride. They help him gather information and of course, they share the prize. Nimbus is feared amongst Arlia, as much as Vegeta is. He claims to be the third strongest sayan in the universe. If these rumors hold true, do the heroes stand a chance?</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="13">13: Their First Real Fight. Nimbus's Power.</span></p></center>

<p> <p>In war people die all the time. Civilians get killed whether or not they are involved in the war. This is a harsh reality of war. But what about those who kill the innocents? Can they truly kill in cold blood without any mental consequences?</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus just finished charging energy, and fired the Wrath Beam. Kerell blocked it head on, and his hands were burning from the energy as the beam pushed him back. His feet scraped the ground. Scrrrrr. He was knocked into a boulder, and went through it. Kaboom.</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus laughed. &ldquo;Just like a weakling. Is there no one who can challenge me?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell, injured, was hiding behind a rock. &ldquo;So no one has ever lasted six minutes in a fight with Nimbus, huh? So if I survive for six minutes, then I&rsquo;ll be better than average, right?&rdquo; he said to himself.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Come out wherever you are.&rdquo; Nimbus flew around, trying to find his prey.</p></p>

<p><p>Goldark was in the air, shooting a bunch of energy balls randomly in all directions. He was spinning in circles and shooting. Malin dodged for her life. It became an obstacle course of her.</p></p>

<p><p>Goldark was sure he was going to get her. Malin kept on jumping away from the bombs. Boom. Boom.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I got you now!!&rdquo; Goldark fired a ball.</p></p>

<p><p>Malin: &ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; Boom!</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell powered up, and electric sparks surrounded him. Desrtructo formed an energy shield which expanded to Jerrell&rsquo;s field.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Electric Storm!!&rdquo; the sayan screamed.</p></p>

<p><p>The electricity overpowered the field and some of it hit Destructo. Thud. Destructo fell on his knees. It was bad for him, since he was partially a machine. A part on his stomach was damaged. &ldquo;Ugh! I didn&rsquo;t expect him to attack me with electricity.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell panted for breath. That move took up a lot of energy.</p></p>

<p><p>Destructo continued groaning. &ldquo;Ugh&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t let your guard down.&rdquo; Frooom. Kapow!</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aaaaagh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell thought he had him, but Destructo hit him in the middle of the charge, and he was thrown into a boulder.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha!&rdquo; Destructo laughed. &ldquo;Weakling.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus continued his little hunt. He kept blowing things up, and Kerell kept on running and hiding behind things in the terrain.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How long do you plan on running away? You blasted little rat.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell breathed hard. &ldquo;What am I going to do now? I can&rsquo;t take him head on now&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus sensed him. &ldquo;There you are.&rdquo; He fired.</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell ran away from the boulder and it blew up. Bam. He quickly ran behind another boulder.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How long do you plan on hiding?&rdquo; Nimbus shouted, firing at the boulder. Kaboom. He fired another one. Boom. Suddenly, Nimbus sensed another signal coming. &ldquo;Hmmm? What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita landed. She was wearing her life suit, boots, and equipped with a scouter.</p></p>

<p><p>Kerell sensed her presence too. &ldquo;Margarita&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus: &ldquo;Another one, eh? I heard that Speirs was killed by four people. Are you the last one?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita pointed at him. &ldquo;You&#8230;tell me, are you the one who killed my master?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Master? You mean Master Lotus? That old fool died a disgraceful death. In the end he was barely able to hurt me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita was already pissed off, and his words made her beyond pissed off. She was determined to beat this guy. &ldquo;So you did it&#8230;&rdquo; She powered up to the extreme. A big stream of white energy surrounded her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;If I were you, I wouldn&rsquo;t challenge me. I am Nimbus, the third strongest sayan in the universe! Every sayan cowards at the sound of my name! Ha ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give a shit who you are. You&rsquo;re going to pay.&rdquo; She was still full of white energy.</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus made a grimace. She didn&rsquo;t react how he expected her to. &ldquo;A brainless one, eh? Master Lotus is still training worthless garbage?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Quiet you!!&rdquo; Margarita charged and let out a fast combo. Doosh-doosh-doosh.</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus blocked while moving back. Margrit drew back her fist and punched. Nimbus was pushed back. Froom.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit charged, Nimbus jumped up. Margrit kept on attacking, while Nimbus went defensive. Whoosh! Whoosh! They went to the air.</p></p>

<p><p>(So&#8230;this is going to be my first real with. A fight where my life is on the line.) Margarita charged and punched, Nimbus evaded. Whoosh.</p></p>

<p><p>Bam. Kapow. Jerrell was thrown against the wall. &ldquo;Ugh&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Destructo laughed, but his stomach&rsquo;s pain got to him again. &ldquo;Ugh&#8230;damn it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell ran forward and punched his face. Wham. It was a good one. Destructo fell, and got up. He panted for breath.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect this&#8230;from a weakling.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Who you callin&rsquo; a weaking?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Warrior, who are you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My name is Jerrell. Jerrell Florencia.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Florencia? As in Jeremiah Florencia?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He was my father.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Your father&rsquo;s dead. Ha ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; Jerrell charged and hit him in the chest. Thud. Then his fist electrified, and blew Destructo away. Kabam. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you make fun of my father&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, the rocks floated up. They floated around Destructo. &ldquo;Jeremiah did not deserve to be one of the Elite Four. He was a disgrace!&rdquo; He fired a beam.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell jumped away, but the explosion knocked him down.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh, as expected. Like father, like son.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell got up and coughed. &ldquo;B-Bastard.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Destructo checked his scouter, and he was pleased with the result. &ldquo;Accept your fate, sayan. Those who are weak are destined to lose. The strong live, the weak perish. This is the way the world works.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;I am&#8230;not weak!!&rdquo; He charged, and they continued hitting.</p></p>

<p><p>Malin was having trouble as well. Goldark was giving her a hard time.</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita continued her relentless assault. Nimbus kept on dodging.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Margarita&#8230;you should escape while you can. There&rsquo;s no way you can beat Nimbus. He&rsquo;s known has six minute Nimbus&#8230;&rdquo; Kerell said to himself.</p></p>

<p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Margrit finally landed a punch on his face. Kapow! He fell on the ground. Nimbus got up, and wiped the blood off his mouth. &ldquo;Is that all your training amounts up to, pathetic sayan?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit grunted, and fired a beam. Boom! Nimbus&rsquo;s shield protected him. Suddenly, Nimbus flew out from the smoke.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s my turn!!&rdquo; He hit her in the air, and as she was falling, he kept hitting</p></p>

<p><p>Her until she fell.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Is that all you got?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I was just starting. That was just a warm up!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; They charged and hit in the air. Each time they hit, a shockwave was produced. Bam. Bam. They flew in circles and hit again. Bam.</p></p>

<p><p>(I&rsquo;m going to avenge you, master. Just wait!)</p></p>

<p><p>When they were flying around, the ground looked so small. Bam! As they flew upside down, the world seemed to be going in circles around them.</p></p>

<p><p>Master Lotus: &ldquo;You have an edge in the air, Margarita, something which most warriors do not have. You must use that to your advantage. You like to be free, like a bird. Land combat is too restrictive for you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Bam! Bam!</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;But in air combat, you must remember the following. This could be life or death. Don&rsquo;t fly too high, for you might have trouble breathing at higher altitudes. And the higher you go, the more dangerous it is for you if you should fall. Gravity is different on every planet. But regardless what planet you are on, if you fall, you are likely to break every bone in your body. You must remember this, Margarita.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They hit again. Bam! Then, they both powered up and hit. Bam! They were pushing each other up and down. Nimbus&rsquo;s push overpowered Margrit, and she lost control of herself. Nimbus whacked her down.</p></p>

<p><p>(I&rsquo;m falling&#8230;)</p></p>

<p><p>It looks like her master&rsquo;s words were true. What now?</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;A true warrior&#8230;is not one who never loses. But one who falls and gets back up. No matter how hard it is.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Before she hit the ground, she regained control of herself, and floated. Nimbus hit her, knocking her into the ground. Boom! Now she was six feet under.</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus landed. &ldquo;How pathetic. And here I was, expecting some worthy competition. She seemed so promising at first.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, the rocks blew up, and Margrit was standing. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t count your chickens before they hatch, Nimbus!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus&rsquo;s expression stayed the same. Margrit charged and slammed him against the wall. Wham! She kept punching his face, and he punched her chin, knocking her away, she landed on her feet.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Finally, some worthy competition.&rdquo; he said. He fired the Wrath Beam.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That move!&rdquo; Margrit said, recognizing it. She countered with the Wrath Beam. Boom! The energies collided. The glass part on Margrit&rsquo;s scouter broke. The ear piece was still intact.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell heard the explosion from Margrit&rsquo;s side, since his scouter is linked to hers. They can hear each other. &ldquo;Oh no&#8230;Margarita&#8230;&rdquo; He quickly went back on guard, as Destructo kept firing energy balls at him.</p></p>

<p><p>At this point, Nimbus powered up to the fullest. Red energy surrounded him. Margarita: (No way&#8230;this is his true power?)</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus charged, and Margarita noticed how fast he is. But that won&rsquo;t help her if she can&rsquo;t dodge it. Wham! He kept on hitting her, slamming her into a rock. Margrit bounced up and went to the air. She fired a bunch of beams, not watching her energy consumption. Nimbus dodged as he flew up, and hit her in the stomach. Thud. She was adrift, and Nimbus blurred, got behind her, and hit her. Whooosh. He appeared in front of her, and hit her. Whoosh. He kept on hitting her, as she couldn&rsquo;t do anything. Wham. Wham. It was like she&rsquo;s a ball in the air.</p></p>

<p><p>Lotus: &ldquo;You have many strengths. But one of your weaknesses is your reckless use of energy. You may have a lot of stamina, but if you use your energy recklessly, you will tire out sooner than your opponent. And that is fatal.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit landed on the floor with a splat. She found it very hard to get up. But she did. &ldquo;Ugh&#8230;damn it&#8230;&rdquo; This guy is definitely nothing she&rsquo;s faced before. He&rsquo;s worse than that level 20 cyborg in the Simulator. Definitely.</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus landed. &ldquo;Pathetic. You&rsquo;re just a weakling. Like your father.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit breathed hard and coughed. It became more difficult to stand up.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Right, Margarita&#8230;<strong>Florencia</strong>? You didn&rsquo;t I&rsquo;d come here without researching, now, did you? I work for Vegeta. And I know he killed your father a few years ago.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> Margarita tried to balance herself. &ldquo;So&#8230;you work for Vegeta. Good. He took something from me, and I&rsquo;ll take something from him. Namely, your life. And eventually, I&rsquo;m going to kill Vegeta myself.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nimbus laughed at her remark. &ldquo;You are an idiot! You&rsquo;ve got your father&rsquo;s brains, don&rsquo;t you? You&rsquo;re not even close to beating me. You&rsquo;re going to suffer the same fate as Jeremiah. He was a <strong>weakling</strong>. Just like you are.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>That word again. She deeply hated that word, especially when someone calls her that. Weakling&#8230; you are just too weak.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&#8230;call&#8230;me&#8230;that&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Does the truth hurt?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit jumped and punched, Nimbus blocked the fist effortlessly. Margrit was shocked, and she pushed as hard as she could. Nimbus dived his other fist into her stomach. Thud. &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; She fell hard.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell: &ldquo;Margarita! You alright?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Yeah&#8230;don&rsquo;t worry about me. I&rsquo;m fine. But this guy won&rsquo;t be.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Listen, you have to run away while you can. He is Nimbus, after all.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah yeah, whatever.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Margarita!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Running away will take the fun out of it, won&rsquo;t it? We&rsquo;ve been taught to face the enemy rather than run away. That&rsquo;s the coward&rsquo;s way! Clinging on to life. Without dignity or pride.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Margarita!&rdquo; Jerrell screamed into the ear piece, and he ran away from a fireball. Destructo found him, and fired non-stop.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell was covered by the smoke. Suddenly, Destructo flew into the smoke and hit him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh, just like all the weaklings I&rsquo;ve killed in the past. You are exactly your father&rsquo;s son, Jerrell.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell got up, and his vision was blurry.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Just accept your fate obediently, sayan. The weak can never hope to achieve anything in this world. The strong always prevail, and the weak must submit to them. They can run away, but they&rsquo;ll be running away their whole lives, cowering outside of society in caves. That&rsquo;s what happened to the two other races of Arlia. The Arlians have been driven out of their territory by sayans.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You sure talk like you know it all, for someone who&rsquo;s not a sayan!&rdquo; Jerrell jumped and fired a beam downwards. Destructo appeared above him and knocked him down.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You still don&rsquo;t understand, do you? This is exactly the same thing that is happening in Arlia. It is no longer a war, but an <strong>extermination</strong>. The extermination of the weak. Ha ha ha ha!&rdquo; He pointed. &ldquo;It is the fate of the weak to be dominated by the strong. You cannot escape your fate. The weak are destined to lose.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Be quiet, you punk.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The strong will produce the next generation, and they will be strong too. Because they have the dominant genes. The weak warriors will only produce weak children. It is all in the genes. And you have your father&rsquo;s genes, Jerrell. You have the weak genes. That is why you will lose.&rdquo; Destructo blasted him into a boulder.</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita: &ldquo;Jerrell&#8230;oh no&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, energy came from the rubble. Jerrell stood up, and his cape was waving from all the energy.</p></p>

<p><p>Destructo: &ldquo;What&#8230;this can&rsquo;t be! His power level is increasing!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You are right about one thing, Destructo. You cannot escape fate. I <strong>do</strong> have my father&rsquo;s genes. But my father was <strong>not</strong> a weakling. He was one of the bestsayans who ever lived. And so am I! Hyaaaaah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No! Nooooooo!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell unleashed the Electric Storm. Destructo&rsquo;s injury from before made it hard for him to counter this attack. Zzzzzzzt!</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aaaaah!&rdquo; Destructo was slammed against the wall, under a pile of rubble.</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell was tired, and he couldn&rsquo;t even stand up, so he landed on his butt, leaning against a rock.</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita heard everything that he said to Destructo. &ldquo;Thank you, brother.&rdquo; Now she had even more confidence to fight.</p></p>

<p><p>Florencia&rsquo;s words are very true. One cannot escape his fate. But it is the same fate which he chooses. If you believe you are weak, then by all means, you are. But if you believe you are strong, and you work hard everyday to prove that, then you are.</p></p>

<p><p>Now, only two fights are left unfinished.</p></p>
