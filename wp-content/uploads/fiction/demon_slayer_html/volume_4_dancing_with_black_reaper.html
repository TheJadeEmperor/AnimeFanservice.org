<p> <hr /> <p><a name=&quot;DS_28_A&quot;></a>&#20108;&#21313;&#20843;: Story of the Four Brothers</p>

<p> <p>Sui Long continued to polish his sword in the empty house. By now, everyone has left and he is alone. He continued to polish the sword with an angry look in his eyes. It is unfortunate that no one was here to see the look on his face, for it is the look of someone who was about to do something very irrational. He continued to clean the blade with a hand cloth, a redundant task he has been doing for the past few hours, as his mind was bent on revenge.</p>

<p>He went to Jiang Ye&rsquo;s tombstone and took off his straw hat and mask and stared at the inscription for a long time. It is true what they say, you do not treasure someone until they are gone. Staring at the tombstone, Sui Long had a flash back of his first meeting with the War God.</p>

<p>Sui was on the run from the law. The East Brigade, a unit of law enforcers who work under the high eunuchs, were after him and chased him all the way to the Valley of Death. They were hot on his trail and he went into the valley, thinking that no one will go there because they would be afraid of the rumors. He was right; none of the soldiers would chase him beyond that territory. However, this put him in grave danger.</p>

<p>As Sui walked down the mountainous area, he felt someone following him. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; he asked, looking around cautiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You dare to trespass into the Valley of Death?&rdquo; said a distant voice. Suddenly, a man jumped down and landed behind him.</p>

<p>Sui turned around and saw the War God for the first time &ndash; he was wearing battle armor and a straw hat that covered most of his facial features. Sui Long was startled, but he did not panic like most would. &ldquo;You are the Legendary War God?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Knowing that you still came here? You sure have guts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not come here to fight you.&rdquo; Sui said. &ldquo;I was on the run from the imperials. All I want to do is survive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough of these stories!&rdquo; Genzo drew his sword and charged forward at lightning speed.</p>

<p>Sui Long quickly dodged. *Whoosh* If he had reacted a second too late, it could have been fatal. Obviously, the War God is no mood to listen, and he had no choice but to fight.</p>

<p>Genzo charged at him and slashed. *Clang Cling* They jumped away from each other.</p>

<p>Sui panted for breath. He could not keep up with someone of his opponent&rsquo;s caliber. &ldquo;You truly are as good as the legends say. It must be my unlucky day.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Just because you said that doesn&rsquo;t mean I am going to go easy on you.&rdquo; said Genzo. His Fire Sword began to glow and flames grew out of it.</p>

<p>Sui was shocked. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the legendary artifact the Fire Sword! The fact that you possess it means&#8230;that you&rsquo;re Genzo, one of the Four Brothers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Genzo lowered his head. &ldquo;Since you know my identity, you must die today.&rdquo; He charged and slashed.</p>

<p>Sui dodged, but was hit in the stomach. *Slish* He fell on one knee and stuck his blade to the ground. &ldquo;Ugh&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the War God approached, ready to make a move, Sui put his palm up. &ldquo;I apologize for intruding into your territory&#8230;you truly are as good as the rumors say. I want you to be my master!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sui bowed down with his forehead on the ground. &ldquo;I want you to take me in as your student! You are the best swordsman I have ever come across!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grrr. Is this some sort of joke?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, take me as your disciple&#8230;or finish me off. Either way it is fine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly, Genzo was no longer in a killing mood. The Fire Sword lost its glow and he put it back into its sheath. &ldquo;I do not take students. Now leave.&rdquo; The War God walked away.</p>

<p>At nightfall, everyone was tired and Alex rented out rooms at a local inn. Xiao was exhausted mentally as well as physically, with a wound on her thigh from an arrow. Li had a wound on her shoulder, also from an arrow. Those two fell asleep immediately. But Alex cannot sleep and decided to get out of bed. He searched for Sui Long and expected him to be in his bedroom, but he was not there. He checked the living room, and he also was not there. Apparently he left a note on a table.</p>

<p>Alex read it with wide open eyes. He crumbled it. &ldquo;No&#8230;Sui Long!&rdquo; He ran out of the house.</p>

<p>*Gallop gallop* Sui was now seen riding a horse. He pulled the reins hard, making his horse run at full speed, for he was in a hurry. His heart was aching for revenge, and to him there is no room for hesitation.</p>

<p>The War God came to the mountainous cave and saw the same swordsman he ran into the other day. &ldquo;You again?&rdquo; he muttered out loud.</p>

<p>Sui Long kneeled. &ldquo;I am asking you to accept me as your disciple, Master Genzo!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is not how you address me.&rdquo; replied he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you are Master Genzo, the renowned swordsman. You have the Fire Sword in your possession, which means you are Genzo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Genzo is already dead. He died a long time ago. The person you see before you is a wanted murderer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I!&rdquo; Sui Long replied. &ldquo;I have no place to go, so please, take me as your student!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sure are a persistent one, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sui Long&rsquo;s eyes lit up, as it was a compliment coming from the great one himself. &ldquo;Yes. I will do whatever you say if you accept me. I don&rsquo;t mind the hardships. Just teach me sword craft and I will be completely obedient to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Genzo realized that this person is going to do whatever it takes and will not give up. His continuous refusal will only make him more determined. What a bother, he thought to himself.</p>

<p>Genzo turned around. &ldquo;I do not take students. Leave before I change my mind and you to my death count.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you are not that kind of person, master!&rdquo; Sui Long shouted.</p>

<p>The War God froze for a moment, for those words struck him somehow. Those words have some truth to them&#8230;no, it is not true at all. What would this youngster know about my struggles, he thought to himself. He doesn&rsquo;t understand a thing at all.</p>

<p>Sui Long walked into the courtyard, very well knowing that he could die today. He will either spill the blood of his enemy, or die trying, and that is his resolve. The notorious duo, Jin and Roh, were waiting for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brother, look, he actually came.&rdquo; said Jin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He thinks he can take us alone? I did not think a student of the War God would be so foolish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s underestimating us. I will teach him a lesson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Roh put his arm forward. &ldquo;No. I will do it.&rdquo; said he, walking forward to face his foe.</p>

<p>Sui Long and Roh stared at each other without saying a word. The wind blew hard and the tension of these two forces can be felt right away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You killed Jiang Ye. And today I must avenge him.&rdquo; said the masked man in the straw hat, Sui Long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should&rsquo;ve stayed in the palace where it&rsquo;s safe. Coming here to challenge us directly is a foolish mistake&#8230;and your last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your days are numbered!&rdquo; Sui drew his sword and charged forward. Roh drew his blade as well and they clashed into each other. *Clang* They exchanged a few moves and jumped back.</p>

<p><a name=&quot;DS_28_B&quot;></a>[ B ]</p>

<p>While they were fighting, Alex was hurrying to the scene, panting for breath. He ran a long way, but he must continue, not stopping to rest, for he must save his friend.</p>

<p>*Clang* Roh blocked Sui&rsquo;s attack. &ldquo;Ohh, not bad. You are worthy of being the number one student of the War God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sui grunted as they were in a power lock, and he pushed and Roh stepped back, dodging the swing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite violent, aren&rsquo;t we? I will send you to see your master in hell!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sui Long screamed and charged forward as his enemy charged at him. They went past each other and stood there for a moment. Sui thought he inflicted a wound on Roh, but in fact, it is him who was wounded. His straw hat was cut in half, and his mask fell off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible&#8230;&rdquo; His coughed blood and fell to the ground.</p>

<p>Sui now realized that he had a lost, and victory is not possible at this point. His life is now over, for he had thrown it away. But he had no regrets, for it was his choice to come here. To kill or be killed, that was his motto from day one, and his meeting with Master Genzo were woven by the hands of fate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young man, I must say, I have never met anyone as persistent as you. I shall teach you sword craft.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Genzo&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Roh walked over to the bleeding man and stabbed him one last time, ending his life instantly.</p>

<p>Alex ran to the scene and saw the fallen Sui Long, lying on a pool of his own blood. Then he glared at the Demon Brothers. &ldquo;You&#8230;you did this to him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Roh and his brother Jin jumped over the wall, escaping in their ninja like fashion. Alex, still in shock, walked over to Sui Long. He touched the man&rsquo;s pulse, and thus confirming what he already knew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sui Long&#8230;SUI LONG!&rdquo; Alex screamed at the top of his lungs. His legs grew weak, and he fell on his knees, and continued to scream the name of his friend.</p>

<p>Li arrived, but she was too late. Standing by the entrance, she felt awkward being there, and hid behind the wall, and cried silently.</p>

<p>Tears spilled out of his eyes and rolled down his face as he sobbed. Never did he imagine he&rsquo;d cry this hard; nor did he remember crying this much for anybody before. During Duke Xiang&rsquo;s reign, Shen Long and Sui Long were assigned to be Alex&rsquo;s bodyguards, and the remained as such after Xiang&rsquo;s death. Though they wore masks all the time, Alex trusted them completely. He never thought of them as bodyguards, but allies; no, as friends.</p>

<p>They were there for him when he was attacked by the mercenary Tao, when he raided the palace to save King Liu, and countless other occasions on his journey.</p>

<p>These tears were tears of sadness, anger, and regret; sad that both his friends are gone, anger at the ones who killed Sui Long, and regret that he did not come sooner. Would it have made a difference if he arrived earlier? He will never find out.</p>

<p>The heroes now grieve over two deaths instead of one. It is unfortunate that things turned out this way. If they had stayed in the palace, could their deaths have been prevented? Yet, if Shen Long did not go to rescue his sister, would Xiao Ye and Li Cheng have died instead?</p>

<p>Shen Long wanted to see his sister so badly, he&rsquo;d go to any length to keep her safe, and as a result, shielded her from the rain of arrows. They fell into the devious trap of the Demon Brothers. Sui Long, who always acts with a clear head, upon losing his long time friend, acted out of anger, and lost his life in a duel with Roh Demos. One thing led to another, and there are many possible outcomes that could have occurred, but alas, it is too late to discuss them, for the story must move on.</p>

<p>Everyone is restless from the fighting and grieving. A lot has happened lately and they need some quiet, but there is no time to rest, for they must plan their next step.</p>

<p>Xiao was sitting by herself in the corner, holding onto her weapon while everyone was discussing the next right step.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sui Long ran off by himself to take revenge? What was he thinking?&rdquo; Zi said.</p>

<p>Alex was standing by the window, looking at the sky. &ldquo;Sui Long and Shen Long are gone now. There is nothing we can do to bring them back. We need to save our anger for the battlefield.&rdquo; It was hard for him to say this, but in this situation, he must say this because everyone was depressed and gloomy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is all Liu Zhang&rsquo;s doing. The Demon Brothers are in alliance with him. He is the source of all our troubles&#8230;that traitor eunuch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The problem is that we cannot find him since the rebellion.&rdquo; said Zi.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shu Tai reported to me that his forces broke down a fort in the border of the city.&rdquo; said Alex. &ldquo;They managed to escape Yi Ling. This is bad because once they are outside the city, we have less control because of the distance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Li took out a map. &ldquo;Yi Ling has roads that connect to three other cities, one of them being Yi Ting, called the Commoner&rsquo;s Paradise. It is the biggest province of the kingdom. This is where he would most likely hide to avoid being found. Yi Ting, however, connects to two other cities. They could be anywhere within this area.&rdquo; She made a circle on the map.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is too big of an area to search.&rdquo; Celina commented. &ldquo;We cannot freeze every suspect city. Each one of them has their own magistrates who set their own rules.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This cannot be&#8230;&rdquo; Zi said. &ldquo;How could we have lost track of an entire group of rebels?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This goes to show you how clever Zhang is.&rdquo; Li replied. &ldquo;He is not to be underestimated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heh.&rdquo; Zi said, &ldquo;I bet he&rsquo;s hiding in some cave like a coward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be stupid. Knowing the type of person Zhang is, he always plans ahead. If I were him, I&rsquo;d figure out how to regroup my army and stage my comeback.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To search the entire area that Li mentioned would take too much time.&rdquo; Alex said. &ldquo;Also, how do we know if the magistrate hasn&rsquo;t been bribed by Liu Zhang? There are so many things we need to consider.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know someone who can find them.&rdquo; Xiao said, gaining everyone&rsquo;s attention. She has been silent the whole time, so they assumed that she was still grieving over her brother&rsquo;s death. &ldquo;If we cannot rely on the authorities or the imperials, then there is one organization that can do the job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Li knew the answer. &ldquo;You mean-&rdquo;</p>

<p>Xiao said: &ldquo;The Council of Heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; Alex said, hitting his own palm. &ldquo;They are an information network made up of swordsmen and they have hideouts in all the major provinces. Although they are considered criminals by law, they claim they deliver justice for the good of the country. If anyone can find Liu Zhang, they can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the problem is how do we get into the Council?&rdquo; Celina asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave that to me.&rdquo; said Li. &ldquo;I have connections there.&rdquo; Xiao glanced at Li with much curiosity. She and Li bonded during their trip to and from the temple, so she thought she knew Li well. But it turns out, Li has some surprises up her sleeve. A ninja master, a student of the War God, a member of the temple, and a connection to the Council? Who exactly is Li Cheng? <a href=&quot;file:///C:/Users/E6440-1/Dropbox/My%20Documents/Fiction/Demon%20Slayer%20-%20Main/DS%20(B)%20-%20Volume%204%20-%20Dancing%20with%20the%20Black%20Reaper.doc#_ftn1&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref1&quot; title=&quot;&quot;>[1]</a></p>

<p>Li took her group to see Vincent Chan. &ldquo;Ah Ms. Cheng, I am glad you decided to seek our help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We need the resources of the Council of Heaven to find the traitor lord, Liu Zhang.&rdquo; said Li.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I assure you that you will not regret your decision.&rdquo; said he, putting a fan over his face. &ldquo;Ah, this must be the famous Demon Slayer.&rdquo; He eagerly shook Alex&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;It is an honor to meet you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The honor is all mine.&rdquo; Alex replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, let me introduce you to everybody.&rdquo; said Li. &ldquo;This is of course, my brother, Alex Cheng. This is Xiao Ye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Xiao waved. &ldquo;Hi!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Lady Ce.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Celina bowed. &ldquo;Nice to meet you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And this is Zi Lai, Alex&rsquo;s servant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zi was displeased. (I&rsquo;m a servant now?)</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a pleasure to meet you all, and I hope to become better acquainted with you. I will take you to our secret headquarters. No one followed you here, correct?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve taken precautions, so rest assured. Please take us to the meeting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vincent took them to a backdoor alley, a place in the slums of the province where no one would want to step into. This is the perfect place to have a hideout for an organization of this size. Vincent opened a trap door on the ground which revealed a staircase, thus, they walk down the staircase, only to be met by a steel door. He knocked on the door twice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know that birds cannot fly up to heaven?&rdquo; said a male&rsquo;s voice on the other side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only angels can fly that high.&rdquo; Vincent replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the right password.&rdquo; <strong>Cho</strong> opened the door. &ldquo;Welcome Vincent. Oh, you have company today. Please come in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vincent took the group into a room where there was a golden Buddha statue in the front.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everyone, please remember that now you have been exposed to the Council, you must keep our secrets to yourselves and tell no one. Do not tell outsiders of our activities, especially the authorities. Our bases are located all over the kingdom; this is our headquarters in Yi Ling. In order for our members to recognize one another, we have a password phrase that we use. <strong>The first person says &lsquo;Birds cannot fly up to heaven.&rsquo; The second person will respond with &lsquo;Only angels can fly that high.&rsquo;</strong> The pass phrase changes periodically, and you will be notified only if you are a regular attendee of our meetings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alex was impressed with all the security that this organization is taking. The organization works with the utmost secrecy, and that is why they have never been caught by the East Brigade. &ldquo;Thank you for showing us all this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naturally, because we consider you our comrades.&rdquo; Vincent replied. &ldquo;Even though you&rsquo;re an imperial, Demon Slayer, you are considered a hero amongst our organization. Your name has been mentioned countless times ever since you became famous. However, should you betray us, you will become enemies of the Council, and you will never be forgiven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo; Alex replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our headmaster, Taishi, only speaks to members of the Council of Heaven. Before you meet him, you must agree to be members and abide by our oath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zi had a look of hesitancy on his face, and he glanced at Alex, who glanced at Celina. Xiao, however, stood up. &ldquo;I trust the Council of Heaven, and I have no problem abiding by the oath. Your secrets are safe with us, Mr. Chan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After Xiao&rsquo;s declaration, Zi, Alex, Li, and Celina also agree to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; Vincent said, fanning himself. &ldquo;I know you are in a hurry, so we will do the initiations another time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Celina raised her hand. &ldquo;Did you say that the headmaster&rsquo;s name is Taishi&#8230;could he be <strong>Taishi Tze</strong>, the legendary swordsman and one of the Four Brothers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is precisely him.&rdquo; Cho replied.</p>

<p>The old man they speak of entered the room, and his magnificence can be felt instantly. His long, white beard reached all the way down to his chest. Tradition says that the longer the beard, the wiser that person is, particularly if the beard is white. His eyebrows were long enough to reach his cheekbones, and the hair on his head was long as well. Nearly everything about his appearance is a picturesque example of a powerful and wise man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Greetings, friends. Vincent told me that you would be coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everyone in the group bowed and saluted him. The salute is when one puts his right fist upside down at eye level, and opens his left palm so the two hands meet in the middle. This is a customary salute used to greet someone of higher status or importance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Taishi&#8230;I get to finally meet the legendary person himself.&rdquo; Alex said. &ldquo;You are just as the rumors say, wise and powerful like a dragon.&rdquo; It is a custom to call someone master if they are famous martial artists of a high caliper, even if they are not your master. It shows respect and humility.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have many books written about you, and heard stories of your heroic exploits.&rdquo; said Celina. &ldquo;But reading is one thing, and to meet you in person is a completely different thing. It is an honor to meet you, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taishi rubbed his beard and smiled. &ldquo;Oh ho ho ho. You youngsters do know how to respect your elders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Xiao said: &ldquo;Master Tze&#8230;it really is you. It has been a while, hasn&rsquo;t it? Master!&rdquo; She kneeled before him. &ldquo;Xiao Ye pays respects to Master Tze.&rdquo; Another martial arts custom is to kneel before him and speak in third person to greet one&rsquo;s own master.</p>

<p>The others watched in awe. &ldquo;Does she know him?&rdquo; Zi asked.</p>

<p>Taishi was awed. &ldquo;Xiao Ye&#8230;is that really you? Your eyes are open?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I can see your face at last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are no longer blind. How splendid.&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I assume you know each other?&rdquo; Zi asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Taishi taught me how to use the Walking Crane Style. I happened to run into him one day when I was attacked by a hoodlum. He saved my life and offered to teach me martial arts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now it makes sense.&rdquo; Li said. &ldquo;He taught you how to fight when you could not see. You could not have taught yourself the Walking Crane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who would have known?&rdquo; said Celina. &ldquo;This is a small world after all. Since you are Xiao Ye&rsquo;s master, this means we are all on the same side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taishi stroked his beard. &ldquo;Well said. Please, come with me so we discuss what you are here for.&rdquo; Taishi took the guests into another room.</p>

<p>There are no chairs in this one, except for some mats, so they kneel down. Taishi sat with his legs crossed. A man came in to pour tea for them and promptly left the room.</p>

<p>The old man touched his beard and began. &ldquo;Is that&#8230;&rdquo; he asked, looking at Alex&rsquo;s sheath.</p>

<p>Alex handed the sword to him, and Taishi took it out of its sheath. After careful examination, he said: &ldquo;This is indeed the Fire Sword, the weapon used by Master Genzo. It has been over fifty years since I have seen this sword. He entrusted it to you, so you are the owner of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, this was the last thing he gave me. I never got the chance to repay him&#8230;and now he&rsquo;s&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he leave any last words?&rdquo; inquired Taishi.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I was not there when he was murdered.&rdquo; Alex replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry about the death of your master. He was my comrade for many decades.&rdquo; Taishi handed the sheath back to Alex. &ldquo;Genzo was my most trusted comrade. He was extremely reliable and skillful on the battlefield. His skills far surpass that of mine. He is a true legend, and that is why he was dubbed the War God. Unfortunately no one knew who he truly was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have something to show you.&rdquo; said Li. She gave him the Ice Sword.</p>

<p>Taishi examined it just as he examined the Fire Sword, with a nostalgic look in his eyes. &ldquo;The Legendary Ice Sword&#8230;how did you come into possession of this? Did you steal it from Chu Yen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I took it from Rubble, the Ice Hunter. He was given the Ice Sword from Chu Yen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Xiao also had something to show him. &ldquo;Master Tze, please look at this.&rdquo; She handed him her shell.</p>

<p>The old man&rsquo;s eyes lit up. &ldquo;Ho...can it be?&rdquo; He took the sword and pulled it out of its shell. &ldquo;This is the Thunder Sword...I have not seen it in decades. And how did you come into possession of this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chu Yen gave it to an assassin named Ekin, who I defeated.&rdquo; said Xiao. &ldquo;And now I will return it to its rightful owner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taishi retracted the blade into its shell and handed it back to Xiao. &ldquo;You are the rightful owner now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me? But...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those who lost a legendary weapon do not have the right to keep it. You defeated Ekin and earned the rights to the Thunder Sword.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not knowing what to say, Xiao grew silent. <a href=&quot;file:///C:/Users/E6440-1/Dropbox/My%20Documents/Fiction/Demon%20Slayer%20-%20Main/DS%20(B)%20-%20Volume%204%20-%20Dancing%20with%20the%20Black%20Reaper.doc#_ftn2&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref2&quot; title=&quot;&quot;>[2]</a></p>

<p>Taishi stroked his beard. &ldquo;To think that the Fire Sword, Ice Sword and Thunder Sword are all in the same room. You lot may be young, but you are all exceptional swordsmen brought together by fate.&rdquo; <a href=&quot;file:///C:/Users/E6440-1/Dropbox/My%20Documents/Fiction/Demon%20Slayer%20-%20Main/DS%20(B)%20-%20Volume%204%20-%20Dancing%20with%20the%20Black%20Reaper.doc#_ftn3&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref3&quot; title=&quot;&quot;>[3]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Taishi,&rdquo; said Alex, &ldquo;Vincent told us that you have all the answers that we seek. We have many things to ask you today. We have already lost many of our comrades, and we do not wish to lose more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taishi said: &ldquo;Rumors have it that a swordsman by the name of Ragnarok slain the War God. It is said that he is a true hero and one who represents justice and benevolence. But this Ragnarok person is most likely Chu Yen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Li banged her fist on the table. &ldquo;I knew it! My suspicions were correct. He is the one who killed my master.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He attacked Genzo hoping to take the Fire Sword, however, he had already given it to you, Cheng. Thus, Chu Yen grew upset and killed Genzo. He is a traitor to the Brotherhood. How could this have happened to the Four Brothers&#8230;Genzo, Chu Yen, <strong>Raijun</strong>, and myself&#8230;it was fifty years ago yet I remember it like it was yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Four Brothers stood on a cliff and they raised their swords together. &ldquo;All for one and one for all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We made an oath of brotherhood under heaven after we found the legendary swords. These swords were forged by the <strong>legendary blacksmith Cho&lsquo;Ann</strong>. His background is unknown and nothing is known about him, except that he is exceptionally good; no, he was the best at forging swords. However, before his death, he dispersed the legendary swords to different locations. Each one of us had to go through much hardship to acquire them. I, with the Thunder Sword, Raijun with the Wind Sword, Chu Yen, wielding his Ice Sword, and Genzo holding his Fire Sword &ndash; we were invincible.</p>

<p>After we formed the pact of brotherhood, we drove the demons out of our land. The land that you live in now&#8230;is no longer infested by demons thanks to the work we did. We were at the height of our careers, and back then I was young and at the peak of my physical abilities. But things only went downhill from there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did the Brotherhood fall apart? Was it because of Chu Yen?&rdquo; Li asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is precisely as you said. Every tragedy that occurred was because of him. Being the youngest one of the four, he was physically strong but mentally unstable. He turned against us before we knew what happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name=&quot;DS_28_C&quot;></a>[ C ]</p>

<p>One day, in the old city of <strong>Seiruun</strong>, a soldier was harassing a girl on the</p>

<p>street. He was holding her arm while she tried to get away. &ldquo;Come on baby, let&rsquo;s go on a date.&rdquo;<br>  &ldquo;Let me go, you jerk!&rdquo; she pushed him away, and made a run for it.</p>

<p>He grabbed her hand. &ldquo;You refuse me? It&rsquo;s a privilege you won&rsquo;t get in ten lifetimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly, a tomato was thrown at the soldier&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Who dares?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man who did it was a friend of the girl, and the girl ran to him and hid behind him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go around and harass whoever you feel like.&rdquo; yelled the young man.</p>

<p>The soldier approaches him. &ldquo;How dare you&#8230;do you know who I am? I am a Red Soldier!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tch. Just because you&rsquo;re a Red Soldier doesn&rsquo;t mean you can do as you please. The Red Army is supposed to protect the citizens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The soldier became more displeased. &ldquo;You insolent&#8230;&rdquo; He drew a sword and pointed it at that man&rsquo;s neck. &ldquo;Assaulting an officer like me is a crime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl shrieked and the man grew nervous. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to arrest me, do it. Leave her out of this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have no say in the matter.&rdquo; A hand touched the troop&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Upon seeing one of the Four Brothers, his attitude quickly changed. &ldquo;Master Genzo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let them go. A Red Soldier like you can be forgiving, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;B-But he assaulted me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A tomato in the face can hardly be called an assault. Maybe he wanted to give you free food? These people are my friends. Give me face and let them go.&rdquo; said Genzo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my lord.&rdquo; The troop turned to the girl and the young man. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in luck today.&rdquo; With that, he walked away.</p>

<p>The girl and her protector thanked Genzo a dozen times. Genzo, however, remained modest and insisted they do not need to pay him back.</p>

<p>Later on, Genzo confronted Chu Yen regarding the matter. &ldquo;Chu, you are getting too arrogant. Your soldiers are becoming like you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo; Chu replied. &ldquo;We have agreed to split the country into four sections, and each one of us will rule our own section. I know how to govern my section, the Red Province.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you have done a poor job, Chu. Your soldiers are spoiled and arrogant, and they show no regard for the well being of the people. Your leadership is lacking and it is being revealed in the morale of the Red Soldiers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chu turned around. &ldquo;Tch, listen Genzo, you have no right to tell me how to govern my territory. You worry about running your territory. I do not need you to teach me how it is done.&rdquo; He walked away, leaving a bitter feeling between them.</p>

<p>That was merely one incident in which those bitter feelings were revealed. Chu Yen and Genzo have often argued in front of Raijun and Taishi. Genzo usually has the final say because he is the senior and he is wiser than Chu is, which makes Chu frustrated.</p>

<p>Chu sat by the window in the dark, looking out the tower. He was extremely displeased with Genzo, who happens to be the leader of the Brotherhood. He feels superior to the other three, and feels that Genzo is holding him back. (How dare he&#8230;trespass into my territory? I have had it with Genzo.) Over that night, he thought long and hard, and came up with a solution.</p>

<p>Taishi and Raijun burst into the room, upon hearing the urgent news. &ldquo;Chu, what happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Genzo took the Fire Sword, and he stole the other three legendary swords as well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; Raijun asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible!&rdquo; Taishi said. &ldquo;Why would he do such a thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It had to be him!&rdquo; Chu replied. &ldquo;Only we have access to the swords. Genzo has been planning this from the beginning. He wants all the power for himself. I have already put a search party for him, and once they see him, he is to be arrested!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taishi put his hand on Chu&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Hold on, we do not have all the facts yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chu shook his hand off. &ldquo;Tch. If not Genzo, then who did it? Do you think it was me? Or perhaps it is one of you two?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taishi and Raijun remained silent.</p>

<p>Genzo was walking peacefully along the road, and suddenly, Red Soldiers appeared in front of him. Behind him, two other troops appeared. Chu Yen revealed himself. &ldquo;Where are you going, Masai Genzo?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yen, what is the meaning of this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Funny, I should be asking you that question. Where have you taken the other three legendary swords?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stolen? What are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You dare betray the Four Brothers. You are a disgrace, Masai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Genzo suddenly realized what Chu was up to. &ldquo;You are framing me for stealing them? That is low, even for you, Yen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chu smiled. &ldquo;Hand over the swords or else&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The troops pointed their swords at him and stepped forward. Genzo drew the Fire Sword and fought his way through. *Slash* He ran away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After him!&rdquo; Chu yelled. &ldquo;Get that traitor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taishi continued his lengthy explanation. &ldquo;Ever since that day, Masai Genzo became a fugitive. He was no longer our leader, but a criminal, and he could no longer stay in his own territory, and escaped to the wilderness. He reached a place called the Deep Valley, but later it became known as the Valley of Death. I have not see Master Genzo since that day. Over time, his real name was forgotten, and he became the War God.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we were too late to catch on to Yen&rsquo;s plot. By the time we figured it out, he framed us for treason as well. It is a good thing that Raijun escaped with the Wind Sword, and Genzo took the Fire Sword with him. I lost my Thunder Sword and was expelled from my own territory. I too, became a fugitive, but I fought back my own way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that is what happened on that day.&rdquo; said Li. &ldquo;It is all starting to add up now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happened to Raijun?&rdquo; Alex asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His whereabouts are still unknown to this very day.&rdquo; Taishi said. &ldquo;My information network covers all four kingdoms, yet I am still unable to find him. He is the type of person who can never be found if he wishes not to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could it be possible that he killed Master Genzo?&rdquo; Alex inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Taishi said. &ldquo;He is the least likely one to do so, he was always on Genzo&rsquo;s side, and he is not the traitor type. It had to be Chu Yen&#8230;who has now renamed himself to Ragnarok. His name is now famous in the martial arts world. This is probably what he planned&#8230;to spread the name of Ragnarok to gain support of the martial arts world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was him&#8230;I saw him in the palace.&rdquo; Li said, clenching a fist. &ldquo;I am sure of it. He is Liu Zhang&rsquo;s student.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alex suddenly recalled fighting someone during the Red Feather Rebellion with exceptional skill. His opponent, however, never introduced himself, but his face resembles that of Taishi&rsquo;s description &ndash; a young, arrogant fighter who wears a yin-yang headband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Liu Zhang is the one who turned Chu Yen against us&#8230;at least that is what he calls himself today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Celina. &ldquo;Did he have a name prior to that one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The demon&rsquo;s original name was Ko-Rashm. He renamed himself Liu Zhang so he can hide himself within the royal family.&rdquo; Taishi explained. &ldquo;This crafty demon changes his appearance and identity every few decades.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But in the Liu family, there <strong>is</strong> someone named Liu Zhang who is a distant relative of Liu Bei.&rdquo; Celina said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The real Liu Zhang was killed by Ko-Rashm a long time ago. I suspect the same thing happened to Duke Xiang. The demon killed the duke and changed its appearance to that of the duke, and waited for the right time to strike.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;According to what you said, Master Tze, there could be more demons lurking in the palace?&rdquo; said Li.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is quite possible.&rdquo; Taishi replied, rubbing his beard. &ldquo;We have not confirmed if there are any more demons being disguised as eunuchs or high-ranking nobles, but do not be surprised if there are. Liu Zhang is a clever one and always has elaborate schemes. You must take caution when dealing with him, for he is a formidable foe in skill and intelligence. This demon has been alive for five hundred years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Xiao nearly spit out her tea. &ldquo;Five hundred years?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ko-Rashm, or Liu Zhang, as he is known, has mastered virtually every sword style and martial arts style in the world during his five hundred years of existence. He is familiar with all of your fighting styles and every stance and combination in association with it. This demon, who has defeated countless masters, is called the <strong>Vanishing Warrior</strong>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Vanishing Warrior? I&rsquo;ve heard of it somewhere.&rdquo; said Li.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the name suggests, he shows up, kills everyone in sight and vanishes without a trace. Over the centuries, countless deaths of martial arts experts have remained unsolved&#8230;these deaths have been spread all over the country. It is believed to be done by the same demon, and in folklore he is called the Vanishing Warrior. He is probably the single deadliest swordsman in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everyone was too shocked for words. Alex suddenly remembered something that Liu Cao told him: Take caution when dealing with Liu Zhang, he is stronger than you think he is. Alex felt extremely uncomfortable and he spoke up. &ldquo;So this is the enemy that we&rsquo;ve been dealing with&#8230;someone who has five hundred years of combat experience&#8230;and to top it off, he has Chu Yen under his wing. Our enemy is this strong?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if he is unbeatable, he is only one man.&rdquo; Li said, being her usual arrogant self.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is one man with one of the Four Brothers as his disciple, and an entire army of rebels who are willing to follow his orders.&rdquo; said Zi, nullifying Li&rsquo;s statement. &ldquo;He single handedly caused the death of the former king, started a rebellion and injured our current king. Also, the Demon Brothers are somehow under his command. Duke Xiang was probably one of his subordinates. This is someone we cannot take lightly&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He also has financial backing from three of the high eunuchs who served under Liu Bei &ndash; Lord Huong, Lord Sima and Lord Fei. I am afraid that this one may be too big for us.&rdquo; said Celina, clenching her fists on her lap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our foe may be powerful, but it is not impossible to defeat him.&rdquo; said Taishi, making everyone feel a little at ease. &ldquo;This is what the Council of Heaven is designed for, to deal with situations like these. Our purpose is to protect mankind from being corrupted by evil, whether the evil are demons or humans. We shall further discuss this at another time. You are now members of the Council, so please do not act without consulting with me first. It is getting late, why not take a rest? I will have my men prepare your quarters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Master Tze. That information was extremely valuable.&rdquo; said Alex. He and everyone else stood up and left the room.</p>

<p>After hearing something so unsettling, Alex had to find out the truth for himself. Celina suggested they do research in the imperial library, the biggest source of knowledge in the kingdom. They went alone since they were the only ones who had access to the library.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow.&rdquo; Alex exclaimed. This is his first time in the library and he was awed at how big it was. Celina&rsquo;s description of &ldquo;big&rdquo; is an understatement. There were countless shelves with spacious aisles in between. Each shelf stacked up as tall as the ceiling and the books on the top required a ladder to reach them.</p>

<p>Celina&rsquo;s reaction was the complete opposite since she spent much time here as a concubine. In her free time she&rsquo;d come here to write letters to Liu Cao, her only penpal. Tai was her trusted friend but he was always busy with duties and they never had time to chat. When she&rsquo;s not writing letters, she&rsquo;d read books in her areas of interest - the history of sword styles, the art of doctoring, and politics. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s begin, shall we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uhhh you&rsquo;ve been here before right? I may need some guidance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Celina smiled. &ldquo;Mmm. Of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After hours of searching, Celina found a book of relevance. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; She flipped the pages. &ldquo;I found the records of the Liu family&rsquo;s history. Liu Zhang&rsquo;s record is on page 300. And here&rsquo;s a picture of him.&rdquo; The picture of Liu Zhang was done in black ink, it was rough but detailed. The man had a pointy black beard with a mustache to compliment it, and wearing a lord&rsquo;s hat. They have seen Liu Zhang in person and the picture is nearly a perfect representation of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Celina, look at this.&rdquo; Alex put down a book and flipped the pages. &ldquo;Here is a record of the eunuchs and warlords during the Han Dynasty. This is the crazy part.&rdquo; There were portraits of all the warlords...and one of them was named <strong>A&rsquo;Chang</strong> and his face was the same as Liu Zhang&rsquo;s. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that record was over 100 years ago!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The artists who drew this were the best of their time. There is no mistake about it. I&rsquo;m sure if I look up prior records of the Han Dynasty, more portraits of him will show up. Taishi is right about him being the Vanishing Warrior...he&rsquo;s over <strong>500 years old</strong>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the talk, Taishi sat by himself in the empty room. He was no longer in the mood to drink tea. The information he gave out was confidential, yet he felt it was right time to tell the youngsters&#8230;because he has a feeling that these ambitious individuals can change the future of the Council.</p>

<p>There are still many uncertain things, however. Was the War God&rsquo;s death part of Liu Zhang&rsquo;s ploy, or was it Chu Yen acting on his own? Taishi has been trying to catch the Vanishing Warrior for fifty years. Not only is the enemy 500 years old, but he has mastered every sword style that has ever existed, is a master of politics and a mastermind. Can he really defeat this ancient and powerful foe?</p>

<p> <hr /> <p><a name=&quot;DS_29_A&quot;></a>&#20108;&#21313;&#20061;: The Calm Before the Storm: Taishi's Training</p>

<p> <p>After Jiang Ye&rsquo;s tragic and untimely death, his old friend Sui Long goes to challenge Roh to avenge him, but he failed and became a casualty himself. After losing two valuable friends, the heroes went into lamentation and seek a new answer in their quest. It was Xiao Ye who then suggested they visit the Council of Heaven, where the famous Taishi Tze awaits them. Being one of the former Four Brothers, as well as headmaster of the most impressive information network in the kingdom, Taishi tells them of many things that are related to the past and present. Their enemy is no ordinary foe, for he is the 500 year old Vanishing Warrior. After hearing such disturbing news, the heroes now realize they have a long way to go before they can fight such a powerful enemy&#8230;</p>

<p>As instructed by Alex, Zi is to return to the palace to help finish the reparations. Tai happened to see him and approached him to talk. &ldquo;Zi. How are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, thank you, Captain Tai.&rdquo; replied he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The reparations are almost complete, as I can see. You have done well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, don&rsquo;t say that. This is not a job that I&rsquo;m cutout for.&rdquo; said Zi.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Managing something like this just isn&rsquo;t for me. All this fighting and killing isn&rsquo;t for me either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you are Alex&rsquo;s servant, aren&rsquo;t you. I&rsquo;m sorry, I meant his friend.&rdquo; said Tai. &ldquo;You have been with him since the beginning.&rdquo; <br>  &ldquo;I know. But with Sui Long and Shen Long&rsquo;s death, I have a feeling that things are only going to get worse&#8230;Alex is not going to stop here. I just want to live a peaceful life, like that of a wealthy man, to eat well and have fun with lots of women. I don&rsquo;t know about anything else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand.&rdquo; replied Tai. &ldquo;But you are choosing to stay here, no? You can flee any time you want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; Zi replied. &ldquo;I guess this stuff is too interesting to leave behind. Being with Alex never gets boring. He&rsquo;s always running into trouble&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Xiao and Taishi, drawing their swords, were ready for combat. &ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; her master asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; she replied.</p>

<p>Without uttering another word, the two engaged in swordplay, exchanging moves at the caliper of experts. *Cling cling* Their sparring is friendly, yet serious at the same time.</p>

<p>They both use the Walking Crane style, for it is Taishi who taught Xiao how to fight, starting from that day many moons ago. Although she was not a Council member then, he decided to make an exception and teach her swordcraft because he thought Xiao had potential for someone who was blind.</p>

<p>The Walking Crane draws its origins from that of a grasshopper. It is an insect that is silent, yet deadly at the same time. It strikes suddenly, and its claws are sharp and fatal. The grasshopper can blend itself into the grass easily, as it hides and stalks its prey, and it can jump rather high, going from each strand of grass with ease. Such is the essence of the Walking Crane &ndash; to strike where one is not expected, and making each strike count, with variations of slow and quick movements to throw the enemy off. The attacks range from high strikes to very low strikes, also as a way to fool the opponent.</p>

<p>Over the decades, many forms of Walking Crane have developed; however, the original, pure form of the Walking Crane Style was founded by none other than Master Taishi himself. He states that the other styles are mere imitations, only he uses the true Walking Crane, and in this instance, both student and master are using the true style.</p>

<p>*Clang* Taishi was on the offensive, using thrusts of the sword while he advances using footwork. The purpose of this spar is not to train, but to see how much Xiao has improved over the years.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, two minutes into the fight, her stamina runs low, and her defense weakens as Taishi advances. At some point, they both give the eye signal and stopped fighting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve improved, Xiao Ye.&rdquo; said the master. &ldquo;But not as much as I expected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the same.&rdquo; she said, sweating heavily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fighting while not seeing, and fighting while seeing are two different things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmmm. I see. When did your eyes heal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only recently, master.&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That is why I am not used to it. There are so many things about this world that I do not understand, such as why the sun hurts my eyes whenever I look at it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly, Taishi thought of something and threw her a blindfold. &ldquo;Here, put this on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put this on? But what is the purpose of that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us see if you fight any different in darkness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Xiao was confused, but she decided to trust her master and do as he suggests. She proceeded to blindfold herself, tying the knot on the back of her head, and stood there motionlessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, I want you to attack me head on.&rdquo; said Taishi.</p>

<p>Xiao held the sword with a tight grip, and stood in fighting position. Once again, she is in the world of darkness, and must use her ears and other senses to retrieve information. Since the courtyard is silent, with the exception of the wind, she can hear every little sound that is not natural. Indeed, now she can &ldquo;see&rdquo; the whole courtyard, starting from the ground she was standing on. The wind blew against the tree, and from that, she can determine the tree&rsquo;s shape and size, and everything about it, including every single branch and leaf that falls off.</p>

<p>As Taishi makes his first step, she can determine his exact location, based on the vibration of his foot against the concrete. She also knew his exact height and body shape. Although she is not able to see his face, she can clearly see his limbs, both arms and legs, and their movements. She can see the length of his sword, as it brushes the air. *Whoosh*</p>

<p>In her mind&rsquo;s eye, Taishi is now a figure with outlines. The details are blank, such as his face and his clothes, but each movement he makes is clear and concise. Each of his footsteps creates a wave-like vibration against the ground, much like how a pebble is thrown in water.</p>

<p>Before the blindfold came on, she knew the distance between them. This, added to all the information she has now, is more than enough for her to fight. Xiao screamed and charged forward. *Froom* Each of her footsteps also creates a vibration, the harder the step, the bigger the vibration.</p>

<p>Now at attacking distance, she strikes. *Clang* Taishi blocked it and continued to move back as Xiao advanced. *Clang*</p>

<p>After blocking three more of her attacks, Taishi retaliated. They continued to clash blades, moving back and forth, at almost the same speed. Their movements were quick and swift, deadly and unforeseen, except to each other.</p>

<p>Xiao&rsquo;s movements began to flow more easily, the sounds of metal banging each other became music to her ears, and the wind became a warm breeze upon her cheeks. To be able to do and feel all these things is no easy task, and is something she does not take for granted.</p>

<p>At this close distance, she can smell the scent of a male. Normally, she can smell fear and hesitation, but since it is Taishi, she senses no such feelings from him.</p>

<p>When practice was over, Xiao removed the blindfold. &ldquo;You are right, master. This is completely different. My movements felt so natural&#8230;and I can see you clearly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were using your mind&rsquo;s eye.&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;When your eyes are open, you hesitate to attack, and thus you became crippled. This is because you are not used to seeing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Xiao began to understand her master&rsquo;s wisdom. &ldquo;I see&#8230;somehow I fight better when I choose not to use my vision.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not necessarily.&rdquo; Taishi retorted. &ldquo;It applies in only certain situations. The advantage of fighting blind is that you will not be distracted by the sun&rsquo;s bright rays, nor other things related to nature. Such as that of rain, or mist, things that may block your vision. Other fighter&rsquo;s disability is your advantage. But, fighting without using your eyes can be detrimental at times, Xiao. For example, if you were fighting where there is noise, then you&rsquo;d not be able to concentrate on your enemy. You cannot see him, nor can you hear him due to the distractions. In that situation, you&rsquo;d lose two of your senses, and that will be your demise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Xiao listened carefully to watch Taishi said. His words become truer and truer by the moment, and she realized that her trip to the Temple had not been a waste.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Xiao, you once told me that you can tell someone&rsquo;s emotions using your mind&rsquo;s eye, correct?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; she replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet without vision, you cannot see one&rsquo;s face. How would you tell a foe from friend during a battle? As a matter of fact, you will not able to see what is not moving, such as pebble on the ground. An animate object like that creates no vibrations, and you can trip over it and be at the mercy of your enemy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How true indeed, for that scenario actually happened back at the Temple.</p>

<p>Xiao listened hard for those footsteps, but all she heard were the noises that the students were making. By the time she heard the footsteps, he was already two paces away. Whoosh. She jumped away and avoided a fatal hit.</p>

<p>Guan continued to push her further with his circular attacks. Xiao stepped back while defending, and her foot stepped on a pebble and she almost tripped. Guan took this chance and swings his blade as to knock the sword out of her hand. He pointed the sword at her chin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You lose, Miss Ye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have proven your point.&rdquo; Xiao walked over to her sword to pick it up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In essence, there are two worlds - that of darkness and of light. One has information that the other has not. You can think of your senses as filters&#8230;each sense filters out information that the other senses do not. You have the unique ability to fight with or without your eyes. I cannot even name a single warrior who can perform a feat such as you... You are true prodigy and I truly believe that you can defeat any swordsman in single combat, provided enough training and time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even you, master?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taishi laughed. &ldquo;Your eyes are bigger than your heart, no pun intended.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name=&quot;DS_29_B&quot;></a>[ B ]</p>

<p>Xiao was not the only one who was practicing hard. *Whoosh* Alex stabs his sword against the air, maneuvering it according to the stances that he was taught. His movements were circular and fluid, not rigid and mechanical, like many swordsman are.</p>

<p>Standing behind one of the columns stood Celina. She was not hiding, yet not revealing herself completely, as she watched curiously. Ever since that time she spied on him in the palace, she had this habit of watching Alex when he practiced. For Alex, this is just a routine, but his training is somehow enchanting for her, as she was watching a show. Through his routine, she gets to discover the real Alex; the dedicated worker, the passionate and loving one, the one who is not afraid to sweat to get what he wants.</p>

<p>At first, she&rsquo;d hide herself completely, not wanting to interrupt him. She has always been shy like that, particularly around men, but with Alex it is different. Since their relationship has changed, she can openly talk to him even when he is training.</p>

<p>When Alex stopped the movements to take a break, Celina went to the courtyard. &ldquo;Are you tired?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Why not take a break and drink some water with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I appreciate you caring for me, Celina, but I do not want to rest.&rdquo; Alex replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you have been training all morning. Even a swordsman like you needs to rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just cannot settle down right now&#8230;especially after knowing Zhang&rsquo;s true identity. I feel like I am falling so far behind. You heard Taishi, right? He has been fighting for hundreds of years. Damn it&#8230;our enemy is too far fetched to comprehend. I am not even confident if I can fight Chu Yen on even ground&#8230;how will I avenge my master? &rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alex&#8230;&rdquo; Celina murmured. It pains her to see him so frustrated and lost. It is clear that he wants to be stronger, and this desire has caused him to work very hard at his swordcraft. But he feels like he is making no progress. If only he had a master, or a training partner&#8230;and the thought suddenly hit her. &ldquo;If you want, I can be your training partner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her eyes told him she meant it. He just had flashbacks of her Dance of the Sword Style - she used those fluid, graceful movements to defeat many foes at once. &ldquo;Very well then. I&rsquo;d love to have you spar with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without further ado, the two barred their weapons at each other and stood in their respective fighting stances. Celina, as usual, held two swords, both facing forward, one low and one high, below the stomach and over her head. In this society, a couple is not supposed to spar with each other because it is not befitting the image of the perfect woman. Female swordsmen are rare, and female swordsmen in a relationship are even rarer, an archetype that is unheard of. It is shameful because the man let the woman hold a sword, so to speak. Yet for these two, it is completely natural for them, and the thought of shame never even occurred once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; Alex asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo; she replied.</p>

<p>Given the nature of their relationship, they just want to feel each other out. Obviously they do not want to injure each other. In martial arts schools or soldier&rsquo;s training camps, sometimes men take sparring too seriously and act is if it&rsquo;s a real fight. A good sparring partner is as rare as a precious diamond.</p>

<p>They stood in fighting stance and waited for the moment to attack...the wind blew hard. Suddenly, both of them charged at the same time and they clashed blades. The Dance of the Sword was taught to her by Master Fa, who learned it from her master long ago. It is a sword style used by dancers of the Mu Fa Theatre. Although it is not illegal, it is frowned upon for women to learn martial arts.</p>

<p>One day, a certain dancer found a way to hide her martial art in the form of dance. The dance moves were the same as the attack moves. It was a brilliant way to hide her skill. She would dance by day and use swordcraft by night when no one was watching. Over the years she kept refining her skills and it became the Dance of the Sword known today.</p>

<p>*Clang clang* Alex had difficulty keeping up with Celina&rsquo;s footwork. One second she&rsquo;s to his left, the next second she&rsquo;s to his right. *Clang clang* Her movements are graceful like swan but deadly like a tiger. He has seen her fight only one time, but memorized all her moves.</p>

<p>However, Alex was able to defend against all of her attacks thus far, and he went on the offensive using his Heaven&rsquo;s Wrath Style. He always thought of Master Genzo as the founder of this style, but no, it is actually as ancient as Dance of the Sword. A straightforward style, it uses explosive attacks using brute force, sometimes from the air.</p>

<p>When the time felt right, Celina used the Dance of the Eagle. She held her twin blades crossed over each other like a scissor and charged forward. Usually this attack would cut her victims twice, cutting deep into their bodies. Alex blocked it by holding his blade vertically and stopping her blades at the crossover. *Schhhhling* She continued her relentless attack while Alex defended. At this point they forgot about the fact that this is sparring session and fought as if they were in a match.</p>

<p>Alex felt it was time to use Heaven&rsquo;s Retribution. He dashed forward and unleashed a combination of attacks. *Swipe swipe swipe* One attack came from overhead. She blocked it. The last attack was a slash at point blank, and Celina blocked with both blades stacked together. With one hand holding each sword, her power was halved, so she has to make it up with speed.</p>

<p>Both of them were at a safe distance and stared for a moment. Celina placed her swords horizontally, one pointing left and the other pointing right. Alex grew cautious as he knew what was coming. &ldquo;Final form: Dance of the Dragon!&rdquo; She started spinning towards him and the blades came at him different angles. He defended himself while retreating. *Cling cling* It became difficult to track where the next attack will come from. Actually, it was more than difficult, it became a desperate situation for him. (Ugh! Is this what it&rsquo;s like to fight someone like her? This is the power of the dragon&rsquo;s dance!)</p>

<p>Just defending took all of his energy. Suddenly, his foot took a wrong step and he stuttered. Celina&rsquo;s blade scraped his shoulder, causing him to drop his sword and fall on one knee. He placed his hand over his bleeding wound. Celina gasped and dropped both swords. &ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo; She helped him stand up and took him back to his quarters.</p>

<p>Celina came into the room with bandages and sat on the bed next to Alex. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I got carried away.&rdquo; She said as she wrapped his wound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. I wasn&rsquo;t able to defend your last attack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve hurt you. I am not a good training partner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He placed his hand on top of her hand. &ldquo;Accidents happen during sparring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence between them. &ldquo;I want tell you about the secret of the Dance of the Dragon.&rdquo; <br>  &ldquo;Wait, you don&rsquo;t have to-&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Dance of the Dragon is the final attack of the Dance of the Sword. You have seen dance moves where the user spins a lot, right? The idea is to use those spinning motions to build momentum, so that each attack becomes stronger. This is offensive and defensive as well. And sometimes we reverse directions so we don&rsquo;t get dizzy. But this technique has a weakness, it is the <strong>dragon&rsquo;s tail</strong>.&rdquo; (&#40857;&#30340;&#23614;&#24052;)</p>

<p>Alex pictured a green dragon and focused on its tail. &ldquo;The dragon&rsquo;s tail? You mean the feet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but more precisely the ankles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;During Dance of the Dragon, the user is spending all of her energy into her attacks, leaving the ankles open. The footwork required to use this powerful technique requires us to put our feet together during the moves. If you were to hit the feet or ankles, the user will trip and fall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alex&rsquo;s eyes grew wider. He flashed back to moment when Celina used the Dance of the Dragon. He did not pay attention to the lower part of her legs, but now that he thought about it, her feet were close together during the spinning motions. &ldquo;I see. That makes sense.&rdquo; He turned to face her and smiled. &ldquo;Thanks Celina.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She blushed a little bit. &ldquo;Well I better let you rest so I should get going.&rdquo; She went towards the door but stopped for a second. She looked like she was about to say something, but decided not to, and opened the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t feel bad for what happened to today.&rdquo; said Alex.</p>

<p>Celina left the room without a reply. Alex placed his hand over his wound. He did not want Celina to feel guilty about it, but knowing her personality, she will definitely feel guilt.</p>

<p><a name=&quot;DS_29_C&quot;></a>[ C ]</p>

<p>When night time falls, Zi was drinking alone on a roof top. He has done much work during the day and feels like he needs to relax. Working isn&rsquo;t his favorite thing to do, but drinking and having a good time is. As he gulfed down half his wine, he saw Li walking on the ground.</p>

<p>He leaped down from the roof and landed in front of her. &ldquo;Hey there, beautiful. Where are you going to on this lovely night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zi Lai? Aren&rsquo;t you supposed to be at the palace?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m done with my duties for the day. Things are finally calming down over there. I&rsquo;m not needed anymore.&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you came here? Are you a member of the Council?&rdquo; asked Li.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha. I can become a member of anything I want, Li.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever.&rdquo; she replied nonchalantly. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind I have business to attend to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Business? Fuhget about business. Hang out with me for the night, won&rsquo;t ya?&rdquo; He proceeded to put his arm around her shoulders.</p>

<p>She pushed his hand off. &ldquo;Get off me you idiot!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How cold.&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Alex and I have been searching for you for so many years&#8230;you don&rsquo;t even know how hard we looked. You should show some appreciation, ya know? How are you going to repay me for my kindness?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Li drew the <strong>Ice Sword</strong> and pointed it at his neck. &ldquo;I can repay you by freezing your face off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zi was surprised and snake bitten. Even though only the tip was touching his skin, he can feel the sword&rsquo;s coldness. He opened his palms and to show he is not a threat. &ldquo;Okay okay&#8230;I get it. I was only joking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frankly, you&rsquo;re annoying. And your attitude towards women is horrendous. I don&rsquo;t know how you ever became friends with Alex.&rdquo; Li withdrew her sword and walked away irritated.</p>

<p>Zi continued to stare at her curiously, as if what happened was just a game.</p>

<p>Tai was summoned to the royal hall and upon entering, he saw just Liu Cao and two eunuchs standing by his side. He kneeled and saluted. &ldquo;Long live the king.&rdquo; Then he stood up. &ldquo;Sire, shouldn&rsquo;t you be resting in your condition?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My wounds are nothing but scratches.&rdquo; replied the king. In truth, he still had bandages under his golden armor and it was still painful, but he Liu Cao is a proud man who values his image above all else. Even if he is near death he will be stubborn until the end. &ldquo;I am unable to find Lady Ce. Do you know where she went?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe she is with Cheng right now. They are not in the palace but somewhere in the capital.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We just had a rebellion and the imperial palace is a mess. Lady Ce is one of the few people that I trust. Where have they gone at a critical time like this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sire. But Cheng is a man of duty. I am sure he is looking for the traitor Liu Zhang as we speak and Lady Ce is helping him.&rdquo; Tai was staring at the floor as he spoke. He honestly did not know where Celina was, but he made up a lie to make her look good.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am certain you know how to find them. Search for them and summon them to the palace. With the traitor out there, no where is safe anymore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you wish, sire.&rdquo; Tai turned around and left the hall.</p>

<p>(Alex and Celina, whatever you need to do, please do it fast and come back. The king is not in a good mood.)</p>

<p>At nighttime, it was deathly silent with the exception of crickets chirping. A Council swordsman was doing his night patrol, holding a lantern. He yawned as he walked under the bridge. Suddenly, a figure of a man in black appeared before him. He was dressed completely in black, with black boots and gloves, as well as a veil that covered his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; asked the swordsman. &ldquo;You are definitely suspicious.&rdquo; He dropped the lantern and drew his word. &ldquo;Yaaaah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Black Reaper dashed forward and drew his sword. *Schling* He blocked the swordsman&rsquo;s attack and slashed him in the torso. Blood squirted out from his wound and he collapsed.</p>

<p>The Black Reaper ran away from the shadow of the bridge, became a black blur. He run towards the wall jumped onto the wall, landed on the awning, and jumped into the window, breaking it. *Crash* He went to the safe and began to break it.</p>

<p>Alex was taking a leisurely stroll at night and yawned. Him and several Council members had a few drinks and he needed time to sober up. As he walked towards the arc under the bridge, he saw a fallen man and became alert. He ran to the corpse to check out. The swordsman had a gash on his torso that ran from his shoulder down to his abdomen and it was a clean cut. He was killed just moments ago and Alex figured the killer must be nearby. He ran away from the bridge&rsquo;s arc and towards the nearest building. Upon entering the courtyard, Alex looked up and saw a blur at the window.</p>

<p>He drew the Fire Sword and jumped onto the awning and jumped into the window. &ldquo;Who are you? Why did you kill one of our men?&rdquo; He noticed the Black Reaper holding a scroll. &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Reaper jumped out the window. Alex jumped out of the window closest to him. They both landed in the courtyard. The Reaper drew his sword and attacked. Him and Alex exchanged a few moves. *Kling-kling* Not wanting to be discovered by others, the Reaper threw a smoke bomb on the floor. Alex coughed and ran away from the smoke. He lost sight of his target.</p>

<p>Li was still annoyed by Zi&rsquo;s approached and she was mumbling something to herself. Suddenly, she sensed unusual movements from the nearby building. She jumped onto the roof in a ninja-like fashion, becoming a blur in the eyes of a normal person.</p>

<p>From the roof&rsquo;s view, she saw the Black Reaper running along the rooftops of the city, running away at high speed. Her eyes grew wide open as if she has soon a ghost, or perhaps the Grim Reaper himself. (That appearance, those movements, there is no doubt that is him&#8230;the Black Reaper.)</p>

<p> Suddenly, those old memories of hers came hurling back again. The tragic event happened long ago, but to her, the vision was so real it felt like it happened yesterday. There was a burning building and many dead bodies on the ground. They were innocent people, some women and old men. Standing before her was the one responsible for this, the Black Reaper.</p>

<p> <hr /> <p><a name=&quot;DS_30_A&quot;></a>&#19977;&#21313;: Mysterious! Who is Under the Shadow's Mask?</p>

<p> <p>Alex was called to the courtyard early in the morning to meet Taishi. Xiao was standing on the side as a curious bystander.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Master Taishi.&rdquo; said Alex. &ldquo;What can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ever since I saw your Fire Sword, I have been curious about something. I want to see if you are truly the student of Masai Genzo and the successor of the Fire Sword. I want you to show me your skills, Cheng.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alex was surprised. &ldquo;You mean, you want me to fight you, sir? But I am no match for someone of your caliper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taishi stroked his beard. &ldquo;Hohoho. I am not asking you to defeat me. Just show me your skills. Think of it as a request from an old man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alex, still unsure, glanced briefly at Xiao. She smiled and nodded. Taking a deep breath, Alex took a few steps forward and took out his sword from his belt. He put it in front of him and pulled out the blade. *Schhhhling*</p>

<p>Taishi whipped out his sword and struck the air several times. He made the sword look as light as a stick. Then he stood in traditional Walking Crane stance - right sword pointed forward, left foot standing, right leg bent and the heel touching the left shin. His left hand was extended, so that both his arms were perpendicular to each other. Alex stood in his fighting stance and the two did the stare for a while. Taishi&rsquo;s stance is exactly the same as Xiao&rsquo;s. But the feeling is the not the same...he already felt the pressure of one of the Four Brothers. The pressure was strong enough to paralyze him, but he had to start somewhere. It is better to be in motion than be stagnant.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Alex charged forward and used basic strikes. Taishi moved back while defending using only one arm. *Schling schling schling* Just after five moves, Alex can see the difference in their skills - Taishi&rsquo;s footwork was so graceful he was as light as a feather. Those movements remind him of Celina. If she moves like a swan, then Taishi moves like a crane. Alex&rsquo;s blade never came close to hitting any of his body parts.</p>

<p>The Fire Sword began to glow red and set a flame. Taishi&rsquo;s eyes opened wide. (Ho...that glow. Those flames. I have not seen it in fifty years.)</p>

<p>Alex swings his blade at different angles, hoping to let the flames touch their target. Taishi knocked his blade out of the way every time. Alex took a swing and nearly hit him, Taishi bent his back and the flame sparks nearly touched his beard. *Froom* Several times the Fire Sword nearly touched his body, but for an old man, he was quite flexible. He kept bending and twisting his torso in different ways to avoid the flame sparks. *froom froom*</p>

<p>Xiao was having an eyeful as she watched in suspense. On the one hand she was marveled at her master&rsquo;s movements, on the other hand, she was shocked by the Fire Sword&rsquo;s abilities. This is the first time she has seen it in action since her eyes have healed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take this! Heat Wave!&rdquo; Alex took a hard swing forward, creating a wave of flames. Taishi jumped onto the roof behind him, and the flames burned the wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho ho. That&rsquo;s a nice attack.&rdquo; Taishi jumped down. &ldquo;But such a one dimensional attack won&rsquo;t phase me.&rdquo;</p>

<p> Alex&rsquo;s heart nearly skipped a beat as he stood in fighting stance. (He called my strongest attack a one dimensional attack. He is a fearsome guy, as expected of Master Genzo&rsquo;s comrade. Simple attacks won&rsquo;t work on him. I have to rely on the Heaven&rsquo;s Wrath Style.)</p>

<p>He charged forward and attacked like before, waiting for the right moment to use his techniques. Taishi kept defending with one hand, while retreating and side-stepping him. Suddenly, Alex released the Infinity Circle, a combination attack using circular movements. Each attack builds on the previous one, becoming stronger and faster with each spin. *Clin-clan-clin-clan*</p>

<p>As expected, Taishi blocked every single strike. &ldquo;Not too shabby. Too bad I have seen that move from Masai Genzo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Demon Slayer panted for breath. (Does Taishi know all of Heaven&rsquo;s Wrath? But that&rsquo;s the only style I know. There&rsquo;s still one more thing I can try.) He charged forward and attacked in his usual manner, starting off slow and gradually increasing the pace. First he struck from the front, then used circular attacks while side-stepping, hoping to find an opening.</p>

<p>He struck his blade forward as a faint. Taishi knocked it away and realized immediately that was a light strike. (Now it&rsquo;s Heaven&rsquo;s Retribution?) He anticipated the next strike will be the real one. Alex took a step forward and was about to deal the blow...but suddenly he jumped to the air, surprising Taishi. *Whoosh* (It&rsquo;s not Heaven&rsquo;s Retribution? It&rsquo;s a combination with Heaven&rsquo;s Light!)</p>

<p>*Clang* Taishi deflected the incoming attack, and both fighters stepped back from the impact.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not too bad.&rdquo; said Taishi. &ldquo;But I have also seen that from Genzo. Now, it&rsquo;s my turn to attack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alex&rsquo;s eyes opened wide as he realized that Taishi was defending all this time. What will he be like when he is on the offensive?</p>

<p>(Alex, don&rsquo;t be intimidated by Master Taishi&rsquo;s skill. Just stay calm and do your best.) Xiao thought.</p>

<p>Taishi dashed forward and went on the offensive. Both their swords were the same length, yet Taishi felt like he had a longer reach. *Whoosh whoosh* Alex defended while side-stepping in circles. But merely blocking the enemy&rsquo;s blade was not enough, he must tilt his head to avoid the incoming blade...It took everything he had just to defend.</p>

<p>Occasionally, Taishi switched arms to prevent shoulder fatigue. He tossed his sword from the right hand to the left hand and switched his stance so his left foot was forward. To Alex, it did not change a thing, for it took everything he had just to avoid Taishi&rsquo;s deadly blade. *Whoosh whoosh*</p>

<p>(At this rate I&rsquo;ll be defeated before I can do anything to him. I can still try <strong>that</strong>.) *Whoosh* Alex tilted his body to the side as Taishi&rsquo;s blade cut off a few pieces of his silver hair. &ldquo;Take this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Xiao&rsquo;s eyes opened wide in anticipation as did Taishi.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaven&rsquo;s Wrath Style: <strong>Melody of the Celestial Maidens!</strong>&rdquo; This attack was a series of circular strikes combined with jumping attacks. Alex&rsquo;s moves were fast and furious, but also graceful and light, much like a dance. Taishi blocked while moving backwards. *Clin-clin-clin* Sparks of flame flew to the air after Alex&rsquo;s strikes, and he kept pushing forward relentlessly.</p>

<p>Taishi blocked the final strike and jumped backwards. Sweat was dripping down his face as he was struggling for the first time. Alex was in even worse shape, as he spent much of his energy to no avail. Taishi Tze saw his chance and dashed forward and attacked. *Whoosh whoosh* His moves were swift and fast and much like the zanzoken, he seemed to be in two places at once. *Clang* He knocked Alex&rsquo;s sword off his hand and pointed his blade at Alex&rsquo;s sternum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that is that.&rdquo; said Tze. &ldquo;You did well, as expected of a student of Master Genzo.&rdquo; He withdrew his sword and Alex took a breath of relief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t do a thing to you, expected of Master Taishi.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, don&rsquo;t compare yourself to me. I&rsquo;ve been doing this my whole life. Ho ho ho.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alex picked up his Fire Sword and Xiao went up to him. &ldquo;You did well, Alex. Those were some amazing moves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, ya think so?&rdquo; he said, rubbing the back of his head.</p>

<p>Vincent was walking on the balcony when he saw Celina at the other end. &ldquo;Greetings Lady Ce.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh hey Vincent.&rdquo; Her gaze was focused on Alex but she snapped out of her trance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you perchance seen Li around?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No I have not seen her all morning, but knowing her, she is always nearby. Perhaps hiding somewhere or in disguise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Vincent noticed her belt which carried two swords. &ldquo;Are you a two handed sword user?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uh yes, is something the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are not many two handed sword users nowadays. Since you are a member I am curious about your style. Are you up for a friendly spar?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Celina smiled and nodded. &ldquo;Mmm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two stood in the center of the courtyard and Celina drew her two blades. &ldquo;Where are your weapons?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are right here.&rdquo; said Vincent, wielding his fans.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You fight with fans?&rdquo; she asked curiously. <br>  &ldquo;They are fans made of metal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never seen someone fight with fans before. This should be interesting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(I wonder if her style is that...) Being a refined gentlemen, Vincent let the lady attack first. His intention was to get a grasp of her style before he went on the offensive. Celina took his invitation and struck first, using her superb footwork and spinning attacks to make use of her double blades. *Clan-clan* Vincent defended all of her strike with his fans. Celina was surprised that his fans were so useful. *Clan-clan* Their range is shorter than her swords, but the fans were more flexible and faster. He can put the two fans together to form a bigger shield before him.</p>

<p>Celina was truly trying to land a strike but was unable to do so, as the fans blocked her attacks at every angle. She could tell Vincent has practiced with fans for a long time.</p>

<p>(So it is Dance of the Sword after all. A rare style used exclusively by females. Today is my lucky day, that I get to see such a style personally.) *Clan-clan* He just blocked another one of her combination attacks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dance of the Tiger!&rdquo; She charged forward and ended up sliding on one knee, thrusting both blades forward, the blades being the fangs of the tiger. Vincent put the fans in the exact spot where the tips of the blades were.</p>

<p>Celina gasped and then she quickly sprang up. &ldquo;Dance of the Lion!&rdquo; Her spinning speed increased, which increases the power of her attacks. To do this motion, one must have excellent footwork. Her feet must keep spinning and not bump into each other, and one misstep will make the entire combination fail. Her blades attacked high and low. *clin-clan-clin* Vincent defended against all attacks no matter how fast or hard they were.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Next form: Dance of the Eagle!&rdquo; She put her blades forward and opened them at the front like a pair of scissors. Vincent put his fans together, aiming at the center of the opening of the blades, and then pushed them apart. *Whoop* Her face was within range and he swiped at her face. She dashed away just in time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good.&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have shown me a lot. Now, allow me to return the favor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Celina&rsquo;s eyes squinted and her eyebrows narrowed. Vincent went on the offensive. Because of their shorter range, he must swing his arms more to generate sufficient power, which would leave gaps between attacks. But Vincent&rsquo;s speed leaves no gap whatsoever between his strikes. Occasionally, he uses spinning attacks, but not as much as Celina does. This sort of fighting is much more suited for him than a regular sword. He had these fans custom made after many experiments. It is a style he developed for himself and something he refined over the years, and it showed in his moves.</p>

<p>Vincent threw his fan at her sword, and it bounced back to his hand. He threw it again, only to bounce back. He threw both fans, one at a time, relentlessly, pushing Celina back. It may seem like a simple attack, but she was unable to advance or stand her ground, she had to retreat. *Clunk-clunk-clunk*</p>

<p>Suddenly, he dashed forward and attacked like before, swinging both fans furiously. Celina blocked methodically and carefully while waiting for a chance to counter. At this point, both fighters exchanged blows, not focused on either defense or offense, but doing whatever they felt was right.</p>

<p>Unbeknownst to them, Li was watching the fight from the rooftop. She has only seen Lady Ce fight one other time, but that time she was watching from far away. But now, she gets to see her fight up close. (Dance of the Sword is a style for assassins. This woman&rsquo;s moves...I cannot believe she is a concubine...I underestimated her.) Like most people, when they first see Lady Ce&rsquo;s demeanor, they assume she is not much of a fighter. Li has a habit of judging others&rsquo; skill and she vastly underestimated Lady Ce.</p>

<p>After exchanging several blows, Celina&rsquo;s movements suddenly became fiercer. Her feet moved faster, causing Vincent to be on guard. &ldquo;Dance of the Sword hidden form: <strong>Dance of the Phoenix!</strong>&rdquo; She used her spinning momentum to increase the power of her attacks, striking the same spot over and over. Vincent blocked by alternative his fans, using one after another. *Clan-clan-clan*</p>

<p>Her strikes were so fast that all he could do was react to them. She changed direction of the spin to prevent getting dizzy. *Clan-clan-clan* Vincent was sweating as he dealt with the immense pressure. This friendly spar as become a fight for survival, at least on his end.</p>

<p>Suddenly, his fan cracked. Both of them stopped moving to see what the other would do. &ldquo;Unbelievable.&rdquo; Vincent exclaimed, staring at his broken fan. &ldquo;You were able to do this much damage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Celina bowed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for breaking your precious weapons. It must be expensive to make them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s fine. You are too polite. These things happen during sparing, you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have been more careful.&rdquo; Celina put her swords back into their shells.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Council covers the cost of these fans. I have backups available in my room, so don&rsquo;t worry about it. But still, what an eye opener that was. The Dance of the Phoenix was pretty impressive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; Celina replied, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am honored to be able to see your final attack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Actually, that was not the final attack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Vincent said, putting his fan over his face. &ldquo;You mean there&rsquo;s another attack even stronger than that? I am good enough to see the final form of the Dance of the Sword.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh I would not put it that way. Maybe one day you will see it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name=&quot;DS_30_B&quot;></a> 30 - B</p>

<p>(So the Dance of the Phoenix isn&rsquo;t even her final move? Tch. She&rsquo;s another person I need to watch out for.)</p>

<p>Li was still standing at the rooftop, staring at the bright blue sky. However, the brightness will soon be covered by a giant shadow and nobody can escape its grasp.</p>

<p>In a town located in Shen, a mansion was burning, and most of the household members were dead. An old man, a servant of the house, crawled backwards. &ldquo;No...don&rsquo;t do this!&rdquo; he pleaded. Li approached him, with a dark look in her eyes, sword in right hand. &ldquo;Why? Why do you do this?&rdquo; Her left leg stepped forward and bent at the knee, and slashed his neck. *Slish* The old man fell down completely, with a blank look on his face.</p>

<p>Li panted for breath. She was ordered to kill an innocent old man and she went through with it. Nay, she murdered the entire family and the servants, even though they were innocent. In the background, the fires burned brightly. She stared at the Black Reaper and many things went through her mind. He slaughtered everyone just to gain a few measly documents...was killing the servants necessary? She is not allowed to question him, for that is the promise she made. And now she may have chosen the wrong person to follow.</p>

<p>The mansion they burned belonged to the Lee family, a prominent family who holds land in the north. With the entire family dead, the land now belongs to the lord whose territory is closest to this town, which is Lord Huong. One of the witnesses survived the slaughter and caught a glimpse of Li&rsquo;s face. The next morning, wanted posters of Li were posted all over the kingdom. This is the reason why there are always assassins after her life and she is always on the run.</p>

<p>That night, Li was unable to sleep, so she snuck out of the building through the window. Celina was also awake and noticed Li&rsquo;s strange behavior.</p>

<p>Li came to the graveyard where three graves were before her - one for Master Genzo, one for Shen Long and one for Sui Long. The night was quiet except for crickets and the occasional hoot from an owl. She stood there gazing at the graves with a blank expression on her face, but of course, on the inside, many emotions are going through her at this moment.</p>

<p>Suddenly, she sensed some movements. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re hiding. Show yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Celina was hiding in a tree from afar. She gasped when Li said those words to her. She was sure to be extra careful and silent with her movements, so how can Li possibly detect her?</p>

<p>Then Vincent revealed himself from behind the trees. Celina sighed in relief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have sharp ears, Li Cheng.&rdquo; said Vincent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmph. I am trained in the art of ninjitsu so I can sense you no matter how sneaky you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not mean to stalk you, Ms. Cheng. I was just checking up on you. &rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, there is no need for your concern.&rdquo; Then Li turned around to face him. &ldquo;Thank you for everything, Vincent. I do not want to lead you astray, or give you false hope. I am not interested in starting a relationship with anyone. I am not looking for friends either. I walk the path of a lone wolf, that is something I decided for myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well then.&rdquo; Vincent walked away with a fan over his face, feeling disappointed.</p>

<p>It was difficult for Li to reject him like that, but it must be done. There is so much she needs to do that she does not need distractions. At this point she had a flash back on the first time she met Vincent Chan.</p>

<p>After traversing the entire width of the forest, Fo Long reached the edge of the hill, where there was a great view of the city below and the sky above. She took off her straw hat and mask, freeing her face so she can feel the breeze against her skin. Her feelings of joy and excitement were indescribable. Years ago, Li would fear going back to the city, but today, she returns with a renewed sense of hope. Staring at the city below, she felt like a monarch about to take over everything, now that she is invincible.</p>

<p>When she left, she was a child fugitive. But now she is an adult, and no one will recognize her, thus the mask is not needed.</p>

<p>The first city on her travel itinerary was Yi Ting, whose magistrate arrested her parents. At night time, there was a horse carriage riding across town, protected by three bodyguards on horses. Li was standing in the middle of the street, clearly in the path of the carriage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said Bodyguard-A.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the hell are you doing, woman?&rdquo; shouted the Bodyguard-B.</p>

<p>Li was not fazed by them at all. &ldquo;I need to see Lord Dumai now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bodyguard-B got off his horse and drew his sword. &ldquo;Move it or we&rsquo;ll move you as a dead body.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Li smiled. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re talking.&rdquo; She drew her sword and charged forward. Bodyguard-B thrust his sword at her, but she dodged, went past his safe zone, and stabbed him. He fell on the ground and bled to death. Bodyguard-A and Bodyguard-C hopped off their horses and attacked her. *Slish Slash* She finished them off with no problems. This helped her confirm that the Heaven&rsquo;s Wrath Style is invincible.</p>

<p><strong>Magistrate Dumai</strong> exited the carriage. &ldquo;What the hell is the ruckus?&rdquo; Then he gasped upon seeing his fallen bodyguards. &ldquo;Aaagh! Who did this? Did you kill them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Li approached Dumai and kicked him in the chest, causing him to fall against the nearby wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugh! Wait, why are you doing this?&rdquo; said the frantic magistrate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Answer my question or this sword will be inside your throat. Ten years ago you arrested a man and woman with the surname Cheng. Where are they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo; said Dumai.</p>

<p>Li&rsquo;s eyes opened wide. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t remember? Don&rsquo;t fuck with me!&rdquo; The tip of the blade touched his cheek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen miss, I don&rsquo;t know who you are. But over the years I have arrested countless people. There&rsquo;s no way I can remember a particular one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have to remember! It was one man and one woman! There&rsquo;s also a small boy with the surname Cheng and he has silver hair! Tell me where that boy is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember. Do you know how many boys with silver hair we have in this big city? And the name Cheng is very common.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Li was extremely pissed off, her blade was shaking from the anger. &ldquo;You...you...!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A man named Vincent just arrived and he rushed over to the scene. He threw a fan at Li. She saw it before it hit her, and knocked it away with her blade, and the fan flew back to Vincent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who the hell are you?&rdquo; Li asked.</p>

<p>Dumai recognized him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Vincent, the swordsman I&rsquo;m supposed to meet tonight! Help me! I&rsquo;ll give you any amount of money you want!&rdquo; He crawled towards Vincent and grabbed his pants. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to die, help me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Li said, &ldquo;Look at his true face, he&rsquo;s just a coward who only cares about his own life. This is the kind of man you&rsquo;re protecting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vincent pushed Dumai off his leg. &ldquo;I already knew the type of man he is. But we of the Heaven&rsquo;s Council do not shed blood needlessly. I was here as a representative to talk to him about the stability of Yi Ting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Li pointed her sword forward. &ldquo;There is no stability with this kind of man running the show! He has done something unforgivable! Don&rsquo;t get in my way!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vincent drew two fans from his sleeves. The ninja girl charged at him and attacked aggressively. Vincent&rsquo;s steel fans to deflected her attacks. *Cling cling* Their range is small, but he had more control over their range of motion, and Li was unable to get close to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grrrrr. What kind of man uses fans? That&rsquo;s a woman&rsquo;s weapon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh? I did not realize fans had a gender assigned to them. What about you? A sword is a man&rsquo;s weapon, yet a woman is holding one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because I want to show the world a woman is as good as any man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vincent threw her fans at her, she blocked, and they would boomerang back to his hands every time. Only able to defend, the ninja girl was getting frustrated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think the same. I want to prove to people that fans are as good as swords.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Li jumped back. &ldquo;This is a waste of time. I&rsquo;m not here to debate with you.&rdquo; She threw smoke bomb on the ground and disappeared.</p>

<p>Vincent and Dumai coughed from the smoke. By the time the smoke cleared, Li was long gone. Vincent had never met a female fighter like that, and he wondered who she was.</p>

<p>After that incident, Magistrate Dumai put up wanted flyers with Li Cheng&rsquo;s face all over the city, as well as neighboring cities. In just one night, Li became a fugitive again.</p>

<p><a name=&quot;DS_30_C&quot;></a> 30 - C</p>

<p>Long ago, Li took a vow that she would only focus on getting stronger and that means removing all unnecessary distractions. The closer you get to someone, the more painful it will be to say goodbye. She learned that lesson from saying goodbye to her friends at the temple. The only thing she cares about is her swordcraft.</p>

<p>Her thoughts were broken when she sensed a threatening presence nearby and she gasped. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The leaves floated up from the wind and the Black Reaper appeared. Celina was surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a while, Li Cheng, or was it Fo Long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you know I was at the Council?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite the veil, his voice was clearly audible. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not hard to track you down...everywhere you go you leave a trail of blood behind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Li drew her Ice Sword.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not seriously going to fight me, are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since I have never seen your face, I have to make sure it&rsquo;s you and not some imposter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you wish.&rdquo; The Reaper drew his blade.</p>

<p>The two smashed their swords into each other and exchanged some moves. Then the two of them clashed their blades in a power lock. Li&rsquo;s blade was glowing white with smoke coming out of it. The Reaper&rsquo;s blade started to become icicles.</p>

<p>Li jumped backwards. &ldquo;It is you after all.&rdquo; She withdrew her Ice Sword.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In our time apart you have acquired the Ice Sword. You have become even more useful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why have you come back after all this time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I need to finish what I started those many years ago. Do you remember your promise, Li?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Li hesitated for a moment as she stared the ground. &ldquo;Yes I remember.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not waste any time. I have a mission for you tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have to go right now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there another place you&rsquo;d rather be?&rdquo; asked the Reaper. &ldquo;I thought you don&rsquo;t belong in a group? Yet here you are, playing a Heaven&rsquo;s Council member? Don&rsquo;t tell me you actually care about these people?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I am just using them for information. I am ready whenever you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Black Reaper turned around, whipping his cape against the wind. Li followed directly behind him. Suddenly, both of them became black blurs and jumped into the trees, vanishing out of sight. Celina took a sigh of relief that she was not discovered.</p>

<p>Li Cheng and the Shadow jumped from rooftop to rooftop as ninjas do. *doosh doosh* &ldquo;Where are you taking me?&rdquo; Li asked. &ldquo;Since I&rsquo;m on this mission I have a right to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are going to the Chung household.&rdquo; said the Shadow. &ldquo;They have a certain map that I want. The map contains the location of a cave that holds the secret to the Shadow Style.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The secret to the Shadow Style?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the middle of their running, Li has a flashback from a few years ago, a time before Duke Xiang&rsquo;s rebellion. The Shadow was sitting on a table, examining some documents he stole. Li poured him some tea. &ldquo;What is it that you&rsquo;re looking for? Oh wait, I&rsquo;m not supposed to ask, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; replied the Shadow. &ldquo;Now is the right time to tell you about the Shadow Style.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Shadow Style?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the style that I use and also the style that I am teaching you. Did you know that the Shadow Style was founded by a man that was half-demon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Half demon?&rdquo; she repeated dumbly. &ldquo;Is such an existence possible?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This half demon was the natural born child of a demon father and a human mother.&rdquo; said the Black Reaper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh? Demons and humans can make a child? I never thought such a thing was possible!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one thought it was possible, until the half-demon was born. But demons are the enemy of mankind and his existence is an abomination. He was shunned by society, hunted down no matter where he went. So he developed the Shadow Style so he could defend himself. But he refined into an assassin&rsquo;s style.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this is the same style that you use, master?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I use the Shadow Style but what I know about it is incomplete. This half-demon has written down his knowledge in some cave in this kingdom. And the location of this cave is written on a map, which is in the hands of a lord or magistrate. I don&rsquo;t know which one has it, so we are going to narrow down the list. It may be a long shot but it is the only clue we have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<strong>Lord Chung</strong>, your tea is ready.&rdquo; the servant announced as he brought the tray onto the table. He began to pour the tea into the cups.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about time, servant. We are dying of thirst over here.&rdquo; said Chung. He was sitting down next to two women, one on his left and one on his right.</p>

<p> One woman was fanning him. &ldquo;Make sure you stay cool, my lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other woman fed him a grape. &ldquo;Have some tasty grapes, my lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He opened his mouth so she could insert the grape into his mouth. &ldquo;Mmmm, delicious. Ahh, this is the life. Living in my own mansion, surrounded by beautiful women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two women giggled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who needs the imperial palace when I have everything I need right here? To stay in the safety of my own territory is the more logical choice, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the servant bowing. &ldquo;You are very wise, my lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The king and other lords keep asking me to go to the palace to have meetings with them. Who wants to discuss politics with crusty old men? It&rsquo;s so boring. And don&rsquo;t forget, my relative <strong>General Chung</strong> who was killed during a rebellion. The palace is too dangerous and everyone is out to get you so there is no reason for me to be there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The servant said, &ldquo;Yes, my lord. That is an outrage that we cannot forget.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lord Tsuma Chung is one of the high lords of the Shen Kingdom. Due to the amount of territories and armies he holds, his power is comparable to that of Lords Huong, Fei, Sima and Yu. Unlike the others, he takes no interest in politics and has been ignoring summons to the palace all this time. But because of his status, no one was able to do a thing to him.</p>

<p>*Doosh doosh* Li and the Black Reaper arrived after dashing through rooftops. &ldquo;We are here, at Lord Chung&rsquo;s mansion.&rdquo; said the Shadow. &ldquo;Somewhere inside is the map to the cave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Li silently stared at the contents of the mansion. Last time she infiltrated a mansion, many lives were lost, and she wondered if history will repeat itself. Her fists clenched tightly.</p>

<p> <hr /> <p><a name=&quot;DS_31_A&quot;></a>&#19977;&#21313;&#19968;: Secret of the Map. Can Li Cheng Be Trusted?</p>

<p> <p>The female ninja and the Shadow&rsquo;s plan to infiltrate the mansion was simple &ndash; the Shadow will distract the bodyguards while Li sneaks into the treasure room unnoticed. Li was wearing a black face mask. They separate, running in opposite directions. The Shadow ran along the top of the wall and immediately a bodyguard noticed him. He blew his whistle and everyone heard it and lit up their lanterns.</p>

<p>The Shadow landed on the ground and charged at the bodyguard with the whistle and they clashed blades. *Clang* The Shadow pushed the man&rsquo;s blade up, leaving his torso open and he slashed the man&rsquo;s stomach, causing blood to squirt out of his wound and he fell down.</p>

<p>The head bodyguard along with five other bodyguards arrived. The Reaper did not seem concerned. &ldquo;Is that all of you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; asked the head bodyguard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am just a shadow but there is no point in telling my name to those who are about to die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The head bodyguard grunted and then yelled: &ldquo;Get him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The body guards drew their swords and charged at their target. *Clang* *Slash* The Reaper killed one of them. *Slash* He killed another one of them.</p>

<p>The Reaper hopped into the air and started spinning as he glided diagonally, causing his blade to spin, becoming a human needle. He stabbed a third bodyguard while landing. The head bodyguard was in awe by this mystery man&rsquo;s skills.</p>

<p>A fourth bodyguard attacked and the Reaper blocked his strike. A bodyguard from behind slashed and cut the Reaper&rsquo;s cape. The Reaper unhooked his cape and it let fly into the rear bodyguard&rsquo;s line of sight, getting caught in his sword. Then the Reaper <strong>blurred</strong> and appeared behind the front bodyguard...and the bodyguard&rsquo;s blade broke and he fell down.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, besides the head bodyguard, only one remained. The lone swordsman took a step back and started to sweat. The Reaper dashed forward and attacked and he blocked. *Cling* The Reaper made a follow up strike and hit the swordsman in the chest, killing him before he hit the ground.</p>

<p>The head bodyguard started to panic. &ldquo;No way...&rdquo; He turned around and ran away.</p>

<p>The Reaper tilted his arm back and threw the sword forward. *Whoosh* It went into the head bodyguard&rsquo;s back and he fell down with blood dripping over his clothes.</p>

<p>*Dash dash* The female ninja reached the building&rsquo;s window with impeccable footwork. She pushed the window open and hopped inside. In one second she quickly scanned the entire room and saw a safe. She bent down and cut the lock open with a pocket knife and stuck her hand inside. She found a scroll and opened and revealed a map. She folded the scroll back up and stuck it inside her shirt.</p>

<p>Just now the door opened and Li turned around to see Lord Chung with a surprised look on his face. It took only a quick second to understand what was going on. Li&rsquo;s right hand reached for the pommel of her sword and Chung ran forward. As she drew the blade out Chung pushed her hand which pushed the blade back into its sheath.</p>

<p>Li threw palm strikes at him and he blocked while returning some strikes of his own. At this close distance she was unable to draw her sword. *thud thud*</p>

<p> <p>they throw their palms at each other&rsquo;s palm, they hit some more.</p>

<p>li hits him with the phoenix palm in the shoulder</p>

<p>She jumps out the window and escapes.</p>

<p> <p>Li Cheng and the Shadow met up at an arbitrary rooftop. &ldquo;Do you have it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s right here.&rdquo; Li replied, pointing at her scroll.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excellent. You hold onto it. Return to the Council and when the time is right, we will go to the cave. I will come and get you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Li nodded, and the two became blurs and vanished out of sight. As instructed, Li returned to the Council, hoping to sneak in as if nothing happened. Because the Heaven&rsquo;s Council is just a building with meeting rooms, the members sleep in hotel rooms near the meeting rooms. Li&rsquo;s hotel room happens to be next to Celina&rsquo;s room.</p>

<p>When Li returned to her room, she was tired from all those activities. She put the scroll and her belongings on the table. Then she walked over to the bathroom and placed her sword on the floor, directly next to the bathtub. She unzipped her black suit. *Zwip* She let it drop on the floor and then removed her pants. Once she removed all her clothes, she hopped into the <strong>bathtub</strong> and began to wash herself. *Splash*</p>

<p>The door to her room opened and Celina snuck in quietly. *Creeek* She crouched and walked on the balls of her feet to reduce the noise of her steps to a minimum. From the screen, she could see Li&rsquo;s silhouette washing her arm. Celina made her way to the table and opened the scroll, which revealed a map. Her eyes darted left and right to memorize the contents of the map. She glanced to the left to look at Li&rsquo;s silhouette just to make sure, and then she continued to stare at the map. When she was done, she snuck out of the room as quietly as she came in.</p>

<p>As soon as Celina returned to her room, she took out a blank piece of paper and redrew the map she saw moments ago.</p>

<p><a name=&quot;DS_31_B&quot;></a>[ B ]</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks like a treasure map. Is this Li&rsquo;s copy of the map?&rdquo; Xiao asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Celina. &ldquo;This is my copy that I redrew from memory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From memory? You can drew a whole map even though you stared at it for a few seconds? That&rsquo;s impressive!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well...&rdquo; Celina replied bashfully, &ldquo;When I was a concubine, I spent a lot of time in the library. And I looked at a lot of maps because I was interested in the geography of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ehh? But still, you have a keen talent for memorization. I bet you use this talent to memorize dance routines, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmmm. I&rsquo;ve actually never thought about that. I&rsquo;ve always thought my memory is the same as everyone else&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see. The map may lead to something else other than treasure. The location is a cave located at the end of a river. It is north of the city next to our city. I wonder where Li got this map from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Celina replied. &ldquo;But I saw her sneaking out somewhere with the Black Shadow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re telling the truth. Li&rsquo;s activity is definitely suspicious. Have you brought this up to Alex yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. He believes in his sister, so I thought I&rsquo;d tell you first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good point. But we should tell him anyways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moments later, Alex was in the same room as Celina and Xiao, and they presented the map to him. Celina also explained what she saw in the cemetery. After examining the map, Alex put it back on the table and walked over to the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know this is hard to accept.&rdquo; said Celina. &ldquo;But this is the map I found in her room. I don&rsquo;t know what her relationship to the Shadow is, but I saw them leave together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can confirm she is telling the truth.&rdquo; Xiao added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This map doesn&rsquo;t prove anything.&rdquo; Alex said without turning around. &ldquo;Even if she went with the Shadow, I&rsquo;m sure she has her reasons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What reason does she have for allying with our enemy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe he is blackmailing her?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Li always does things for a reason. But she is not our enemy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Xiao stood up. &ldquo;Alex, the Shadow has attacked the Council and killed several members. He is our enemy but I am not sure why Li is involved in all this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Li is a shady character. She is always keeping secrets from us. For example, she knew Vincent as a contact from the Council and she withheld that information from us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if so, Li must have a reason for it! She&rsquo;s lived a hard life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Celina stood up. &ldquo;But Alex-&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard enough. Let&rsquo;s stop this.&rdquo; Alex was visibly upset and he left the room, shutting the door behind him.</p>

<p>Xiao sighed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as you predicted, Alex is completely blinded by his own emotions. It looks like we have one option left. I can use my mind&rsquo;s eye so we can get the truth from Li herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The servant came into the living room. &ldquo;My lord, Sir Ragnarok is here to see you.&rdquo; He bowed and opened the door, letting Ragnarok walk inside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have a seat.&rdquo; said Tsuma Chung.</p>

<p> Ragnarok sat down and the servant proceeded to pour tea for both of them. &ldquo;I am here to speak on behalf of my master, Lord Zhang, the true king. But right now he is treated as a fugitive so he cannot make it personally, so hopefully you understand his predicament.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. I heard about what happened from my friends at the palace. I too support Lord Zhang as the true King of Shen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ragnarok took a sip of tea. &ldquo;That is most excellent. Now, let&rsquo;s get to the matter at hand. I believe you have a certain map that is of interest to my master.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lord Chung took a scroll and placed it on the table. &ldquo;This is what you are looking for. The map leads to a secret tunnel that leads to a cave. The cave has the secrets of the Shadow Style, a sword style that no one has ever seen before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my master would most certainly be interested.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The location of the cave is a secret that my father passed down to me. But I am not a swordsman so these secrets are of no use to me. I have no problem giving it to you. However, in return...will Lord Zhang give me what is <strong>promised</strong> to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, my master always keeps his word. You give us the map and he will give you immortality.&rdquo; said Ragnarok.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is most excellent. We will get along, I can tell.&rdquo; Lord Chung handed him the map. &ldquo;I have one more question for you. Are you really Chu Yen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chu Yen is a name of the past. Ragnarok is name of the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As one of the Four Brothers, Chu Yen should be over seventy years old today. But you look not a day older than twenty years old.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A smile came across Ragnarok&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;That is one of the benefits of being immortal - you get to stay young forever. I am living proof of my master&rsquo;s words. Help us in our cause and you will be receive immortality, that I promise you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shortly after Alex left the room, Li entered the room. Xiao thought it was better than having to look for her. &ldquo;Li?&rdquo; said Celina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what you did, Miss Concubine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite follow you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you took a look at my map. I&rsquo;m a ninja and I can sense when you come into my room. Even when I&rsquo;m bathing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Celina stood up. &ldquo;No wait-&rdquo;</p>

<p>Li slammed her palm on the table. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you stole from me but if you don&rsquo;t trust me that&rsquo;s fine by me. We are not a team.&rdquo; She exited the room.</p>

<p>Xiao and Celina went after her and their conversation continued in the hallway. &ldquo;Wait, Li! Alex believes in you but I am not Alex. I have my doubts about you and it would be nice if you explained yourself. What were you doing with the Black Reaper?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Li turned around. &ldquo;How did you know about that? Tch. Looks like I&rsquo;m not the only stealthy one around here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why were you with someone as dangerous as the Reaper?&rdquo; asked Celina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s none of your business!&rdquo; Li snapped at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lady Ce is telling the truth.&rdquo; said Xiao. &ldquo;Li, you&rsquo;re a member of the Council just like us so we need to be transparent with each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugh, not you too Xiao. Are you taking Miss Concubine&rsquo;s side?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Xiao took a step forward. &ldquo;Remember the time we went to the Temple and the forest after that? I saw a side of you I never saw before. Please, Li, I want to believe in you. But you have to tell me the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Li glanced to the side. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try your mind&rsquo;s eye on me. Here&rsquo;s a word of advice. Stop spying on people. And don&rsquo;t go near the Reaper because you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re dealing with.&rdquo; Li walked away.</p>
