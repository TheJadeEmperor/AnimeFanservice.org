<p> <hr /> <p><strong>The Night of the Red Feather Rebellion</strong></p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;RedFeatherRebellion&quot;></a>Red Feather Rebellion</p></p>

<p> <p><a name=&quot;Night_of_Passion&quot;></a>Night of Passion</p></p>

<p><p>Alex was sitting by his window in solitude, staring at the evening sky. Celina came into the room and wanted to say something, but she did not know what to say. &ldquo;Alex&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It was reckless of me to accept the duel under those terms. I am sorry I did not tell you sooner. It&rsquo;s because&#8230;I was embarrassed. I was thinking what&rsquo;d happen if I lose, and I could not face you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Alex&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The person I am going to duel&#8230;Khan&#8230;I have seen his sword craft. He is not to be underestimated. It will not be an easy fight.&rdquo; Alex stood up and handed her the Fire Sword. &ldquo;Celina, should anything happen to me&#8230;I want you to have this. This Fire Sword is what my late master left me. It is the remnant of the God of War.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she said, pushing it back to him. &ldquo;You need this for the duel.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What good is this Fire Sword if it falls to enemy hands? I have not been able to give you anything, so please, take it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, I cannot. The God of War gave it to you. <strong>You</strong> are his student, not me.&rdquo; She touched him on the shoulder. &ldquo;It will not fall into enemy hand&rsquo;s because you will not lose.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>But Alex was still not convinced. &ldquo;I have to go.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wait&#8230;where are you going?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I have to train more.&rdquo; Alex replied.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You need to be well rested for tomorrow. Training now will not make a difference. You will not improve overnight.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Even if so, how can I fall asleep tonight?&rdquo; He continued to walk.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; She embraced him from behind, her hands clutching his shirt tightly.</p></p>

<p><p>Alex was dumbfounded. &ldquo;Celina&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go&#8230;This could be our last night together. Stay with me for the night, please.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Her love for him is stronger than he originally thought. He was too in his head to notice that she&rsquo;s always been there for him, during the good times and bad. Especially the bad. &ldquo;No! Stop saying that. I think you&rsquo;re a great swordsman.&rdquo; &ldquo;For someone who works as hard as you, you can&rsquo;t be worthless. Not in my eyes.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what she said when his spirits were down.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, he felt selfish for thinking about leaving her when she needs him the most. Her embrace was strong despite her having frail, skinny arms. She will not let go no matter what. Even if he wanted to move, he couldn&rsquo;t. He was still worried about the duel, but the least he can do is spend one more night with her.</p></p>

<p><p>Alex was sitting on the window again. This is his usual spot to sit when he is bored or wants to spend time alone. He spends much time daydreaming and looking at the scenery. He has sat here countless times to think about his missing sister. And in this moment, he is thinking about the duel tomorrow.</p></p>

<p><p>Celina came in holding a tray with a teapot. &ldquo;The tea is ready.&rdquo; She put the tray on the table. Alex heard her voice but did not bother to respond. She glanced at him, and his attention was at the sky instead of her, which bothered her.</p></p>

<p><p>Without uttering another sound, she began to unzip the back of her qipao. Zzzzpppp. She pulled the shoulders area down and released her arms from the sleeves. She pulled the cloth down to her waist and let the dress slide off her legs. *Plop* Underneath she was wearing a red undergarment in the shape of an apron. The bottom barely covered her waist, revealing most of her legs. The top was of a trapezoid shape with strings that go around the neck. Most of her back was exposed, the garment around her waist has a ribbon on it. Celina reached around her neck and untied the string, releasing the top part, and let the garment fall on top of her dress. *Plop*</p></p>

<p><p>Alex heard a ruffling noise and looked at her, and his expression was one of shock. He could not believe he was staring at her naked body.</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;C-Celina, what are you doing?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She just stared at him without saying a word. Today she had a different look in her eyes. She has the eyes of someone who loves and cares, and her eyes were inviting him to touch her. Considering how innocent and reserved she is, it is shocking that she just stripped naked in front of him.</p></p>

<p><p>Alex approached her and she stared at him, her heart pounding and her breathing nearly stopped. Considering she has done this before, he should not be surprised, right? He panicked and snatched a white blanket from the bed and covered her front. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll catch a cold.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The look on her eyes turned to one of sadness and a hint of anger. How could he say that after she summoned so much courage to show him her naked form? &ldquo;You&#8230;you don&rsquo;t want me anymore!&rdquo; Tears appeared in her eyes and she turned around to walk away.</p></p>

<p><p>Alex just realized what a stupid thing he&rsquo;s done. &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he exclaimed, grabbing her wrist. He pulled her into him and they both stared at each other&rsquo;s eyes silently. Both their eyes were shaking, especially Celina&rsquo;s. Alex leaned in and kissed her on the lips, his hand squeezing her wrist tight. Her eyes slowly closed, still full of tears from seconds ago. During the kiss, his other hand snatched her other wrist and the blanket fell to the floor. This time, it made no sound, at least no sound that this couple can hear, for they were enjoying the kiss to notice anything else. He kept leaning into her more, causing her to lean back, her head tilting at an angle. This is Alex&rsquo;s answer...this is <strong>the </strong>only right answer to her.</p></p>

<p><p>Before they knew it, they were both naked on the bed. Celina was lying down, her head placed on a pillow, with Alex on top of her, both tucked under the blanket. Alex&rsquo;s head was on her breasts, so his entire body was hidden under the blanket. Whatever he was doing caused Celina to moan and her head turned left and right. Her eyes were shut but her eyelids twitched a lot, her eyebrows slanted, and her forehead full of sweat.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, she had a flashback of a repressed memory...a nightmare that she wanted to forget no matter what.</p></p>

<p><p>Jiax grabbed her by the hands and they struggled, and he pushed her down until he was completely on top of her. Even though she knew it would be useless, she still had to struggle, for what else is she supposed to do? Just let him take advantage of her as he pleases?</p></p>

<p><p>Her never ending torture continues as he put his face between her breasts. They felt like pork buns. By now, he&rsquo;s already familiar with her body. He knew every bit of it in detail. As he shoved his face between her breasts and kissed them all over, it was a good and familiar feeling. Poor Celina was forced to wear nothing but ribbons this entire time she was captured, and it&rsquo;s the way Jiax likes it. During this time, he has learned many things about her, particularly her physique. He knows details that no man in Shen is supposed to know.</p></p>

<p><p>Every inch of her arm he has touched, every part of her neck and her neckline has kissed with his lips and caressed with his face. He has touched her breasts over and over, and he knows their size and contents.</p></p>

<p><p>Celina&rsquo;s most sacred secrets are exposed to this vulgar brute. Celina&rsquo;s life is already over but her humiliation continues.</p></p>

<p><p>He kissed her chin and her neck, she turned her head to the side while shedding tears. Jiax grabbed her chin, making her face him. She just stared at him with wet, dripping eyes. He kissed her lips. Jiax believes that he owns her entirely. Every part of her body belongs to him and he can do what he pleases.</p></p>

<p><p>He lifts up her leg and admires it from top to bottom. He ran his hand along its contents as if it were a work of art. He kissed her ankles all over, then her lower thigh, and her knee and upper thigh. Celina moaned in pain.</p></p>

<p><p>Celina&rsquo;s arms left the blanket and moved upwards to the pillow to squeeze it. She continued to squirm and squeeze the pillow.</p></p>

<p><p>Inside the blanket, Alex was tasting her <strong>breasts</strong> fully with his mouth. They felt so soft and firm like meat buns. Her breasts tasted sweet...they were a hundred times sweeter than the best dessert he&rsquo;s ever had. The best part was the valley between the breasts...he could fit his mouth and entire nose inside.</p></p>

<p><p>He moved his lips to her cleavage, kissing every part to make sure he doesn&rsquo;t miss an inch. Her cleavage tastes slightly different than the top of her breasts, but it was equally as enjoyable.</p></p>

<p><p>He glided his lips to her sternum, it tasted smooth and creamy, while his nose brushed her neck. Then he glided his lips to her neck and kissed the front of it, then the side of her neck. Every inch of her body tastes good and smells good, yet each part tastes different. Her body was like an all you can eat buffet, and he was excited to see what each part will taste like.</p></p>

<p><p>After he was done with her neck, he lifted his head up to look at her face. Her eyes were shut and her lips quivered. Because her eyes were twitching he could see the wrinkles above her eyebrows. Her head was tilted slightly to the right. Alex thought it was unusual because she seemed to be in pain instead of enjoying it. Then his expression changed when figured out something.</p></p>

<p><p>At one time, Celina was a political hostage and she was defiled by bandits. She is still traumatized by the horrible things that happened to her. That is why her face was trembling...her body was also trembling. Even though she&rsquo;s afraid, she still wants to do this? Alex felt selfish...she was doing her best despite her fear, while he was enjoying the buffet. But is there anything he can do for her? The answer is <strong>not</strong> to stop...or she will act like she did earlier, with sadness and disappointment.</p></p>

<p><p>Alex leaned closed to her face and his nose brushed her nose as he moved his lips to her forehead and kissed it. Her forehead tasted different than other body parts. He glided his lips to her nose and kissed it. &ldquo;Celina, I love you.&rdquo; he whispered. He could tell she reacted positively to his words, as her eyes twitched less and her lips stopped quivering. Then he planted his lips into her <strong>lips</strong>, kissing and swallowing them wholly. This kiss was more aggressive than all the other times he kissed her...he wanted to express his feelings and go all out, to make sure she receives those feelings. Celina is the only person who truly knows who he is. Without her, his life is not complete, and she is not complete without him.</p></p>

<p><p>Her lips were the sweetest part of her entire body. They taste so soft, wet, and juicy, it was juicier than a watermelon and sweeter than a plum. He intended to make this kiss as long as humanly possible. His hands gradually moved up and held her arms. They instinctively ran along the contents of her arm, reaching her forearm, and stopping at the wrists.</p></p>

<p><p>Alex kept twisting his head at different angles to keep the intensity of the kiss going. His fingers released her wrists and glided up to her palms, resulting in their <strong>fingers interlocking</strong>. Somehow, this felt right, as if their fingers were meant to interlock. This is how he will help her forget the nightmares.</p></p>

<p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Alex had to breathe so he released the kiss, and they both panted for breath. They could feel each other&rsquo;s breath and it tingled. There was only one thing left to do...this next move will surely make her forget the nightmares.</p></p>

<p><p>Alex stroked her and Celina groaned with her head tilted upwards. &ldquo;Uuuuuuh!&rdquo; Their bodies were concealed by the blanket, but one can see their hip movements, even if it is but a vague outline.</p></p>

<p><p>He stroked her again, causing her to scream, while her head tossed and turned. Her fingers squeezed the pillow tighter. Out of all the things he has done to her, this has caused the biggest reaction. This also felt right...Alex found himself unable to stop, not that he wanted to. This bond they have will make her forget her nightmares because no man can do this for her...no man but him. This is something only he can do!</p></p>

<p><p>She screamed from each stroke. &ldquo;Uuuuuuaaaaah! Uuuuuuuuh! Uuuuuuh!&rdquo; Their feet were seen outside the blanket and Celina&rsquo;s feet brushed the bed sheet as she bent her legs. Her fingers squeezed the pillow as tight as humanly possible.</p></p>

<p><p>The sensation they felt is just like a <strong>volcano</strong> with boiling lava ready to explode at any moment. Each stroke is like bubbles popping in the lava. Each stroke brings the volcano closer to its eventual eruption.</p></p>

<p><p>Alex has no intention of stopping, no matter how tired he was. The sensation down there was indescribable...and he felt tingles throughout his body. He continued stroking her, taking only a one second break between each stroke.</p></p>

<p><p>The lava&rsquo;s <strong>bubbles</strong> continue to pop, causing the entire mountain to shudder.</p></p>

<p><p>She screamed with her head tilted up. &ldquo;UUUUUH! UUUUUH!&rdquo; The sweat drops on her head flew to the air and sparkled. At this point, Celina was unable to think about the nightmares, she was unable to think about anything. All she can do was act on her primal instincts.</p></p>

<p><p>As he became more turned on, he stroked harder and faster, which made him more turned on. Just like Celina, his eyes were shut as he felt the sensations.</p></p>

<p><p>His chest was leaning on her breasts and he could feel their softness as they bounced against his skin. His face was a few inches away from her face, but their breathing was so hard they could smell each other&rsquo;s breaths.</p></p>

<p><p>Dozens of <strong>bubbles</strong> of popped at the same time, causing the lava to become unstable.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;UUUUUH! UUUUUH!&rdquo; She kept bending her legs and kicking them randomly that she brushed the blanket upwards. More of their legs were exposed to the air.</p></p>

<p><p>Now the two have become one in body and mind. They both felt the exact sensations in the same places...except that whatever pain and pleasure Alex felt, she felt it one hundred times more. A woman&rsquo;s body is more sensitive than a man&rsquo;s, that is why that they can moan and scream they way they do.</p></p>

<p><p>He can feel her body ready to explode...the volcano is almost at the breaking point. Her fingers squeezed the pillow, nearly ripping it apart. Her legs keep bending up and down, and her feet kicked his feet. In the lava, hundreds of <strong>bubbles</strong> popped at the same time. Her facial expression also showed she was close to the breaking point. By now, her chin was facing the air, her head completely upside down. Her neck could not bend any further. The bubbles became bigger and more violent...the lava was reaching its limit. Her screams grew louder and more painful by the second...all signs point to the point of no return.</p></p>

<p><p>And then, after several strokes, it finally happened. Celina screamed at the top of her lungs. &ldquo;UUUUUAAAAAAAAAAH!&rdquo; The volcano erupted. <strong>*Kaboom*</strong> The red lava flew high up and splattered everywhere, spilling over the volcano&rsquo;s mouth.</p></p>

<p><p> But Alex did not stop there, as a volcano requires a lot of energy to erupt. He kept stroking her with the same intensity as she screamed for her life. Finally, after using up all that energy, Alex fell on top of her, his face resting on her cheek. Celina&rsquo;s fingers released the pillow a little bit and her arms relaxed. Her legs relaxed and her feet did not kick as hard. She could feel his breathing and it was becoming regular again.</p></p>

<p><p>But it was not over yet, for he wanted to keep the momentum going. Alex smothered her with kisses on her neck, jaw line, and cheek. Occasionally he&rsquo;d taste her sweat but it tasted good. He then kissed the front of her neck while his nose hit her chin. Even after the explosion, he continued his assault with no mercy.</p></p>

<p><p>He began to stroke her again, although not as hard. Her arm and fingers tensed up again. &ldquo;Uuuuh! Uuuuh!&rdquo; Her groans and screams have returned.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, he planted his lips on top of hers and continued to stroke her. Her screams became muffled moans. &ldquo;MMMFFF! MMFFF!&rdquo; She did not expect this, but she did not resist. &ldquo;MMMFFF! MMFFF!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The candles eventually burned themselves out, but they were still making love behind the curtains, for it could be their last night together.</p></p>

<p><p>Before they knew it, the night had passed. Alex woke up next to Celina, who was still sleeping. They were both naked, tucked under the blanket. Their clothes lay scattered all over the floor. Alex stood up and put on his pants.</p></p>

<p><p>(Sorry, Celina. But I have to go to my duel. I wish we had more time&#8230;)</p></p>

<p><p>When he got fully dressed, he left the room. The hour of the duel is almost near. Cheng looked up at the sky. If he fails, then that is where he will end up &ndash; in the heavens. The duel today will make him or break him. Will the hero make overcome his toughest obstacle yet?</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;Attack_while_sleep_1&quot;></a>Attakced While Sleeping 1</p></p>

<p><p>The woman was lying sideways in bed, covered by nothing but a white blanket. Celina was sleeping but wincing and moaning painfully. Drops of sweat dripped down her face as she was struggling. She was having a nightmare about something that happened a short while ago, a certain something that she could never forget, no matter how hard she tried to repress the memory.</p></p>

<p><p>The kidnappers laughed maliciously as they watched their victim whimpering and squirming in fear. Without knowing why, Celina became the hostage of these bandits, and she was bound to a chair, surrounded and scared for her life. Her arms were behind the chair, her wrists tied up tightly by rope. Her ankles were tied together and bound to the chair&rsquo;s legs. Her mouth was gagged by a white cloth, thus she was unable to utter a word. All she could do was moan and make noises and watched in fear as these men decided her fate.</p></p>

<p><p>The one in charge was Lord Huong, one of the elder high lords. &ldquo;Now that we have the king&rsquo;s favorite concubine captive, King Liu Bei is now under the duke&rsquo;s control.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We should throw her in the dungeon.&rdquo; Said a bandit.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, let&rsquo;s keep her here where we can watch her.&rdquo; said Jiax, the boss of these bandits. &ldquo;What should we do with her?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The duke&rsquo;s orders are to keep her alive.&rdquo; said Lord Huong. &ldquo;As long as she remains alive, you can do anything you please.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A wicked smile came over Jiax&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Anything, you say?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Anything. The duke does not care.&rdquo; With that said, Huong left the room.</p></p>

<p><p>Then Jiax gazed at the tied up woman and grinned. All the bandits had the same grin on their faces.</p></p>

<p><p>Their stares made her feel very uncomfortable. Wearing a thin white qipao and unable to move, she felt vulnerable. There were four bandits here and by the looks on their faces, they had only one thing on their minds. Celina feared for her life and she was on the verge of tears. She wanted to beg for mercy but could not say any words with this cloth stuck in her mouth.</p></p>

<p><p>These men were bandits, made up of rapists and murderers, the lowest of criminals. And judging by the greedy, perverted looks in their eyes, Celina knew what they were thinking. She struggled and squirmed in the chair, making moaning noises, pleading them not to come closer. Tears of fear appeared in the corner of her eyes.</p></p>

<p><p> Jiax took out a knife from his pocket. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s about we treat our guest with some hospitality.&rdquo; He pointed the blade at her cheek.</p></p>

<p><p>She moaned. &ldquo;Mmfff!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What would happen if I cut your pretty face?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Her eyes were shaking as they stared at the knife&rsquo;s blade, and she winced, turning to the side.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmmm. Which side of your face should I cut first? This side?&rdquo; he said tauntingly. Then he moved the knife to her other cheek. &ldquo;Or this side?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Celina turned her head the other way. &ldquo;Mmff! Mmff!&rdquo; Tears drip down her cheek and fell on the blade.</p></p>

<p><p>A bandit grabbed her hair from behind and titled her head up. &ldquo;Mmff!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon boss, let&rsquo;s just strip her naked and have our way with her!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Patience.&rdquo; Jiax replied. &ldquo;We are going to take it slowly&#8230;that is the more enjoyable way.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The bandit let go of hair. Jiax enjoyed the look on the frightened woman&rsquo;s face, the look of fear and helplessness. This is one of the best parts of torturing women, their screams and moans and the look on their face as they are about to be devoured. He pointed the knife at her chin, then glided it down her neck. She panted for breath, waiting in suspense. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;re going to take her piece by piece&#8230;&rdquo; He slowly glided the knife down her sternum, making a vertical cut on her dress.</p></p>

<p><p>Celina&rsquo;s eyes twitched and she moaned and squirmed. The pain that she felt on her body that day was still evident, as she was feeling it right now.</p></p>

<p><p>The bandits laughed and cheered as Jiax continued to cut various parts of her dress. *Slish* He made a vertical down on her neckline, revealing some cleavage on her breasts. &ldquo;MMMMFFF!&rdquo; she moaned. The bandits stared with glittering, greedy eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>Jiax pointed the knife at the incision of her dress, where her thigh was. He cut along the incision, revealing more of her thighs. &ldquo;Mmfff!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The bandits made remarks as they grew more excited. &ldquo;Wooh yeah! I want to see more!&rdquo; &ldquo;Let the strip show begin!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> Jiax then cut the dress at her stomach. *Slish* He made several more cuts at the abdomen area. *Slish slish* Celina moaned each time he cut something. &ldquo;Mmfff! Mmfff Mmfff!&rdquo; All she could do was make noises and shed tears as the bandits stripped her clothes and her dignity. Each cut he made was one step closer to her being exposed completely, which for a shy and gentle girl like her, would be unthinkable.</p></p>

<p><p>A bandit came up from behind her and pulled on her pony tail, yanking it back and forth. As he was yanking her, Jiax continued to cut her dress off piece by piece. Jiax cut off the top parts, revealing more of her cleavage. &ldquo;Mmfff! Mmmfff!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Then he pointed the blade at her shoulder while she stared and pleaded him not to do it. Her head turned left and right and she moaned desperately. &ldquo;Nnnfff! Nnnfff!&rdquo; He cut pieces of the dress&rsquo;s shoulder, revealing more of her skin. <strong>*Slish*</strong> Pieces of white fabric floated to the air.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Nnnnnffff!&rdquo; Celina&rsquo;s eyes were full of fear and despair. More tears drip down as her entire shoulder was exposed.</p></p>

<p><p>The bandit from behind put his cheek next to hers. &ldquo;I wonder how she tastes.&rdquo; He licked her exposed shoulder with his tongue. *Scccccchhhhhlerp* She moaned and turned to the side. He started with the outside of her shoulder and glided his tongue towards the top. His tongue was wet and disgusting. She prayed for an escape from this situation from hell, not wanting to be licked by this bandit. He grabbed her hair and pulled her head back while his tongue licked her neck. &ldquo;Nnnnnfff!&rdquo; She winced, shutting her eyes.</p></p>

<p><p> Then he licked her jaw. Then he licked her cheek, including the cloth in her mouth. One could tell she was desperate by her expression, her eyes were twitching in their eyelids, her eyebrows were furrowed. Her head was turned completely away from him and yet she tried to turn more, beyond the limits of her neck. Her arms thrashed about trying to get her wrists free. Her legs instinctively closed themselves, her knees touching.</p></p>

<p><p>A tear drop fell down her cheek. He licked the tear drop, gliding his tongue upwards, and it nearly touched her eye. &ldquo;Nnnnnnn...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p> <p>It was truly a nightmare come true for Celina, having her dress cut to pieces, while these perverts glared at her, all waiting to see her flesh.</p></p>

<p><p>And she was bound to the chair, her wrists tied behind her back and her ankles were tied up, just sitting there like a helpless puppet. This has the ultimate humiliation for a woman, to lose everything that is important to her to a group of rapists.</p></p>

<p><p>While she was sleeping defenselessly, a man came into her room. His shadow slowly approached the bed. It was easier to get in than he thought, for there was no one guarding the building. What luck it is indeed for him, it will make his job much easier.</p></p>

<p><p>Jiax had a wicked smile on his lips as he approached the bed, where Celina was resting like an angel. An angel about to have her wings cut off. Jiax came to the bed and took a good look at her frail, weak body. He smiled as he looked at her cleavage, and God knows what he was thinking in that dark mind of his.</p></p>

<p><p>How defenseless she was, just laying there naked, not having any idea what was about to fall upon her. How convenient for him that she is unconscious, it will be an easy job for him. How unfortunate for her to be in this situation, as she had let her guard down completely. Jiax had no trouble getting in and there was no one to protect her.</p></p>

<p><p>He could do all sorts of things to her, and she would not be able to do a thing about it. When she wakes up, it will already be too late.</p></p>

<p><p>He kept on tapping the knife against her face. &ldquo;I should just cut you up right now.&rdquo; he said, and smiled wickedly. He put the tip of the blade on her forehead, and tantalizingly moved the blade down to her nose.</p></p>

<p><p>Celina breathed hard and shut her eyes, dreading each and every second. Every second feels like an eternity and she just wished it would be over. He moved the blade to her lips and let it stay there for while.</p></p>

<p><p>Then he guided the knife down to her chin and poked it several times. Celina moaned and shed tears. Her wrists were tied up to the bed, and she can do nothing to defend herself.</p></p>

<p><p>Jiax moved the knife down to the area between her breasts and he poked them. He found it a turn on to touch her body with the knife. For some reason, this is a thrill to him, a sick hobby that he can indulge in and make this poor woman suffer. He cut off a few ribbons on her breasts, and continued to move the knife down.</p></p>

<p><p>Celina&rsquo;s eyes twitched as the image continued to haunt her mind.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No&#8230;&rdquo; she muttered in disbelief. &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t give up his power for me&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jiax smiled and stared at her perversely as his hand was holding her legs, and his head was between them. &ldquo;Oh, he cares about you more than you think. After all, you are his greatest treasure. And I can see why.&rdquo; Then he shoved his face between her legs and started munching again.</p></p>

<p><p>Celina screamed and her head tossed and turned as he violated her in ways that no one has done to her before. Her fingers grabbed the pillow tightly, and tears dripped from her eyes as she screamed at the top of her lungs.</p></p>

<p><p>Celina woke up a little dazed. When her eyes opened a little, she saw a man standing in front of her. She blinked a few times and her vision became more focused, and realized that there actually was a man standing in front of her. When Celina realized that it was Jiax, she was so shocked and scared that she was about to scream, but no sound came from her mouth.</p></p>

<p><p>There was no time to wonder how or why he is here, but other than the fact that he is, and she was in danger. He was exactly how she remembered him - he had the eyes of a demon and a killer, a bastard of a man who&rsquo;d do anything to get what he wants.</p></p>

<p><p>Celina sat up and clutched the blanket close to her chest. Her eyes were shaking in fear.</p></p>

<p><p>Jiax drew his sword and held it high.</p></p>

<p><p>Tears dripped from Celina&rsquo;s eyes from pure fear. This is probably the worst-case scenario that can happen&#8230;she was naked, her hands clinging onto the blanket, the only thing covering her body. She was weaponless and completely defenseless, and about to be attacked by a killer with a sword. Celina just woke up, and found herself in a comprising situation.</p></p>

<p><p>At first she thought it was a dream, but he is real and in the flesh. And without any way of defending herself, her life was on the line. How will Celina get out of this situation?</p></p>

<p> <p>In the first few seconds of consciousness, Alex saw Sui Long&rsquo;s face. Apparently, he was feeding Alex water while he was unconscious.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Cheng? You are awake. Thank goodness.&rdquo; said Sui Long.</p></p>

<p><p>Alex got out of bed and put a hand over his head. &ldquo;Ugh&#8230;what a headache. How long have I been asleep?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It has been over six hours.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I must have been really tired. What are you doing here? I thought I told you to go back?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;There are certain orders that I cannot comply with. My job is to protect you, and I intend to carry out that duty despite your wishes.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You were watching me during the duel, yes?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I saw the whole fight. It was painful to watch, but in the end you triumphed. You&rsquo;re improving every day.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Alex reached around the bed, looking for something. Sui Long handed him the Fire Sword, and Alex sighed in relief. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t want to lose this again.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It was a duel to the death, that was the agreement, correct? Why did you not kill him?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Killing in cold blood isn&rsquo;t my style.&rdquo; Alex replied. &ldquo;Besides, I&rsquo;m sure Khan would have done the same if he was in my position. I can sense that about him.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;If you say so.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh right, I promised Celina I would go back to her as soon as it&rsquo;s over.&rdquo; Suddenly, his eyes grew wide open as if he&rsquo;s seen a ghost. &ldquo;Celina&rsquo;s in danger!&rdquo; He grabbed the Fire Sword, flipped the blanket off his body and hopped off the bed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I can feel it. I need to see her now or I might never see her again!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;Attack_while_sleep_2&quot;></a>Attakced While Sleeping 1</p></p>

<p><p>Jiax&rsquo;s shadow covered Celina as she watched in pure fear. Her eyes were shaking as she stared at this horrible man, wondering what he will do. One hand was on the bed, and the other hand was clutching the blanket close to her naked body, and her body was trembling and shaking all over.</p></p>

<p><p>She was so shocked that she could not even scream, but just watched, paralyzed. Jiax raised his sword high and brought it down.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;AAAAAH!!!&rdquo; screamed Celina. *Slish* It cut the blanket between her legs, making an incision. It was <strong>this</strong> close to her womanhood. But next time he will not miss. Jiax raised his sword and slashed again, and Celina squirmed to the side, and the blade hit the blanket, almost hitting her leg. *Slish*</p></p>

<p><p>She was completely helpless against a man with a weapon&#8230;after all, what can she do without any weapons or clothes? Jiax aimed at her head, and she quickly dodged and crawled backwards. *Slish* He managed to cut off pieces of her hair.</p></p>

<p><p>She quickly grabbed a pillow and blocked his next attack. *Tffffff* The pillow was cut in half and feathers flew all over the place. Everything happened in slow motion and the feathers slowly drifted in the air. Jiax was grinning wickedly while she gasped and stared at him with frightful eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>What a predicament for Celina to be in, to be trapped with a killer in the bedroom, and her life was on the line. The man who once raped her is now trying to kill her, the very same person that haunts her memories day in and day out&#8230;and she is here, all alone, with this madman, who is out to take her life. No one was here to help her.</p></p>

<p><p> She seemed like a deer in headlights, her body frozen and not knowing what to do. She had nothing to defend herself with&#8230;nothing but her own flesh.</p></p>

<p><p>It was nightfall and there was no one on the streets, no one except for one. <strong>Alex</strong> ran as fast as he could back to the house from where he came from. For some reason, he was absolutely certain that Celina&rsquo;s life was in danger. One can say it is a sixth sense that he has developed in order to protect his loved one.</p></p>

<p><p>But he was still exhausted from the duel, and he had not properly rested, and he was out of breath. Alex grabbed the wall and panted for breath. He knew that time was running out for Celina, for if he does not make it on time, he might never see her again. He must push his body to the limit and get back to her as soon as possible. Hopefully, Celina will do fine&#8230;</p></p>

<p><p>Jiax raised the sword high and brought it down, and Celina quickly dodged to the side. &ldquo;Aaaah!!!&rdquo; The blade hit the pillow next to her. *Plop* She rolled out of the bed and fell on the floor. *Thud* She was lying there sideways, watching in horror as Jiax pulled the sword out of the bed while he stared at her. For some reason, her body felt weaker and heavier, and she was unable to move. Maybe she just woke up, or maybe she was paralyzed by fear.</p></p>

<p><p>What will she do in this situation? Poor Celina is just a woman, attacked while she was off guard, and the moment she woke up, she was thrown into this life and death situation without warning. Celina watched helplessly like a fallen bird, her hand clinging onto the blanket, the only thing she had to cling to in the world. The blanket covered everything from her breasts to her lower thighs, but covering herself up will mean nothing if she is hit by his blade.</p></p>

<p><p>In this situation, she was nothing but a naked woman, watching the madman approach her. Will she escape before the hard steel penetrates her flesh?</p></p>

<p><p>His shadow covered her, and he grinned evilly. It was not just any grin, but the grin of a villain about to do something wicked, the grin of a devil about to make a sacrifice. Jiax swings his sword at her, and she quickly rolled out of harm&rsquo;s way. *Cling* The blade hit the floor.</p></p>

<p><p>Jiax continued to slash at her, while Celina rolled away and screamed for her dear life. He slashed like a madman, laughing as he did, and he cut some of the curtains in the room.</p></p>

<p><p>Jiax stabbed at her, and she rolled out of the way, and the sword plunged itself into ground, stabbing the loose part of the blanket. The curtains fell on him and he could not see and struggled with it, and his back hit a jar and he fell down. *Crash*</p></p>

<p><p>This was her golden chance to escape, and Celina pulled the blanket desperately to get it loose. Jiax was struggling and groaning as he tried to get the curtains off. Celina pulled and pulled, her heart pounding rapidly. Jiax stood up and walked towards her. She pulled hard and tore a piece of the blanket.</p></p>

<p><p>Celina stood up and backed away to the wall, her hands clinging on the blanket, never letting it fall off. That is the last thing she needs in this situation. Jiax pulled the sword out of the floor, and Celina ran to the other side of the room.</p></p>

<p><p>Ever since Jiang asked for Cheng&rsquo;s whereabouts, Tai grew worried, and ordered a search for Cheng and Lady Ce. It has been several minutes since then, and he was becoming impatient. At last, one of his men came back to report to him. The soldier bowed. &ldquo;Captain Tai, we have searched the entire imperial complex, but there are no signs of Alex Cheng or Lady Ce.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not in the palace?&rdquo; Tai said. (Where are they? Could it be&#8230;)</p></p>

<p><p>Celina ran down the dark hallway like she never ran in her life. She had no destination in mind; all she wanted to do was to escape from the psycho. There was a set of stairs in front of her, and she took a wrong step and fell down painfully. *Thud thud thud*</p></p>

<p><p>She lay on the floor semi-conscious, unable to get up. But when she heard Jiax&rsquo;s sinister footsteps from the top floor, Celina opened her eyes. She forced herself to get up, no matter how hard it was, for if she does not, the consequences will be unthinkable. She was limping across the hall, with one hand on the wall and one hand over her blanket.</p></p>

<p><p>There was a room in front of her, and she opened the door and shut it and rested against the door. She panted for breath, as she was never this scared before. Her heart was beating rapidly, and she had shortness of breath.</p></p>

<p><p>This is a hopelessly desperate situation for her. She was weaponless and weak, and on top of that, wearing nothing but a <strong>white blanket</strong>. There was no time to even think about what to do, all she could do was run away. Time is of the essence, and she had better do something, otherwise it could be her end. Maybe, just maybe if she stalled long enough, then someone will come save her?</p></p>

<p><p>There was no time to even rest, as the tip of the blade came out of the door. *Crack* It was in close proximity to Celina&rsquo;s face, and she screamed in shock as she saw the blade. She fell on the floor on her bottom, and just watched as Jiax tried to cut the door open. *Crack* The blade went through the door, making punctures.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re in there!&rdquo; said the haunting voice from outside. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming to get you&#8230;&rdquo; *Crack*</p></p>

<p><p>Eventually, he broke the door open, and he approached in his usual threatening manner. Celina realized that this could be the end of her as she knew it. The entrance from which he came in is the only way out, and she was trapped.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, please!&rdquo; She crawled backwards as approached. &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jiax knew that this is it for her, there will be no more running away.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please, no! No!!!&rdquo; she pleaded.</p></p>

<p><p>But pleas mean nothing to him, for he was itching to shed some blood.</p></p>

<p><p>The man in the darkness was standing there, with his deadly sword, the sword that he will use to slice his victim into pieces. Lightning flared, showing his brute face for a split second.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No! Please!&rdquo; cried Celina, lying on the floor. She crawled back as he approached ever so slowly. &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jiax brought the sword down like an axe, and it hit the floor between her legs. *Chop* Celina screamed as the blade was this close to her womanhood. Then he swings it at her, and she tilted her head back to avoid it. *Slish* Pieces of her hair was cut, and she rolled away from him.</p></p>

<p><p>Celina stood up and backed away to the wall. There was no room to run to now, for he was directly in front of her. Each step he took towards her was one step closer to her demise. Her blanket was cut in several places, and it was the only thing protecting her precious body from this rapist and murderer.</p></p>

<p><p>Tears dripped down Celina&rsquo;s eyes as she gasped and feared for her life. The blanket was a little loose, and it fell off. Now she was completely exposed, and Jiax saw everything. His eyes widened and lit up and his smile grew wider.</p></p>

<p><p>The worst that can possibly happen has happened, Celina was now standing naked in front of him, a killer with a weapon, with no means of escape. Tears drip down her eyes as she wondered what fate awaits her.</p></p>

<p><p>Jiax raised the blade high and swings it at her, and Celina screamed. &ldquo;AAAAHHHHH!!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p> <p>Celina retreated until her back was against the wall. Now there was no where to run to. Each step Each step he took towards her was one step closer to her demise. Her hands clutched the loose blanket tightly against her bosom, as it was the only thing protecting her precious body from this rapist and murderer.</p></p>

<p><p>Jiax had a maniacal grin on his face, unable to contain his excitement and lust. He pointed his broadsword at her and stepped forward until the blade&rsquo;s tip touched her forehead. She was even more scared than before.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now, should I kill you right away? That is my assignment. But...&rdquo; The blade went her cheek, making her turn slightly to the side. Her eyes were shaking as her focus never left the blade. &ldquo;That would be such a waste. Maybe I should torture you...slowly...&rdquo; He glided the blade&rsquo;s tip to her jaw, then down to her neck. He glided the tip to her shoulder, running along her upper arm.</p></p>

<p><p>Then he removed the tip from her arm, and put the tip at her shin. The blanket was tied at her breasts, leaving an opening near her left thigh, resembling the slit of a dress. He glided the tip of her exposed leg upwards towards her knee. Then glided it to her upper thigh until it hit the blanket. Then the blade went under the blanket to flip it. &ldquo;I am curious to see what&rsquo;s down there!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jiax pointed the tip at the back of her left hand. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you tired of holding it?&rdquo; He poked her hand, causing her to wince. It hurt just enough to not make her bleed. Her left hand dropped to the side. Then he pointed the tip at her right hand. &ldquo;Just let it go.&rdquo; He poked her hand, causing her hand to drop to the side. And now, there was only one more step before this wolf will skin this sheep completely.</p></p>

<p><p>He raised the sword over his head. Celina gasped. He swings the sword down, causing the tip to cut the blanket&rsquo;s knot on her bosom. Her blanket fell on her feet. *plop*</p></p>

<p><p>One can tell the delight on Jiax&rsquo;s face as he saw her completely naked before him. The room was dark, completely devoid of light except for the moon. From the end of the room, one can see her naked, but her features covered by the darkness. But from Jiax&rsquo;s distance, he can see everything.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How about I cut your pretty face? Should I start from this side?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Or this side?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>glided the blade to her sternum, between her breasts</p></p>

<p><p>glided down the stomach, the waist, around the thigh</p></p>

<p><p>she can&rsquo;t take it and falls on her knees, pulls up blanket</p></p>

<p><p>jiax bends down and tortures her some more</p></p>

<p> <p>While running, Sui Long finally caught up to Alex. &ldquo;Cheng!&rdquo; he shouted.</p></p>

<p><p>Alex continued to push and push, but he found himself not able to run any longer. He collapsed on the street from pure exhaustion. Sui Long went to his aide. &ldquo;Cheng?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Celina&#8230;I have to save Celina&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You are in no condition to do so.&rdquo; said the masked bodyguard.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But&#8230;she is in danger&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I shall go in your place.&rdquo; His dedicated bodyguard ran stealthily down the street.</p></p>

<p> <p><a name=&quot;Runaway_horse_cart&quot;></a>Runaway on a Horse Cart</p></p>

<p><p>Celina was kneeling on the floor, nearly her entire body was covered by the white blanket, except her arms and shoulders. She was panting for breath. Jiax stood before her, snickering and smiling at her. He bent down and grabbed her hair, yanking her head up.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You thought I was dead, didn&rsquo;t you? Heh heh. I&rsquo;ll keep coming back for you because you&rsquo;re my woman.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please...stop...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh heh.&rdquo; Jiax&rsquo;s eyeballs darted to the side and he turned around. Zi was in the room. Celina gasped in surprise. It was a relief to see someone else, especially a friend.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You are a sneaky one. You snuck in here undetected like a rat.&rdquo; Jiax drew his blade and charged.</p></p>

<p><p>Zi&rsquo;s blade knocked his blade to the side and stabbed him in the chest. *Schleb*</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; Jiax coughed blood and he fell against the wall, and slowly slid down.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Lady Ce...or Celina?&rdquo; Zi bent down and placed his palms on her shoulders.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please, no more!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, Zi! Alex&rsquo;s friend.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No more. Please.&rdquo; She fell into his shoulder. He grabbed her shoulders to push her away to find out she fell unconscious. He lowered her back so that she was horizontal and lifted her up along with the blanket and dashed out of the house.</p></p>

<p><p>Jiax exited the building, stumbling around with a hand over his bleeding wound. &ldquo;Ugh&#8230;damn it. I&rsquo;m losing blood.&rdquo; He went to an alley where no one could see him. He stared at his own palms full of blood. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t transform. Don&rsquo;t transform!&rdquo; His hands started to change color and shape, his finger nails became talons and his palm became larger. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t transform. Or else I will be exposed here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sui Long came back to his lord to report the bad news. Alex, upon seeing him, anxiously grabbed his chest. &ldquo;Did you find the Celina? How is she?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I am sorry.&rdquo; Sui replied while staring off to the side. &ldquo;By the time I got to the house, she was already gone. There was no trace of her.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Alex wanted to deny it, but at this time, what is the point? He loosened his grip on Sui&rsquo;s clothing and slowly let himself fall on his knees. Today was supposed to be a victorious day, but it turned out to be a day of grievance... for Celina, the person he wants to see the most, is no where to be found.</p></p>

<p> <p>Zi carried Celina towards a horse cart full of hay. He placed her on the hay and then hopped on himself. Fortunately there were large barrels of wine. He placed the barrels on the outside of the cart, so he and Celina can be on the inside, hiding behind them. The driver, unaware of the intruders, pulled the reigns, causing the horses to move.</p></p>

<p><p>There was a lot of unusual activity in the capital. Soldiers were everywhere and they seemed restless. Some of them were looking for something, while others were downright confused.</p></p>

<p><p>Zi was resting against the wall, with Celina sitting next to him, her head resting against his shoulder. If the soldiers decide to search this cart, it will be bad news for them. There was a carpet underneath them. He put Celina flat on the hay, with himself on top of her, and put the carpet above them. There was small gap between the hay and carpet where he could see the outside. This was the perfect hiding place &ndash; they cannot be seen but he can still see.</p></p>

<p><p>Two soldiers stopped the cart. &ldquo;Hold it. Where are you going?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I am delivering wine to my lord&rsquo;s mansion.&rdquo; said the driver. &ldquo;Is something the matter?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We need to search your belongings.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>One of the soldiers went to the back of the cart to inspect. He saw barrels of wine and a lot of hay, nothing unusual here. He leaned in to take a closer look.</p></p>

<p><p>Zi was really nervous. Celina was unconscious, unaware of the danger they were in. He remained perfectly still and even held his breath.</p></p>

<p><p>There was hay on her nose and it tickled. Then her nose was twitching and her mouth became slightly ajar, indicating she was about to sneeze. Zi placed his lips on top of hers to stop her from making a noise.</p></p>

<p><p>Her throat made a soft moan that was barely audible. &ldquo;mmmmmmm&#8230;&rdquo; Her eyes twitched. Her fingers squeezed the hay.</p></p>

<p><p>The soldier was done inspecting and he left Zi&rsquo;s field of vision. &ldquo;Nothing but wine here.&rdquo; he reported to another soldier.</p></p>

<p><p>The driver got the green light and he pulled the reigns, making the horses move again.</p></p>

<p><p>Zi released the kiss and took deep sigh in relief.</p></p>

<p><p>The driver went to a barn. He hopped off the horse and disappeared somewhere. Zi took Celina and went inside the stable. As expected the floor was full of hay and it smelled bad. There were two rows of horses with an aisle in the middle.</p></p>

<p><p>He placed the woman gently on the hay and wiped the sweat off his forehead. &ldquo;Phew.&rdquo; The riskiest part of the journey is over and they are safe in this barn.</p></p>

<p><p>Moments later, her eyes blinked a few times and she woke up. She sat up. &ldquo;Huh? Zi Lai?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So the sleeping beauty woke up at last.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in a barn. I saved your life from that bad guy, remember?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Celina took a sigh of relief and smiled. &ldquo;I remember now. I owe you one.&rdquo; She looked down at her blanket. &ldquo;Why am I dressed like this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I was in a hurry&#8230;there wasn&rsquo;t time for finding clothes.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Celina stood up with her hands clutching the blanket against her bosom. &ldquo;Tell me, where exactly are we?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I hopped into a horse cart and I wasn&rsquo;t paying attention.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The horse behind her sniffed her ponytail, startling her a bit. She caressed the horse&rsquo;s face. Suddenly, the horse bit her blanket and yanked it. &ldquo;Ugh! Stop!&rdquo; She struggled to keep her blanket on. The horse whined and yanked it, pulling it off her body.</p></p>

<p><p>Zi saw her completely naked. She screamed and covered herself and fell on her knees. He was frozen for a moment. Then he snapped out of it and went to the horse to get the blanket back. The horse was defiant and would not let go. Zi kept pulling and pushing the horse&rsquo;s face until it finally let go.</p></p>

<p><p>He put the blanket on top of Celina to cover her up. She was relieved and pleasantly surprised he&rsquo;s such a gentleman. &ldquo;T-thank you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p> <p><a name=&quot;Attack_in_barn&quot;></a>Attacked in a Barn</p></p>

<p><p>Zi went to fetch some water. Celina was sleeping inside the horse stable, lying sideways. A soldier snuck into the barn, walking stealthily. He saw two horses on the left row and two on the right. All the horses were asleep and silent. At the end of the stable there was an empty room. He walked towards that room and pushed the wooden door open. Creek.</p></p>

<p><p>Celina was not asleep yet and she sat up, startled. The soldier&rsquo;s eyes lit up and his jaw nearly dropped. She was so scared that she just stared like a deer in headlights.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing in here, miss?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She clutched the blanket against her bosom.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know it&rsquo;s dangerous to stay in a place like this? I&rsquo;m tired of searching for enemies so I guess I&rsquo;ll play with you instead!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She stood up and backed away to the wall. &ldquo;No&#8230;no&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Come here baby!&rdquo; He drew his sword and pointed it in her direction.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No&#8230;stay away!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He raised his blade and took a soft swing at her, she evaded to the left. He took baby swings at her as she dodged. She pushed the doors out of the way and ran into the main room. She tripped over something and fell on her knees. She crawled on all fours towards the window in front of her. She grabbed the window to lift herself on one knee. The soldier&rsquo;s blade touched her cheek and she gasped.</p></p>

<p><p>It was inches away from her neck and he can kill her at any time.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you turn around and show me that nice body of yours?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She did not move. Her back was exposed to him, and she was trapped against the wall. She was at his mercy.</p></p>

<p><p>He glided the blade down to her shoulder. He poked the tip against her skin. She winced and reacted to it. &ldquo;Uhh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He enjoyed that and wanted to torture her some more. The blanket was draped over her lower back, so most of her back was exposed. Her pale, white skin. The tip brushed her pony tail and touched her right shoulder. He poked it deep enough to hurt her, but not enough to make her bleed. &ldquo;Uhhh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The tip went to her right lateral, the muscle that has triangular shape. He poked it. &ldquo;Uhhh.&rdquo; He kept poking various places on her skin. &ldquo;Uhhh. Uhhh. Uhhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The soldier laughed maniacally.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Uhhh! Uhhh! Uhhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He glided the blade&rsquo;s tip to her right shoulder and poked it again. &ldquo;Uhh!&rdquo; Her right arm was planted on the wall, elbow bent at a right angle. He glided the tip along the contents of her arm, poking it at various places. The tip went to her elbow, then up her forearm. &ldquo;Uhhh! Uhhh!&rdquo; He poked her wrist. Then the back of her hand. He poked it, causing her fist to uncurl.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Turn around.&rdquo; He demanded.</p></p>

<p><p>He pointed the blade at her neck and poked her. &ldquo;Uhhh.&rdquo; She finally turned around. Her hands clutched over the blanket over her bosoms. Her eyes shaking and panting for breath.</p></p>

<p><p>She escaped Jiax only to face this rapist in the same situation. She must be the unluckiest woman in the world.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes&#8230;I want to see you, all of you. Why don&rsquo;t you be a good girl and drop those hands?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She clutched the blanket even tighter.</p></p>

<p><p>He pointed the tip at the ball of her neck. &ldquo;Drop them.&rdquo; He waited but she did not do it. &ldquo;So stubborn eh?&rdquo; He pointed the tip at her left shoulder. And poked it like before. She winced. &ldquo;Uhhh.&rdquo; The tip glided itself to her upper arm and poked it. &ldquo;Uhhh!&rdquo; He poked it in various places towards her elbow. He poked it. &ldquo;Uhhh!&rdquo; He pointed at her forearm and poked it. &ldquo;Uhhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He pointed it at her hand and poked it. &ldquo;Uhhh.&rdquo; Her left arm dropped to the side, trembling from the pain. He pointed the tip at her right hand and poked it. &ldquo;Uhhh.&rdquo; Her right hand dropped to the side.</p></p>

<p><p>The blanket fell off her body and landed on her feet. *plop* Now she stood before this rapist completely naked, and he can see everything. He had a scary evil grin on his face.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have my way with you. And then I will kill you! Ahahahahahah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, a blade went through his stomach. *Schleb* He looked down and he was surprised.</p></p>

<p><p>Celina screamed and her hand instinctively covered her mouth.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...not now...I was so close.&rdquo; Zi pulled the blade out of his stomach, causing blood to squirt out of his wound. He lost all strength and he fell on his knees and palms. His trembling right hand reached towards her, about to fall at any moment. He felt like he can grab the naked woman standing before him if only he can reach further. He lost all strength and fell face flat on the hay.</p></p>

<p><p>Usually, a man in his position should be considered fortunate to be able to see a such a gorgeous naked woman, even for a few seconds. Soldiers are not considered attractive to women, so the only action the unmarried ones can get is from brothels. But brothels are expensive, so it is rare soldiers can go. But this soldier was so close to having this woman, that he died full of regret.</p></p>

<p><p>Zi said, &ldquo;I made it in time.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Celina screamed and covered herself, then fell on her knees. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look!&rdquo; she shrieked.</p></p>

<p><p>Zi turned around nonchalantly. &ldquo;Alright. I didn&rsquo;t see anything anyways.&rdquo; He grabbed the soldier&rsquo;s ankle and dragged him away. &ldquo;Let me get this guy out of here so you don&rsquo;t have to look at him.&rdquo; He dragged the man&rsquo;s body along the hay, then made a right turn into one of the empty stables. Zi left the body in there and came back out.</p></p>

<p><p>Celina was kneeling, blanket wrapped around herself, and shaking uncontrollably.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone. You&rsquo;re safe now.&rdquo; said he.</p></p>

<p><p>She showed no reaction to his words. The poor girl was so shaken up she can&rsquo;t even speak. Suddenly, she stood up and buried her face into his chest and cried. She sobbed non-stop.</p></p>

<p><p>Zi was startled, but then he relaxed. He embraced her.</p></p>

<p><p>She was sobbing and shaking. Maybe there&rsquo;s something he can do to calm her down. He got a naughty idea. His right hand slid down to grab her butt cheek. She was sobbing so much that she showed no reaction to it. His left hand grabbed her butt cheek and squeezed them.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, her legs lost strength, and she started to fall. Zi fell with her, and they were kneeling before each other. She wrapped her arms around his neck and buried her face into his chest and sobbed more.</p></p>

<p><p>Their cheeks were touching and she smelled nice. Zi thought Alex is a lucky man.</p></p>

<p><p> He had another idea. When she was calmer, he gently pushed her shoulders off his chest, so that they could face each other. Suddenly, he leaned in to kiss her lips. Her eyes grew wide open from the shock, she did not know how to react to it. Overwhelmed with emotions, her body did not respond to her. The tears keep streaming down her cheeks.</p></p>

<p><p>Then her eyes slowly closed and she fell unconscious. Zi released the kiss, holding her by the back. &ldquo;Oi, are you alright?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zi gently lay her on the hay. Something is not right with her, her face is more pale than normal. He placed her hand inside his hands, her hand was cold as ice. He touched her forehead and it felt. He was sure she has a cold. He had to do something or she&rsquo;ll die. In ancient times, if someone catches the common cold, they will likely die.</p></p>

<p><p>The blanket wasn&rsquo;t enough to keep her warm. So there&rsquo;s only one way&#8230;he had his reservations but he shook it off. It&rsquo;s for saving her life, right? And he&rsquo;s a man&#8230;alone in a barn with a naked woman. No one will know.</p></p>

<p><p>He crawled on top of her and hesitated for a second, wondering if he will go through with this. He lied down on top of her, placing his face on her sternum, his chin touching her breast.</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;assassin_in_barn&quot;></a>Assassin's sneak attack</p></p>

<p><p>On the barn rooftop, an assassin crawled upwards silently. He found a gap in the roof and peered in. To his surprise, he saw a man lying on top of a woman. She was covered by a white blanket. From the bottom only her feet were protruding out of the blanket. From the top, her arms and shoulders were exposed. He wondered if she was naked and he grew excited and continued to watch patiently.</p></p>

<p><p>As Zi was lying on top of the unconscious woman, he did nothing but wait patiently. Even though the blanket was in the way, he can still feel the contents of various parts of her body. His chin was on top of her breast, and he can feel its softness and firmness. His left arm was draped over her chest, and it felt nice against his arm. His legs were opened at an angle to encapsulate her legs. He can feel her legs&rsquo; texture...firm like a sofa but smooth as silk. Somehow, he can tell it&rsquo;s woman&rsquo;s leg, even with the blanket. What would it feel like without the blanket in the way?</p></p>

<p><p>He also noticed that she smelled good. It was hard to describe her smell, as she did not freshen up recently, but she smelled good nonetheless.</p></p>

<p><p>Zi could feel every time her diaphragm contracted and expanded. Her breaths were long and hard instead of steady like a healthy person should be. The sickness was affecting her, and it showed in her breathing and her body temperature.</p></p>

<p><p>Occasionally he would look at her face to check for changes. Her skin was pale and her eyes seem to be jumping out of their eyelids. Her lips have lost their color and became grayish. All signs point to her being in pain.</p></p>

<p><p>The assassin grew impatient as nothing was happening. He was <strong>Gui</strong>, a fallen monk turned assassin who was hired by the demon duke as a sellsword. But since the rebellion in the palace, Gui disappeared and has not be seen...until now.</p></p>

<p><p>Despite his efforts, Celina&rsquo;s body still felt cold, like that of a corpse. Zi had no choice but to try something else. He lifted his head up to stare at her cleavage. He wanted to see her bare breasts and swallowed hard. His fingers grabbed the blanket and pulled it down until they were exposed. He put his mouth on it and kissed it. It felt just like a meat bun except it is a hundred times better. He continued to kiss it and suck on it while his left hand grabbed the other breast and squeezed it between his fingers.</p></p>

<p><p>Celina breathed harder in reaction to this and her head turned slightly. It is unknown if she is conscious or not, but she can definitely feel everything being done to her.</p></p>

<p><p>From his angle, Gui could not see her breasts, but he was getting excited. He wanted to see more action and watched with lustful eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>Zi&rsquo;s lips went to her sternum and kissed it all over, causing her head to tilt back a little. Her lips parted as if to make a sound, but if she did, the sound she made was so quiet it was inaudible. His lips made their way to her neck and he kissed it from the bottom to the top, causing her head to shift around. She let out quiet moans.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes...yessss...&rdquo; said Gui. From a bird&rsquo;s eye view he could see their bodies clearly in detail. He liked the expression on the woman&rsquo;s face...her eyes were shut and she was in agony...what a nice expression.</p></p>

<p><p>As Zi continued to violate her he became gradually more aggressive. His kissed her neck at different angles, causing her head to shift around. She moaned softly. &ldquo;Uhhh. Uhhh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zi&rsquo;s hand reached down and grabbed her thigh though the blanket. The white fabric was in the way so he kept pulling it up. His lips kissed her cheek all over. His hand pulled the blanket up to thigh, revealing her left leg. His hand caressed her thigh, moving it up and down. Then his hand went deeper into the blanket.</p></p>

<p><p>Celina felt several things at once and she moaned. &ldquo;Uhhh! Uhhh!&rdquo; He lips were smooching her cheek while his hand was on her inner thigh...and maybe even deeper than that.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Zi felt a jolting pain on his neck and he slapped his neck, thinking it was a fly. Instead he pulled out a sharp but thin, nearly invisible <strong>needle</strong>. His eyes widened. Suddenly, he heard a whoosh sound and looked in that direction. Gui just landed on the hay. He did his signature laugh, which sounded like hyena noises. &ldquo;Hyeh hyeh hyeh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zi stood up and drew his sword. &ldquo;You...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I was waiting patiently for you to do something to the girl, but you were so slow I couldn&rsquo;t wait anymore! Hyeh hyeh hyeh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh? I&rsquo;m not gonna let you lay a hand on her!&rdquo; Zi dashed forward and slashed. Due to his small size and speed, Gui evaded all of his attacks seamlessly.</p></p>

<p><p>Zi looked down and noticed needles on his chest and thighs. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; Suddenly, he lost all feeling in his body and fell forward.</p></p>

<p><p>Gui let out another annoying laugh. &ldquo;Victory is mine! You got careless!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh...I can&rsquo;t move...&rdquo; Zi held his sword with a firm grip. Gui kicked the sword away.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now let me show you how it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No! Don&rsquo;t hurt her! She has a fever!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I see. In that case, I, Dr. Gui will be the one to cure her!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Gui stared at the helpless, unconscious woman covered by the sheet. He smiled wickedly, thinking of all the naughty things he can do to her.</p></p>

<p><p>The blanket covered her breasts down to her waist, most of her legs were exposed. Her shoulders and arms were exposed. Her eyes were still shut and has no idea what misfortune was about to befall her. He was getting excited just staring at her. All of her privates were covered, but a fair amount of skin was exposed.</p></p>

<p><p>Gui took a needle and stuck it into her arm. She winced. She has no idea what&rsquo;s happening to her but she still felt everything being done to her. *Schleb* He stuck another needle next to the first one. *Schleb* The needles lined up to her shoulder. He stuck a needle on the side of the shoulder. Then one on the shoulder blade.</p></p>

<p><p>He stared at her cleavage and smiled wickedly. He stuck a needle on the top of her right breast. She winced. He stuck one on her left breast. She winced. He stuck one between the breasts. The pain was adding up. Her eyebrows furrowed every time a needle was inserted into her skin. He stuck needles all over her sternum. He stuck one on her forehead.</p></p>

<p><p>Gui stared at her breasts with glittering eyes and a grabbing gesture. &ldquo;And now...it&rsquo;s time to inspect the goods.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Zi yelled.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hyeh hyeh! After all it&rsquo;s my job hyeh hyeh as a doctor. Hyeh hyeh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zi tried to move but it was futile.</p></p>

<p><p>It was a rare thing to see a woman&rsquo;s breasts but now he&rsquo;s finally going to see them. Gui&rsquo;s hands grabbed the blanket and pulled it down slowly. Finally he saw her bare breasts. They were so magnificent that her body seemed to be glowing brightly. They were the right shape and size.</p></p>

<p><p>Zi was unable to see a thing as Gui was kneeling in front of Celina. Gui stuck a needle on her, causing her to moan softly. He couldn&rsquo;t see where the needle was, but assumed he stuck it on her breast. Gui stuck another one, causing her to moan.</p></p>

<p><p>Gui then focused on her lower half. He pulled the blanket up a little bit higher, revealing more of her legs. He stuck needles into her calves. She moaned. He stuck them on the inside of her thighs as well as the top of her thighs. The needles were lined up on her revealed skin. And now there was only one thing to do. He pulled the blanket up some more, growing excited every second.</p></p>

<p><p>His hand touched the inside of her thigh and caressed it. His hand went higher, brushing against the blanket. His hand went deeper and deeper, until it finally hit her spot. She moaned. &ldquo;Uhhhh...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p> <p>Gui crawled between her legs and went <strong>under the blanket</strong>. Celina moaned in reaction to what he did. After a few seconds, Gui&rsquo;s head came out from the blanket and he was seen sucking on her breasts. Celina moaned with her head tossing left and right.</p></p>

<p><p>Gui kissed her sternum and neck and shoulder all over, having no self control. He let loose his inner animal. He pressed his cheek into her cheek. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry baby, Dr. Gui will take care of you.&rdquo; He licked her cheek, causing her to turn away.</p></p>

<p><p>He licked her jaw line, slobbering his filthy tongue all over her. He left drops of saliva all over her skin. He licked the side of her neck. Then her cheek. Then he licked her forehead.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Watch, this is how it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo; Gui grabbed her hair with one hand. He licked her cheek, causing her to grimace. Then he did the unthinkable. He planted his lips on top of hers. She made a muffled noise. &ldquo;Mmmmmm! Mmmmm!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Celina was lying on her front with her <strong>back</strong> exposed. The blanket covered only her waist area, down to halfway to her upper thighs. Gui kneeled on top of her buttocks and took out some needles from his sleeves. He stuck one into her lower back. She moaned softly. &ldquo;Uhhh.&rdquo; He stuck another one into a random place on her back. &ldquo;Uhhh.&rdquo; He stuck more and more needles as he grew more excited. Some of them went into her shoulders. One of them went into her neck.</p></p>

<p><p>Zi was watching and unable to do a thing. &ldquo;S-Stop it...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>When Gui was done he let out another hyena-like laugh. Then he lay down on top of her, positioning his face on her back. He pulled out a needle on her lower back, causing her to moan softly. Then he began to kiss that part of her skin. Each time he took out a needle, she moaned louder and louder. It was more painful than inserting the needles.</p></p>

<p><p>He kissed various parts of her back, sometimes licking it. Her skin tasted good. Next to them, the hay was full of needles, some of them with blood at the tip. Eventually, all the needles were out of her body and Gui continued to violate her back all over. Celina continued to moan as her fingers squeezed the hay.</p></p>

<p> <p>This whole time, Zi was using the meditation technique he learned from the temple. Oxygen filled his blood and his blood flow was restored, neutralizing the effects of the poison.</p></p>

<p><p>zi regains control of his body, kicks gui&rsquo;s ass</p></p>

<p><p>gui runs away</p></p>

<p><p>Zi went back to Celina, bent down and touched her forehead. She was till cold as ice. Laying on top of her was not going to work. Zi thought of another idea&#8230;but he shook it off because it&rsquo;s a bad idea. But is it...under the circumstances? Celina needs to start sweating or she will most likely die here. And they are alone in a barn in the middle of no where. A chance like this happens only once in a life time. He began to unzip his shirt.</p></p>

<p><p>On the hay a man&rsquo;s clothes lay scattered. Celina was lying on her front and Zi was lying on top of her. His face was in the middle of her back. He was shirtless as well as bottomless. The blanket covered him from the waist down, but most of their legs were exposed.</p></p>

<p><p>Her back felt so smooth and her body was so soft. Even though she was cold, her body felt warm inside the blanket. He was curious as to what her back tastes like. He closed his eyes and smooched her back and it tasted good. Her skin was smooth and creamy. It tastes so good it should be a crime. He kept kissing various parts of her back, working his way up to her shoulders. He sniffed her hair and sighed in pleasure.</p></p>

<p> <p><a name=&quot;Keep_her_warm&quot;></a>Survive the Cold: Keep Her Warm</p></p>

<p><p>Celina was lying down, covered by a blanket. But there was a man under her blanket, his head was on top of her breasts. He was moving constantly, making a rustling noise. She moaned and shrieked in reaction to what he was doing.</p></p>

<p><p>His head came out of the blanket. He caressed her <strong>breasts</strong> with his face and lips. His hands squeezed them like dough, pressing down on them, and going round and round. His face was between them, he motor boated them, turning left and right. He kissed her sternum with an open mouth kiss, as if trying to suck her skin.</p></p>

<p><p>Her left hand thrashed about, trying to hold onto something. Her hand found some hay and squeezed it. Her feet were kicking lightly with her toes curled.</p></p>

<p><p>He kissed her neck in the same manner, tasting her skin fully. He kissed her jaw line and cheek as she turned away, wincing. Her eyes twitched and her eyebrows narrowed from the pain.</p></p>

<p><p>He stopped to glance at her face. She still wasn&rsquo;t sweating, her body still felt cold. Zi looked to the side. It was a cold night in the city. The barn&rsquo;s door was slightly ajar. And the windows were just squares on the walls with nothing covering them. They were no different than being outside.</p></p>

<p><p>He needs to try something else. He also felt cold. So he had do this to keep himself warm as well.</p></p>

<p><p>Zi scooted down and put his head back into the blanket to violate her breasts.</p></p>

<p><p>Then he slid down to her stomach, kissing it on the way down. She moaned. Then he slid down to the area between her legs, her sacred area. She moaned harder and her fingers squeezed the hay. Her feet thrashed about, kicking the hay with her heel. He held her hips to keep her still as he did what he did under the blanket.</p></p>

<p><p>Then he scooted down some more. His head came out of the blanket&rsquo;s bottom side. He kissed her <strong>inner thigh</strong>, smooching it. She moaned a little. He made successive kisses towards her knee as his right hand caressed her thigh, moving it up and down. He kissed the knee at several angles. He kissed her calf. The calf is the muscle in the back of the leg, the top part is the roundest and thickest. He kissed the top of the her calf, then went down from there. His lips made their way to her ankle and kissed it. Her skin was cold like a bag of ice.</p></p>

<p><p>Violating her leg will not warm her up. He was lost in his lust and forgot his original purpose.</p></p>

<p><p>Zi was back in the same position, tucked under the blanket. His face was buried in her right shoulder and neck. He kissed her shoulder and she turned to the side. He kissed her neck while smelling it. His lips instinctively went to her cheek. Her skin was like a block of porcelain, it felt icy but smooth. He smooched her cheek, and his lips were right next to her lips.</p></p>

<p><p>He planted his <strong>lips</strong> on top of hers. &ldquo;Mmmmmmmm.&rdquo; She had a strong reaction to this. Her left arm began to move, her hand reaching for his shoulder. He felt her movement and his hand grabbed her wrist and pinned it against the hay. His fingers slid between her fingers to interlock them. Her hands were cold and lifeless, but they were soft and delicate and nice to touch. That is why he kept holding her hand to make it warmer.</p></p>

<p><p>Her right arm started to move and grabbed his ribs. His left hand did the same, it pinned her wrist to the hay and interlocked her fingers. &ldquo;mmmmmmm. mmmmmm.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>After an unknown amount of time, he stopped the kiss so he can breathe. *Sigh sigh* But she was still wasn&rsquo;t sweating. There is one final thing he can try - it&rsquo;s a last resort.</p></p>

<p><p>He planted his palms next to her shoulders and lifted his torso so that his back was bent. His face was above her face. He took a few seconds to mentally prepare and he started to stroke her.</p></p>

<p><p>The first ten times, she refrained from making a noise...all she could do was grunt quietly with her lips parted. &ldquo;Nnnnnnnggggggg...&rdquo; Her head turned sideways, her eyes twitched more than before, her eyebrows shook up and down. She gritted her teeth. &ldquo;Nnnggg! Nnnggg! Nnnggg!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>But she was unable to hold it in as the agony was unbearable. She started moaning. &ldquo;Uuuuuuuh! Uuuuuuuh!&rdquo; She moaned every time he stroked her.</p></p>

<p><p>The sensation was too good to describe...this has to be one of the top joys of being a man. Nay, this is without a doubt the number one physical pleasure for a man...to be able to make love to a beautiful naked woman.</p></p>

<p><p>Zi forgot all about his inhibitions and doubts that he had only moments ago. He was too turned on to think about anything else...in fact he cannot think at all. He can only feel one thing...he stroked her harder.</p></p>

<p><p>Gradually her moans became screams. &ldquo;UUUUUUUUH! UUUUUUH!&rdquo; Her left hand thrashed about until her fingers squeezed the hay tightly.</p></p>

<p><p>A sculptor places a nail on a <strong>block of ice</strong>. In his right hand was a hammer, and he banged the nail into the ice. Each stroke is him banging the hammer.</p></p>

<p><p>Her screams grew louder and more painful. &ldquo;UUUUUUUUH! UUUUUUH!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Even Zi was groaning from the sensations. He was so focused that he forgot about his surroundings, the fact that they&rsquo;re in a stranger&rsquo;s barn in an unknown part of town. He kept going, not resting even for one second. He was no different than a beast... he can only go faster or the same pace, but not slower.</p></p>

<p><p>Her head was tossing and turning left and right. Her feet kicked aimlessly, sometimes kicking Zi&rsquo;s feet while sometimes kicking the hay.</p></p>

<p><p>The sculptor kept banging the nail, hitting the <strong>ice block</strong> in the same place over and over. The nail went deeper and deeper into the ice.</p></p>

<p><p>Her head tilted upwards, her chin was facing up and her face was upside down. Her moans were painful, sound like a woman in labor. &ldquo;UUUUUUH! UUUUUUH!&rdquo; Her right hand squeezed the hay.</p></p>

<p><p>Occasionally her head would turn left and right many times. Her entire body shook from the pressure.</p></p>

<p><p><strong>*Bang bang*</strong> The sculptor kept banging the nail, the ice began to crack at the collision point.</p></p>

<p><p>Just like the ice, her sacred area was in immense pain. It is a soft and sensitive area and him stroking it repeatedly caused the pain to increase.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;UUUUUUUUH! UUUUUUH!&rdquo; Her legs kept thrashing about, causing the blanket to move up to her waist. Gradually, more and more of their legs were revealed. But because of how hard Zi was going, neither of them felt cold.</p></p>

<p><p>Sweat drops appeared on various parts of her skin. But Zi wasn&rsquo;t paying attention. By now, he forgot his original purpose. His eyes were shut just like Celina&rsquo;s so he could focus on the sensation.</p></p>

<p><p>*Bang bang* The ice cracked more...it was <strong>almost</strong> at the breaking point.</p></p>

<p><p>Her screams were so loud, someone can hear them if they were outside the barn. Zi&rsquo;s grunting became louder and more aggressive. He took deep breaths as he was using all the energy his body can afford. Sweat dripped down his forehead.</p></p>

<p><p>Sweat drops appeared on Celina&rsquo;s forehead and neck. Each time he stroked her, her head tilted back and she screamed. Also, the sweat on her face flew to the air.</p></p>

<p><p>*Bang bang* The ice cracked even more. The inevitable was coming.</p></p>

<p><p>Her head tilted back from each and every thrust. Tear drops appeared in the corner of her closed eyes and when she was stroked, her tear drops sparkled in the air. &ldquo;UUUUUUH! UUUUUUAAAAH!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> Zi did not let up, not even for one second. Each stroke was as powerful as the previous one. He was grunting with his eyes closed as if constipated, but he was without a doubt enjoying this, as this is the number one physical pleasure for a man. Celina&rsquo;s body was reaching its limit, as one can tell from her moans and her movements.</p></p>

<p><p>*Bang bang* The ice cracked even more.</p></p>

<p><p>Her fingers on both hands squeezed the hay without letting go even for one second, in fact she squeezed so hard that her palms were sweating. She squeezed so hard that if her nails dug into her own skin she would be bleeding. Her knees kept on bending and thrashing about more violently than ever. Her screams continued, with each one as loud as the one before. &ldquo;UUUUUUH! UUUUUUAAAAH!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>At this point, a man is no longer a man, his brain has turned off completely as is acting on pure instinct. He was a beast of lust and desire and this beast has already reached the point of no return.</p></p>

<p><p>Finally, after one more hit, the ice block cracked, breaking into a million pieces. *Smash*</p></p>

<p><p>Celina&rsquo;s chin tilted all the way up, hurting her neck, and she screamed at the top of her lungs. <strong>&ldquo;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!&rdquo; </strong>This one by far was the loudest and most painful scream she has let out tonight.</p></p>

<p><p>The horses woke up and screamed as well. Some galloped in place, scared and trying to escape their room. The barn was full of her scream and the screams of horses.</p></p>

<p><p>Her scream lasted a good ten seconds. Zi&rsquo;s ears were hurting but he was in such a state of ecstasy that it did not bother him.</p></p>

<p><p>After the deathly scream, he continued stroking her, not as hard as before, but hard enough to keep the momentum going. She continued to moan at the same intensity as she did before the deathly scream. But her moans sounded different than before, they were not as loud, but sounded more painful. They were no longer moans of pain, but moans of weeping and despair. &ldquo;UUUUAAH! UUUUAAH!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Her legs still thrashed about, but not as hard, as her body was growing exhausted. Her fingers clawed at the hay and squeezed it firmly.</p></p>

<p><p>The chunks of cracked ice lay scattered in place, and they were no longer one unit so they began to melt.</p></p>

<p><p>Celina&rsquo;s body was melting as well...she was sweating all over. At first, it was a couple of drops here and there. But now the drops were everywhere. Sweat from her forehead dripped down her cheeks. Sweat drops appeared on her breasts and shoulders. Sweat drops appeared on her arms and legs.</p></p>

<p><p>Despite how tired he was, Zi kept going, thrusting with his hips. Her groans of agony continue to echo throughout the barn. &ldquo;UUUUAAH! UUUUAAH!&rdquo; The horses were restless, all of them whining and moving in place.</p></p>

<p><p>Zi has reached his limit, and after one final stroke, he let out his last grunt, and then his face fell on her shoulder. He panted for breath through his nose and mouth, breathing directly into her ear.</p></p>

<p><p>Celina&rsquo;s moans stopped and after going through that ordeal, she finally received a break. Her breathing returned to normal as well, and her fists loosened up, but fingers still holding onto the hay. Her legs stopped moving.</p></p>

<p><p> After a minute, Zi noticed her sweat. He was relieved that she&rsquo;s going to survive the night and what he did worked. But he was still consumed by lust and he was not done with her yet.</p></p>

<p><p>He kissed her neck with an open mouth kiss, tasting her skin and her sweat. It tasted salty but mostly sweet...she even her sweat tastes good. She did not have an ounce of odor on her, but rather, she still smelled good. Not only does her skin taste good, her sweat tastes good, she even smells good...her existence is a feast for the senses. This woman is the embodiment of perfection. Zi wanted to taste her some more, his face went to her cheek and kissed it all over, until his nose bumped into her nose.</p></p>

<p><p>Celina let out soft moans in reaction to him. &ldquo;Uhhhh...uhhhh...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Then he went down to the front of her neck and kissed every inch of it, making sure to lick every drop of sweat off her skin. His face went down to her sternum and did the same. Then his face went to the top of her breasts. He sucked on her breasts and kissed them at every angle, making sure to get every drop of sweat.</p></p>

<p> <p><a name=&quot;After_the_rebellion&quot;></a>After the Rebellion</p></p>

<p><p>lei explains how she survived</p></p>

<p><p>in the kitchen - some guys was asking the cooks if they have a red feather</p></p>

<p><p>they answered no, there was a fight</p></p>

<p><p>lei gasped and hid inside the counter (under the sink)</p></p>

<p><p>she grabbed a red feather from one of the dead bodies</p></p>

<p><p>a guy came in and asked if lei has a red feather</p></p>

<p><p>she said yeah.</p></p>

<p><p>he said good job on killing those people, go to the next kitchen</p></p>

<p><p>lei sighed in relief, she hid somewhere</p></p>

<p> <p>Later, Tai showed up he bowed. &ldquo;Sir Cheng.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Captain Tai, there is no need for formalities between us.&rdquo; Alex replied.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But you are still the Demon Slayer, and must be addressed as such.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That title was given to me by Liu Bei. All I did was slay one demon. So, when no one else is around, you do not have to address me by titles.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tai smiled. &ldquo;You are humble indeed. I am finally beginning to see what Lady Ce sees in you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;She is still missing, isn&rsquo;t she? She is the one person that I want to see right now&#8230;I wonder where she could have gone to.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well, I have good news for you, Cheng.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Celina showed up with her servant, Lei. Alex&rsquo;s eyes widened. &ldquo;Celina?&rdquo; He jumped off the concrete and stared at her in disbelief. She was as happy to see him as he was.</p></p>

<p><p>Her lips naturally smiled and her eyes became filled with tears. &ldquo;Alex&#8230;&rdquo; She ran to his arms and they embraced. Their embrace was ever so tight, it is as if they were glued together.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Celina&#8230;where did you go? I was so worried about you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry! *Sob* I tried to find you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> Then they let go of each other. &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d never see you again&#8230;&rdquo; she said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No&#8230;I don&rsquo;t die easily. I thought that you were dead&#8230;I was looking all over for you.&rdquo; said Alex.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It must be heaven&rsquo;s blessing that we are both alive.&rdquo; Celina commented.</p></p>

<p><p>Tai and Lei smiled, silently agreeing that these two were meant for each other.</p></p>

<p><p> All this time, they had to keep their relationship a secret, but now it is okay, because no one else is watching, with the exception of trustworthy people such as Tai and Lei. Normally, Alex and Celina are quiet people, and the only exception is when they are with each other. When they do speak, they speak strongly, pouring out their emotions.</p></p>

<p> <p>As Lord Yu turned around and walked away, Zi showed up. &ldquo;Ah there you are, Alex. Lady Ce, it is a pleasure to see you, as always.&rdquo; He bowed.</p></p>

<p><p>Alex was not pleased with Zi today. &ldquo;Zi, where have you been the whole time? You missed the entire battle.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sorry pal.&rdquo; Zi replied with a big wide smile. &ldquo;I did not want to be involved in the Red Feather Rebellion. It is to o risky for a guy like me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You always avoid what&rsquo;s inconvenient for you. And you&rsquo;re always slacking. Man you never change, still as unreliable as ever.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Celina interrupted. &ldquo;Alex, don&rsquo;t say that. While you were away, I was attacked by an assassin and Zi rescued me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Is that true?&rdquo; asked Alex. &ldquo;I know Celina is telling the truth. I had no idea, sorry.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright.&rdquo; Zi replied. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get all serious on me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So you do have your uses. As long as women are involved, right?&rdquo; Alex said playfully. &ldquo;Since you&rsquo;re here, I might as well have you help with the palace repairs. As a matter of fact, I am putting you in charge of it.&rdquo; <a href=&quot;file:///C:/Users/E6440-1/Dropbox/My%20Documents/Fiction/Demon%20Slayer%20-%20Main/DS%20(B)%20-%20Volume%205-1%20-%20Journey%20to%20the%20Crimson%20Sea.doc#_ftn1&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref1&quot; title=&quot;&quot;>[1]</a></p></p>

<p><p>Zi raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;Me, in charge of it? What about you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take a page out of your book. I&rsquo;m going to slack off. There&rsquo;s someone I want to spend time with.&rdquo; He glanced at Celina, who blushed in reaction to it. &ldquo;Zi, you&rsquo;re responsible for the building restorations and the cleaning up of the corpses. When you&rsquo;re done write me an official document stating the number of deaths and the cost of the damages.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Very well. Consider it done, Lord Cheng.&rdquo; Zi bowed in a playful way and went off.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Alex, do you mean that?&rdquo; asked Celina.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Of course. There are some things more important than duty.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p> <hr /> <p><strong>Journey to the Crimson Sea</strong></p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;DS_Title&quot;></a>Journey to the Crimson Sea</p></p>

<p> <p><a name=&quot;DS_A&quot;></a>[A] - The Mysterious Map: Set Sail on the Tai Pei</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; cried the voice of a young constable, barging into his boss&rsquo;s office. &ldquo;Sir.&rdquo; He hurried over to the supervisor&rsquo;s desk, slamming a piece of paper on it.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked the police supervisor, sensing the man&rsquo;s urgency.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Another merchant carriage has been attacked by bandits in our area.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Damn it.&rdquo; said the supervisor, who is equally as frustrated as the constable is. &ldquo;This is the fifth attack this month. It must be the doing of the Wuyei Gang.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;To be able to cause us so much trouble, they are no ordinary bandits.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The supervisor stood up and walked towards the window. &ldquo;If this keeps up, no merchants would want to enter our town, and that would affect the town&rsquo;s economy drastically. Not only that, but the local magistrate will ignore us completely.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sir&#8230;&rdquo; said the constable.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We have no choice but to challenge the gang head on.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; the constable replied, saluting. &ldquo;I will gather our forces immediately.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Then the supervisor interjected: &ldquo;Oh and by the way...we have a special guest joining us in our mission.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>As ordered, the police officers arrived at bandit territory, all armed and ready to fight. Officers are to wear black uniforms, with the Chinese symbol of &ldquo;police&rdquo; sewed into the chest area.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, bandits came out of trees, and some came out of bushes, yelling out their war cries. The officers drew their weapons and bravely charged forward.</p></p>

<p><p><strong>Wuyang</strong>, the bandit leader, drew his sword, raised it in the air, and screamed. &ldquo;This is our territory! Show no mercy!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The two groups clashed their blades, and the place became a battlefield. The bandits and police clearly hated each other, and showed no mercy, stabbing at each other, and many were killed in the chaos.</p></p>

<p><p>In middle of their fighting, a certain man approached the danger, and no one noticed him until he got in the middle of the fight. His unique appearance was noticed by everyone friend and foe alike - his long silver hair, the yin yang symbol on his chest, and of course, his Fire Sword. He drew it out of its sheath and it glowed red.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Demon Slayer!&rdquo; shouted a bandit.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the one who slain Duke Xiang, the Savior of Shen!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sensing fear from his men, Wuyang shouted: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s only one man. Get him now!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The bandits shouted their battle cry and charged fearlessly at the hero. Alex&rsquo;s sword was already on fire and he charged into the group. *Slash* He cut their flesh and gave them a burning sensation at the same time. After he went past them, their clothes caught on fire as they fell to the ground injured.</p></p>

<p><p>Another group of bandits charged at him at the same time. <strong>&ldquo;Fire Storm!&rdquo;</strong> He swings his blade, creating a wave of fire that hit the bandits. Not only were they burned, but they were knocked onto the ground and instantly defeated.</p></p>

<p><p>Wuyang saw what happened and of course he was not pleased. &ldquo;Attack!&rdquo; shouted. More bandits showed up. The police had their hands full with the bandits but now even more of them showed. Alex realized that he was surrounded and Wuyang realized this too. Even with his Fire Sword this was too much for him. He charged at Wuyang and they clashed blades. Another bandit ran at Alex while he was occupied. Just when the bandit was about to strike him, Li Cheng appeared behind him and stabbed him through the chest. *Schleb*</p></p>

<p><p>Alex shoved the bandit leader away. &ldquo;Li! You made it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Li and Alex stood back to back as they were engulfed by a circle of enemies. &ldquo;Looks like you have your hands full.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We can take them.&rdquo; Alex replied confidently. &ldquo;We have fire and ice.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The bandits did their battle cry and charged at them. Li&rsquo;s Ice Sword glowed white and she slashed a bandit in the stomach. Not only that, but his wound turned into icicles as he fell. It felt exactly like being cut by ice itself, it was cold and hard. A bandit charged at her raising his blade sky high. Li cut him in the chest and he fell, with icicles on his sleeves.</p></p>

<p><p> Several more bandits attacked her but in vain, she cut them mercilessly. They all screamed as they fell to the ground. Some of them had icicles on their clothes.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s...the Ice Sword!&rdquo; A bandit exclaimed in fear. Li just cut another enemy down. Then she charged at this bandit and slashed him in the stomach. &ldquo;These guys are on a different caliber than us...ugh!&rdquo; He fell down and bled to death.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Take this. Ice Blizzard!&rdquo; Li Cheng swings her blade forward, creating a wave of ice, knocking down five enemies at once.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Fire Storm!&rdquo; Alex used this signature move right after Li, knocking down a large group of enemies.</p></p>

<p><p>Now, Wuyang the bandit leader was undefended. Alex went straight for him and attacked aggressively. Wuyang defended himself while stepping back. *Clang clang clang* Alex&rsquo;s Fire Sword broke Wuyang&rsquo;s blade, and the piece of it hit his shoulder. He fell down with blood dripping out of his wound.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh...I submit!&rdquo; said Wuyang. &ldquo;Have mercy!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Alex put his blade back into its sheath. &ldquo;Submit yourself to the local police. If you&rsquo;re smart you&rsquo;ll confess everything.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Of course. Thank you...&rdquo; Suddenly, a knife popped out of his sleeve and he stabbed. Alex grabbed his arm and threw him on the ground and broke his arm. *Crack* &ldquo;AAAAAAAGH!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Alex withstood his screaming without an ounce of guilt. He just stared at his foe with a cold look in his eyes. &ldquo;All you thieves are the same.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The police supervisor came personally to show Alex Cheng his gratitude. &ldquo;Thank you for coming out all this way from the capital, Demon Slayer. You&rsquo;ve helped us out a great deal.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sure thing.&rdquo; Alex replied. &ldquo;I was just doing my part to keep the peace.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;While we searched the bandits, we found this.&rdquo; He handed a scroll to Alex.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a treasure map. It&rsquo;s of no use to us. Maybe it&rsquo;ll be of interest to you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Alex unrolled the map to take a look. It was indeed a treasure map with an X marked on an island somewhere beyond the reach of the Shen Kingdom.</p></p>

<p><p> Alex Cheng kneeled in front of King Liu, presenting the map in his palms. Lord Yu took the map and handed it directly to the king. His eyes widened as he stared at its contents. &ldquo;This is...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes your highness.&rdquo; said Alex. &ldquo;This is the map to the Legendary Water Sword.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The Water Sword...&rdquo; Liu Cao repeated.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The legendary blacksmith Cho&rsquo;Ann forged the four elemental swords. The Fire Sword, the Ice Sword, the Thunder Sword and the Wind Sword. He did it at the request of the Four Brothers.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;And he also forged the fifth elemental sword?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It was not him. His student Sha&rsquo;Uri created the Water Sword.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Yu: &ldquo;I have heard of that legend, your highness. Sha&rsquo;Uri and Cho&rsquo;Ann were student and master and they had a disagreement and he left his master to forge his own ultimate weapon.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Liu Cao: &ldquo;This could be beneficial to our kingdom&rsquo;s prosperity. I want an expedition to find the Water Sword. General Tai.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hai.&rdquo; Tai stepped forward and kneeled.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You will be in charge of this mission. Keep it under the radar because we don&rsquo;t want the other kingdoms to be alarmed.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hai. Consider it done.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> Celina was standing on the side this whole time and she stepped to the center and kneeled next to Tai. &ldquo;Your highness, I want to be on this mission as well.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is no mission for an ambassador. We&rsquo;re going on a treasure hunt.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The seas are rampant with pirates. You&rsquo;re too valuable to go on such a dangerous mission.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hai.&rdquo; Celina replied. Her dissatisfaction was obvious but the king&rsquo;s orders are absolute, so she could not complain.</p></p>

<p><p>As Tai walked down an arbitrary hallway, Celina approached him. &ldquo;Tai.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The general turned around.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I still want to go on this mission.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But the king said-&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Celina interrupted him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lived in the Mu Fa Theatre and the palace all my life. I&rsquo;ve never been outside this city. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to sail the seas. I&rsquo;ve read about the sea in many books. This is my one chance to go on an adventure.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is not some field trip. The river and sea we will cross is full of pirates.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I can handle my own. I know the Dance of the Sword. Besides, you said you owe me a favor from that time right?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tai smiled. &ldquo;Indeed I do. If it wasn&rsquo;t for you, I&rsquo;d still be in prison or even executed. I wouldn&rsquo;t have become a captain or general. But a ship full of soldiers is no place for a lady like you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The men will need someone to cook.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re a concubine. For you to do those things&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Former concubine.&rdquo; she replied with a hearty smile. &ldquo;Besides, I am still a woman, aren&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I suppose.&rdquo; Tai no longer objected and finally agreed to let her come on board.</p></p>

<p><p>General Tai&rsquo;s ship, named the <strong>Tai Pei</strong>, was parked in the harbor of the a Shen military base. It is the flagship of the imperial navy, and as such, is larger than all other ships. It is equipped with all functions of a battleship - holes in the bottom row for paddling, cannons on the side, and sails with the symbol of Shen embroidered on them. Its color scheme was gold and red, with the remainder brown for most the ship because it&rsquo;s made of wood.</p></p>

<p><p>The sides of the ship converge at the front with curves, making a sharp point at the front. Celina stood at the sharp point to get the best view of the ocean. No words could describe the excitement she felt at this moment. She felt all the sensations at once - the view of the endless blue and the smell of the sea and the breeze blowing gently against her face.</p></p>

<p><p>A soldier blew the horn, signaling them to leave port. Another soldier cut the ropes that the ship to the port. Once they were cut, the workers in the pit started paddling.</p></p>

<p><p>Tai stood next to her. Her hand was over her forehead and a pleasant smile fell upon her face. She has waited for this moment for a long time.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read all about the sea from books in the imperial library. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to know what it was like out there. The adventures, the excitement. The books have pictures but it&rsquo;s nothing compared to the real thing.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see the real thing soon.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The treasure map was placed on a table and Tai and his men surrounded the table as they examined it.</p></p>

<p><p>Man A: &ldquo;The treasure is located on an unknown island.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Man B: &ldquo;It is south of the kingdom&rsquo;s borders. It&rsquo;s uncharted territory.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tai: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why the southern seas are dangerous. It&rsquo;s rumored to be full of pirate raids. Stay alert.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes sir.&rdquo; All his men saluted Tai.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, a soldier barged into the meeting. &ldquo;General. We have spotted a boat approaching us.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tai put on his helmet and went with his soldier outside. &ldquo;Is it an enemy?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not sure. It&rsquo;s not showing signs of hostility.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s approach cautiously.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hai.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The Tai Pei slowly approached the fisherman&rsquo;s boat. It navigated towards the right, moving in parallel to the fisherman&rsquo;s boat before stopping. The men placed the planks onto the other boat&rsquo;s deck and boarded. The planks were solid pieces of wood that allowed them to cross over. One must be quick and careful while walking, for one wrong move means he will fall into the ocean. These waters were known to have sharks, so falling in the water means a guaranteed death.</p></p>

<p><p>Ten of the navy soldiers boarded the fisherman&rsquo;s boat. They found a group of men in bad condition - many of them were injured and bleeding.</p></p>

<p><p>One man in particular stood out from the crowd. <strong>Captain Ching</strong> has black patch on his right eye and a silver hook instead of a right hand. He also wore a black hat, and he had a black mustache and pointy beard.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Can you help us? I am Ching, the captain of this boat.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Are you fishermen?&rdquo; the soldier asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We are. We were attacked by pirates. Please help us, we have no medical supplies.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The two soldiers glanced at each other in agreement.</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;DS_B&quot;></a>[ B ] - The Man in Golden Armor: Raizo's Grudge</p></p>

<p><p>Consequently, Ching and his twenty men were brought over to the Tai Pei. Celina was watching curiously from the sidelines. Her attention was focused on Ching&rsquo;s unique appearance.</p></p>

<p><p>A navy soldier made the introductions. &ldquo;This Captain Ching. And this is General Tai of the Shen Kingdom.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ching bowed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an honor to meet you, sir.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Tai inquired.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We were attacked by pirates...they called themselves the Black Beards.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tai glanced at him from head to toe. &ldquo;You look like a pirate.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re judging people by appearances. Pirates took my right eye and my hand.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Celina was behind a line of soldiers. She stared like a curious child at the man&rsquo;s hook.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sorry to hear that.&rdquo; said Tai. &ldquo;You and your men can stay on our ship and we&rsquo;ll tend to your wounds. You&rsquo;ll be safe from pirates.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Captain Ching gave a wide smile. &ldquo;Thank you so much sir.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A soldier held the captain by the arm and they walked towards the cabin. Celina stepped in front of them. &ldquo;Hello, I am Lady Ce.&rdquo; Ching was pleasantly surprised that there is a woman on board. She was wearing a white qipao with slits at the thighs and white toeless shoes. Her skin was pale and her face was pretty. Her entire appearance was the mere definition of beauty...she was someone that did not belong on a boat full of navy soldiers...much like a dove in a battlefield. Ching&rsquo;s eye was wide open. Him and his crew has not seen a woman in a long time, and suddenly an attractive woman appears before him, thus he was not prepared for such a welcome surprise.</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;I will tend to your wounds if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Uhhh...I don&rsquo;t mind at all.&rdquo; He did not realize he was blushing.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let me take you to my cabin. I want to hear about your war stories.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Two of the fisherman looked at each other. &ldquo;How come cap&rsquo;n gets the girls?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just how it is, mate.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Celina just finished bandaging Ching&rsquo;s injured arm. The arm that was injured was his right so she sat to his right. &ldquo;Thank you...miss...uhhh...&rdquo;<br>  &ldquo;Lady Ce.&rdquo; she said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Lady Ce.&rdquo; he repeated.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Is it true you were attacked by pirates?&rdquo; she inquired.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. They were cold blooded and ruthless. We&rsquo;re just a bunch of fisherman and merchants and we were unarmed, not that they&rsquo;d care.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read a lot about pirates from books. So what the books say is true.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Have you never been to the open seas?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Celina turned her head. &ldquo;This is my first time. I&rsquo;ve always wondered what it&rsquo;s like to travel to the open seas. It sounds exciting.&rdquo; Then she placed her hand on his forearm, focusing on the hook. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never met a real pirate before.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Uhhh I&rsquo;m not a pirate.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh sorry. I&rsquo;ve never seen a man with a hook before. But I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a story behind it, right?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ching found himself blushing again. &ldquo;Yeah. It wasn&rsquo;t a pleasant one, for sure.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A soldier barged into the room. &ldquo;Sorry for interrupting. Captain Ching, the general requests your presence in the meeting room.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ching stood up. &ldquo;Well my dear, I will be back.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to hear your stories about the sea.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>As Ching and his escort went up the stairs and out to the deck, he had a flashback.</p></p>

<p><p>Captain Ching noticed a ship from his eye glass telescope. &ldquo;An imperial ship is coming our way.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Wuhan: &ldquo;Are we going to attack them, cap&rsquo;n?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tohchen: &ldquo;No way. They are too dangerous for us.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Wuhan: &ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s too dangerous for the Black Beards. We should attack head on.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ching closed his telescope. &ldquo;Imperial ships have a lot of gold and weapons on them. But we&rsquo;re not going to attack head on because they are trained soldiers. You lot are no match for them. We&rsquo;re going to deceive them. Wuhan, cut my arm.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But cap&rsquo;n...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ching grew angry. &ldquo;Grrr just do it you incompetent fool!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Wuhan reluctantly slashed Ching&rsquo;s left arm. &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s my turn.&rdquo; His hook retracted and became a knife. Then he stuck into Wuhan&rsquo;s chest, causing him to scream.</p></p>

<p><p>Unlike his men who are straightforward brutes, Ching is a man of strategy and deception. He was the one who conjured up this plan to deceive the imperials. All his men injured each other to make themselves look like the victims of a pirate raid. He did not use his main ship, the Black Boat, because it would be too obvious. They used a fisherman&rsquo;s boat they recently raided as the bait, giving their story more legitimacy.</p></p>

<p><p>Ching smiled as he imagined his future victory. (These people are so gullible. Taking over this ship will be easy as pie.) Ching was brought to the meeting room. As he laid his eyes on the map his eyes widened. (This map...this is the one Wuhan was supposed to deliver to me. Damn, the imperials took it from him. That means he failed.)</p></p>

<p><p> Tai began the explanation. &ldquo;This is a treasure map we found at the port of Yi Ping. It leads to an unnamed island. Captain Ching you&rsquo;re familiar with these dangerous seas. What&rsquo;s the safest path to get to the island?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ching: &ldquo;We are heading southwest, but you have to go further northwest.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lieutenant: &ldquo;But that path leads us into the fog.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ching: &ldquo;The southwest is full of pirate gangs. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re all strong but you can&rsquo;t handle them all. If you go into the fog at least they can&rsquo;t find you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tai: &ldquo;Very well then. We will head northwest.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>After Ching left the meeting room, the lieutenant wanted to say something. &ldquo;Sir can we really trust them?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tai: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trust anybody, but we&rsquo;ve never been this far down south. These fisherman know this area better than we do. I can&rsquo;t think of a reason why he would purposely lead us into a pirate ambush. They will die too.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lieutenant: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help but shake the feeling they&rsquo;re not fisherman or merchants. They feel like pirates.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tai: &ldquo;In these crimson seas even fisherman have to learn to fight.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Despite defeating a group of bandits, Alex still has a lot of work to do in Yi Ping. There were still more bandit gangs terrorizing the citizens. In the southern part of Yi Ping...</p></p>

<p><p>Alex shook his blade to release the blood. Next to him was Li Cheng who also had much blood on her blade. On the ground lay five bandits who were all bleeding and groaning in pain.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re done here. That&rsquo;s the last one right?&rdquo; said Li.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is the last bandit gang that we know of. But there could be more. Let&rsquo;s return to the palace.&rdquo; said Alex.</p></p>

<p><p>Alex searched for Celina in all the usual places but she was no where to be found. Then he happened to run into Lei, Celina&rsquo;s servant from her concubine days. &ldquo;Lei. Have you seen Lady Ce?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know? That&rsquo;s right, you were away in another city all this time. She went with General Tai on the treasure hunt. I think he called it <strong>Operation Crimson Sea</strong>.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;She with Tai? Didn&rsquo;t the king forbid her to go?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He snuck her on board without telling anyone.&rdquo; Lei replied.</p></p>

<p><p>Alex did a face palm. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe her. Does she want to go sailing that badly? Doesn&rsquo;t she know how dangerous the open seas are?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure my lady is happy that you&rsquo;re worried about her. But rest assured, Demon Slayer, because Tai, I mean, the general is with her. He will keep her safe.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Alex smiled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. I know Tai well. He is trustworthy.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Actually, did you know that Lady Ce and the general have known each other long before they met you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Actually no.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; said Lei, putting her sleeve over her face. &ldquo;Come, let me tell you the story...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ching is back at the cabin, sitting in the same spot, next to Celina. She was touching his arm with both hands as he told her a story from his past. &ldquo;It was a long time ago, yet it felt like yesterday. Me and my crew were on the way back to the port when this pirate ship ambushed us. They came out of no where and suddenly boarded my ship. I didn&rsquo;t know much about fighting but I picked up a sword and learned to use it in a matter of seconds. But it wasn&rsquo;t enough. One of the pirates cut off my hand. Somehow me and my crew survived, whatever was left us. They just wanted our gold.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Celina listened intently without blinking even once. &ldquo;Does it hurt?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;At first it hurt a lot. But not anymore. They found a doctor to patch up my wound.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve had that hook ever since?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Uh yeah. Without the hook it&rsquo;s just a stump. It&rsquo;s no sight for a lady like you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Why did you pick a hook instead of something useful like a knife?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well this thing is quite useful. It helps me put on clothes and eating food.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; she replied with a hearty smile.</p></p>

<p><p>Ching was blushing yet again. In that moment, he decided that he would make this woman his wife. As soon as he takes over this ship, he will claim her as his property.</p></p>

<p><p>Tai was on the front of the ship, staring deep into the mist. Suddenly, he saw a large object come out of the mist, it was another boat. Little did he know, it was Captain Ching&rsquo;s real ship, the Black Boat. Tai put on his war helmet and started alerting his men. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re being approached by pirates! All men gather arms!&rdquo; He ran from the ship&rsquo;s front all the way to the back, yelling the same thing. &ldquo;Gather arms! We&rsquo;re under attack!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The Black Boat went parallel to the Tai Pei and large metal spears penetrated the Tai Pei&rsquo;s side. The pirates put up long wooden bridges so they can cross over. They all raised their swords to the air and screamed their battle cry. All the soldiers who were ready to fight gathered in one place and fought the intruder pirates.</p></p>

<p><p>Inside a cabin, a soldier said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re under attack. Stay put.&rdquo; He turned around and was about to exit. The fisherman drew a knife and stabbed the soldier in the back, effectively killing him.</p></p>

<p><p>Throughout all rooms in the ship, the fisherman snuck up behind the soldiers and either stabbed them or knocked them out.</p></p>

<p><p>Not knowing the odds were against him, Tai fought his best. A pirate charged at him. He brushed his blade aside, leaving him open, and Tai cut him in the chest. Slash. A second pirate came at him with a upward strike. Tai blocked it. *Clang* The general bent his knees and did a spinning strike, cutting the pirate&rsquo;s liver. Slash.</p></p>

<p><p> One of the &ldquo;fisherman&rdquo; was behind him. &ldquo;What&rsquo;re you doing here? Get back to the basement where it&rsquo;s safe.&rdquo; yelled Tai. The &ldquo;fisherman&rdquo; used a bow to hit Tai on the head, knocking him out.</p></p>

<p><p>The rest of the navy were either knocked out by the &ldquo;fishermen&rdquo; or killed by the pirates.</p></p>

<p><p>*Bang bang* Celina gasped. &ldquo;Stay put!&rdquo; She yelled at Ching as she got off the bed and grabbed two swords off the shelf.</p></p>

<p><p>Two pirates broke down the door and entered the small cabin. Celina got into fighting stance.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, something struck her neck and she was paralyzed. Her vision became blurry and her legs lost strength. She took a step forward and dropped her swords and fell on her knees, then landed flat on the floor.</p></p>

<p><p>Ching walked to her side. Celina did not have the time to process the shock. Her vision was blurry and she was losing consciousness.</p></p>

<p><p>Meanwhile, in another part of the sea was the pirate ship called The Grace, which was named by a man named <strong>Raizo</strong>. Much like Liu Cao, he wore golden armor from his shoulders down to his feet. He had light blue hair, also a feature that Liu Cao has. But unlike the king, he is a brute on the inside and out. His hair was long and wavy, not having a haircut in years. He was dark skinned and his face could be said to be ugly, a face that one would associate with violence and crime.</p></p>

<p><p>A parrot flew to Raizo&rsquo;s shoulder with a scroll tied to its feet. He opened the scroll and read the contents. &ldquo;So Captain Ching has taken over an imperial ship. And he has the map that leads to the legendary sword. A job well done.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Pirate: &ldquo;Imperials? How did he manage to defeat them?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Raizo: &ldquo;Unlike you fools, Ching does not attack head on, especially on an imperial ship. He comes up with a plan to defeat the enemy without putting himself in any danger.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Pirate: &ldquo;Sir, what will we do now?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Raizo: &ldquo;We will rendezvous with the Black Boat to get the map.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes sir!&rdquo; All the pirates returned to their posts.</p></p>

<p><p>Raizo stood up from his chair and went inside his cabin. His cabin was a simple one, there was only a bed in the corner and a desk with a mirror. He walked towards the mirror and stared at it for a few seconds. Soon, the mirror&rsquo;s image started to distort and Raizo&rsquo;s face became the face of someone else.</p></p>

<p><p> The image of <strong>Darkstalker</strong> appeared. He was a demon wearing a black hood and a mask. Despite that, his demonic features could clearly be seen - such as his purple skin, long pointy ears, and sharp fangs.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I have good news, Darkstalker. We&rsquo;re going to get the map at last. It will lead us to the legendary Water Sword.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Good. Don&rsquo;t forget about our deal.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Of course. You scratch my back and I scratch yours. You protect me from the shadows while I bring you human souls to consume.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>It was a number of years ago when Raizo met this particular demon. It took place on one of the docks of Yi Ping. Raizo just killed a bunch of troops, creating a line of corpses. More troops arrived, running over the corpses of their colleagues. Raizo cut down a few more of them, but he was getting overwhelmed. He had a wound on his abdomen and he was sweating heavily. Two soldiers held their fighting stance, and upon noticing Raizo&rsquo;s wound, were assured of their victory.</p></p>

<p><p>The first soldier charged and took a swing, and Raizo blocked it, but he fell backwards. The soldier stepped closer to him while he crawled backwards. &ldquo;No wait. I&rsquo;ll give you any reward you want if you let me go!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Soldier: &ldquo;Forget it. The general wants you dead. That&rsquo;s all there is to it.&rdquo; Suddenly, Darkstalker came out of Raizo&rsquo;s shadow, surprising both soldiers. &ldquo;W-What is that?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> Darkstalker spread his arms to the side and threw daggers at them. Some of those daggers hit their faces, chest area, and one hit their necks, killing them on the spot. Raizo was the only one remaining, and he was stunned. The demon proceeded to take out his necklace and absorbed the souls of all the dead soldiers in the area.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Why did you help me?&rdquo; asked Raizo.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Because I have been noticing you...Captain Raizo. I was drawn to your bloodlust...with you around I can consume many souls of the fallen.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been watching me? As in, you could kill me at any time?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I am one that hides in the shadows. I will watch you from the darkness and protect your life. In return you will help me consume human souls.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I see. You demons consume the souls of the fatally wounded and recently dead, heh. And you chose me. I should be honored.&rdquo; Raizo then grunted from his wound. &ldquo;Too bad I&rsquo;m not a captain anymore. From now on it&rsquo;s going to be rough.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You can still be a <strong>captain</strong>, not of the imperials, but of the sea.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Of the sea?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Become a pirate and rule the seas. And gather an army so one day you can get your revenge.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>It was Darkstalker&rsquo;s suggestion that he become a pirate to begin with. It made perfect sense at the time. If he stayed in any of the cities in the kingdom, he&rsquo;d be hunted down day and night. In the river between Shen and Leinwan as well as the open seas there is no police force nor army. In the open seas, merchant ships get raided frequently, thus earning it the nickname the crimson seas. This would be the perfect place for Raizo, a man who honors no rules nor boundaries.</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;TiedToALog&quot;></a>Tied To A Log</p></p>

<p><p>Celina&rsquo;s eyes opened and she blinked a few times before they adjusted to the new surroundings. She just became conscious and found herself tied up to a log. Her hands were behind her back and her ankles were tied as well. One particular pirate was polishing his sword when he noticed she&rsquo;s awake.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You awake at last aye?&rdquo; He walked up to her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who are you? Where am I?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh a talkative one eh?&rdquo; Tohchen grabbed her chin. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a pretty face.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Get your hands off her.&rdquo; said Ching. &ldquo;No one touches her without my permission.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ching and his group of pirates surrounded the tied up Celina. She was surrounded by greedy and perverted pirates, and once again, she finds herself in a compromising situation. These men were all thieves and they do not care about human life. And to them, she is nothing more than a fresh piece of meat.</p></p>

<p><p>They were all laughing and staring at her with their greedy eyes. She was scared, for who knows what they are going to do to her?</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hey captain, let&rsquo;s have some fun with her!&rdquo; said Tohchen.</p></p>

<p><p>All the pirates were yelling and screaming affirmatively. &ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ching grabbed the pirate&rsquo;s hand and removed it from her face. &ldquo;I said don&rsquo;t touch her. I saw her first. You can have her when I say you can have her.&rdquo; Tohchen backed away. &ldquo;Aye, if you say so.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Celina stared at the captain with contempt. &ldquo;You deceived us&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, my dear. That&rsquo;s how it is. Deception is part of my plan.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a coward. I can&rsquo;t believe I trusted you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You wanted to touch my hook. Didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Ching put the hook against her cheek and she turned away. He slowly glided the hook down her cheek while she winced. Then he pinched her cheek. She winced even more. &ldquo;You sure are a fine specimen of a woman.&rdquo; His hook grabbed her chin and made her face him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve decided to make you my wife.&rdquo; He glided the hook to neck and she swallowed hard. The pirates watched in anticipation.</p></p>

<p><p>The hook went to her sternum and the metal felt cold and pointy against her skin. He glided the hook towards her dress&rsquo;s neckline. &ldquo;Besides eating food this hook has other uses. Like this...&rdquo; The hook ripped up the fabric on the shoulder. *Trrrrrr* Celina shrieked and blushed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No! Stop!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The pirates grew excited. <strong>&ldquo;Ohhh...&rdquo;</strong></p></p>

<p><p>He put the hook down to her collar. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to see more of you.&rdquo; He cut the dress, revealing some cleavage.</p></p>

<p><p>Celina gasped in embarrassment and fear. The pirates grew more excited as they watched without blinking.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to see what you look like under the dress.&rdquo; said Ching, smiling. He pointed the hook at her left leg and glided it against her skin. Celina gasped and squirmed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No! Please! Stop!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The hook caught the incision of the dress and cut it vertically, revealing more of her thighs. *Trrrr*</p></p>

<p><p>The pirates started to cheer. &ldquo;Yeah! Cut up her dress!&rdquo; &ldquo;I want to see her naked!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ching bent down and lifted up the flap of her dress. Celina shrieked. He stuck his face between her legs and inside of the flap. Celina squirmed and groaned. &ldquo;Uhhh! No! Not there! Uhhhh! Uhhh! No!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The pirates went ballistic as they enjoyed the show. They cheered and raised their swords in the air.</p></p>

<p><p>Eventually Ching removed his head from that spot.</p></p>

<p><p>Tohchen: &ldquo;We want to have some fun too captain. We fought hard against the imperials.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah captain.&rdquo; shouted Wuhan. &ldquo;We deserve a reward.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ching noticed that his men were roused up and it would be bad to deny them now. &ldquo;Fine, but only for a little bit. None of you can have her until I&rsquo;ve had her first, got it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tohchen stepped in front of Celina and licked his lips. She was scared for her life. She was panting for breath and her eyes were shaking. &ldquo;No... please...no...please!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He placed the blade&rsquo;s tip against her collar. &ldquo;I want to see more of your skin, baby.&rdquo; The blade went down to cut up more of her dress. She shrieked as more of her skin was revealed to these low lives. Then he cut up more pieces of her shoulders. Each time he cut her dress, the pirates cheered.</p></p>

<p><p>Celina was completely helpless. All she could do was plead. &ldquo;Stop, please! Stop it! Please!&rdquo; Tohchen started cutting random places on her dress. Trrr. Trrr. Trrr. &ldquo;Please stop! Please!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Wuhan suddenly shoved Tohchen out of the way. &ldquo;My turn!&rdquo; He pointed the blade at her stomach. He cut up her dress, revealing more of her skin. The pirates continued to cheer.</p></p>

<p><p>Celina as a little girl was playing with a doll. A boy snatched the doll from her. &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; she shrieked. &ldquo;Give it back!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mine!&rdquo; He started to rip the dress off the doll.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Stop that!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This stupid doll doesn&rsquo;t need clothes.&rdquo; He ripped off a piece of the fabric, leaving the doll&rsquo;s top exposed.</p></p>

<p><p>She continued to scream for her dear life. The more her skin was revealed, they more they cheered and the more embarrassed she became. From behind the log, one can see Wuhan cutting her with his sword. *Slish slish* Pieces of white fabric flew to the air. The pirates in the audience were all perverted and stared while drooling. Celina screamed at the top of her lungs as tears streamed down her face. &ldquo;No please please!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Give it back!&rdquo; shouted the little girl.</p></p>

<p><p>The boy shoved her against the wall. &ldquo;Girls don&rsquo;t need clothes.&rdquo; He ripped the entire dress off the doll and tossed it aside. &ldquo;Girls should just be naked all the time. See?&rdquo; The boy brought it to face level and shoved it in her face.</p></p>

<p><p>Even though it&rsquo;s just a toy, the girl thought it was cruel to strip the doll naked. The doll was a representation of a girl and girls need dresses to cover themselves. The doll just looked wrong, it was so bare and exposed.</p></p>

<p><p>Pieces of white fabric flew to the air as the pirate stripped her. The pirates&rsquo; loud noises faded into the background. This was a nightmare scenario for the poor girl. Her life has come to this...the center of a strip show for a bunch of murderers and rapists. Her head faced up and she screamed at the top of her lungs.</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;DS_C&quot;></a>[ C ] - Time is of the Essence: Find the Black Beards</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;HarassInChingsRoom&quot;></a>Harassment In Ching's Room</p></p>

<p><p>Ching came into the bedroom and poured himself a cup of wine and drank it while staring at her features. Celina was laying on his bed, wearing nothing but pink ribbons wrapped around her body. A pillow was placed under her head. Ching finished off his wine without taking his eyes off her for one second.</p></p>

<p><p>He touched her face with his hand, and she turned away. But he did not worry, for he will have her eventually. He kneeled next to the bed and placed the hook on her hand. Celina felt the sharp pointy end on her hand and became afraid. He glided the hook to her wrist and the contents of her arm. He glided it on her forearm and her upper arm, and made its way to her shoulder.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Your skin is so smooth and soft&#8230;&rdquo; He placed the hook on her neck and she swallowed hard. Her breathing became irregular as the hook made a circular trip around her neck. Then he placed the hook on her cheek. She winced and shut her eyes. She could feel the cold, hard metal against her face.</p></p>

<p><p>For some reason, he found a sick pleasure in touching her with the hook. Just because he lost a hand doesn&rsquo;t mean he can&rsquo;t touch a woman&rsquo;s body with the hook.</p></p>

<p><p>He pinched her cheek by pressing the hook into it. &ldquo;You wanted to know about the hook, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; She winced more. The hook went in circles around her face. &ldquo;Today is your lucky day. Heh heh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Two pirates were sneaking to the window, hoping to catch a glimpse of the action inside the captain&rsquo;s room. They know he is having his way with the captive inside, and they are horny enough to want to take a peek. One pirate stood on a barrel while the other was holding it. &ldquo;Do you see anything?&rdquo; asked the barrel holder.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;A little.&rdquo; replied the peeping tom. His eyes were pressed against the window.</p></p>

<p><p>Ching put the hook on her forehead, and Celina closed her eyes, and he could see the fear by her shaking eyes and quivering lips. He moved the hook down to her nose, running it as slow as possible. Celina dreaded every moment of it, it was sheer hell for her. The more she hated it, the more he enjoyed it. The hook went to the tip of her lips and he ran it down her lips, making sure she felt every bit of it.</p></p>

<p><p>Then the hook went to the bottom of her chin and she gasped. &ldquo;Everything in this ship is mine, including you. Every inch of you belongs to me now, understand?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He glided the hook down her neck and her sternum. It went to her cleavage and the top of the ribbons. The hook ripped up two of the ribbons as it went down. She gasped.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, what do you see?&rdquo; asked pirate B.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Quiet down. He might hear you.&rdquo; A whispered.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Damn it, I want to look.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wait your turn.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ching glided his hook down to her obliques and towards the hip. Suddenly he could not control himself anymore and planted his face between her breasts. Celina moaned weakly. &ldquo;Uhhhh, uhhhh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>His right hand squeezed her breast as his face caressed them. He kissed her sternum, and his head was bumping her chin, and she turned away. &ldquo;Uhhh, uhhh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;From the moment I saw you I decided you were going to be my woman.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He kissed her neck all over. &ldquo;Uhhh, uhhh.&rdquo; He kissed her jawline and her cheek.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You wanted to hear stories didn&rsquo;t you? Now you get to be the story. The most exciting story of all!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You lied to me...&rdquo; she said as a tear drop appeared on her eye.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what pirates do.&rdquo; He grabbed her chin. &ldquo;And you wanted to meet a pirate.&rdquo; He forced his lips into hers.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mmmmmmmm! Mmmmmm!&rdquo; Tears drip down her eyes. Her fingers squeezed the bed sheet tightly.</p></p>

<p><p>The peeping tom watched without blinking. He swallowed hard and his hand squeezed the window pane. He was becoming aroused as if he&rsquo;s the one violating the woman.</p></p>

<p><p>Ching kissed her neck and sternum, then her breasts. Then he went down to her stomach and kissed it. She panted for breath as he violated her body parts. But the most exciting part for him is yet to come. His hand touched her thigh and felt it all over. He went from her upper thigh down to her knee and her shin to her ankle, not missing an inch. Then he kissed her upper thigh while his hand caressed the inside of her thigh. She moaned in reaction to his touches.</p></p>

<p><p>He placed the hook on her ankle and glided the tip of it against her calf. Occasionally he&rsquo;d poke her skin with the tip.</p></p>

<p><p>On the deck a pirate was about to fire the cannon. At the butt of the cannon there was a rope that ignites it. He lit the rope with a match and watched it burn up.</p></p>

<p><p> He tantalizingly moved the tip towards her knee. Then he glided the tip to her inner thigh...moving it higher and higher. He did it extremely slowly like a snail, enjoying every passing second.</p></p>

<p><p>The peeping tom&rsquo;s eyes were wide open. He held his breath as he waited for the climatic moment.</p></p>

<p><p>The fire burned half the rope and steadily made its way to the cannon.</p></p>

<p><p>The hook was halfway through her inner thigh...and getting ever closer to her womanhood. Celina&rsquo;s right hand squeezed the bed sheet. She shed tears of fear and winced as she awaited the dreadful moment. Her left hand squeezed the bed sheet as well. The suspense was already torture.</p></p>

<p><p>The peeping tom grew more excited. His throat dried up. He held his breath and his heart was beating rapidly.</p></p>

<p><p>The rope was nearly burnt out...</p></p>

<p><p>The hook was an inch away from the ribbons. It slowly went inside the ribbons...Celina shut her eyes and her face was a grimace. Tear drops drip down her cheeks. The hook went closer...and closer...until...</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The cannon fired. *Kaboom*</p></p>

<p><p>Her scream came as a surprise, and the peeper lost his footing, as the ledge he was standing on broke, and he fell on top of his comrade. Luckily, they were not heard, as their crashing sounds were overshadowed by her scream. Quickly, they ran away, fearing they may be discovered.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;AAAAAHHHHH!&rdquo; Her eyes were wide open as she screamed at the top of her lungs. Her head titled backwards and tears streamed endlessly down her cheeks. Her fingers on both hands squeezed the bed sheet, crumbling it into a ball inside her fingers.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What the hell?&rdquo; Yu exclaimed as he read the scroll. &ldquo;The Tai Pei has been attacked and the general and ambassador has been taken hostage?&rdquo; He slammed his palm on the table. &ldquo;We had a battleship full of soldiers, led by a capable general. How did they screw up so badly? These pirates are more cunning than I thought.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> Lord Yu immediately set off to look for the Demon Slayer in the palace. He sent all his servants to find Alex, and as soon as he was found, he was asked to go to Lord Yu&rsquo;s room.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What the hell?!&rdquo; said Alex.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I said too.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;A bunch of mere pirates, who are no different than bandits, defeated a capable fighter like Shu Tai? And Celina&rsquo;s...no Lady Ce&rsquo;s Dance of the Sword was defeated? Who is their leader?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But most likely the ones who did this are the Black Beards. We can&rsquo;t underestimate them. That&rsquo;s why I want you on this mission. I know you want to save Lady Ce at all costs.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;All I need is a boat and I will head out immediately.&rdquo; said Alex.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How many men do you need?&rdquo; asked Yu.</p></p>

<p><p>Alex shook his head. &ldquo;None. I will handle it alone.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Alone? That&rsquo;s nuts even for you!&rdquo; the eunuch exclaimed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I will go with my sister, Li Cheng. I don&rsquo;t need an army, we can sneak around better that way.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Still, I feel anxious about sending you two to your deaths.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care how strong the Black Beards are. I have the Fire Sword and my sister has the Ice Sword. Don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p> <p>Alex and Li go to the port of Yi Ping. they are able to board a passenger ship</p></p>

<p> <p><a name=&quot;HarassByTheCrew&quot;></a>Harassment By The Crew</p></p>

<p><p>While their captain was sleeping, one pirate snuck into the bedroom. Celina was asleep on the bed, still tied up like before. The pirate walked closer to her and smiled wickedly. She woke up and was about to scream, and he put his hand on her mouth. She squirmed left and right. &ldquo;MMFF! MFFF!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Before she knew what happened, she was thrown into another room, where there were many other pirates. They were all drinking and having a party. Celina was scared even more than before, as they were looking at her. She was the only woman in the room, she was unprotected, and there was only one thing on their minds.</p></p>

<p><p>Two pirates grabbed her by the arms, lifting her up, and slammed her on the table. Wham! They were all laughing at her and it was indeed a nightmare come true.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, no!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Her arms were being held by two men, and there was no way to get free. The rest of her body could move but it did not help. One of them came up to her with a bottle of wine.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please, no!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He shoved the bottle onto her lips, and grabbed her chin, forcing her to drink the wine. Everyone laughed and yelled as he forced all the alcohol down her throat. She resisted, but it was no use. While struggling, the wine spilled all over her chin and neck, and her breasts.</p></p>

<p><p>She was already feeling the effects of the wine. She grew dizzy, her vision was distorted, and the pirates&rsquo; laughter became background noise. She did not know if this was a nightmare or not, but the pain was real. Nightmares usually end and she&rsquo;ll wake up, but this never ends. It will last an eternity.</p></p>

<p><p>They tied up her wrists to the table legs. They also tied up her ankles. All four limbs were tied and unable to move. She is at their complete mercy. One of them grabbed her breasts, even though there were ribbons, it was as if they were not there. He felt them all over, and he licked them.</p></p>

<p><p>Another pirate was feeling up her thighs, touching them with his filthy hands, and kissing them with his lips.</p></p>

<p><p>What Ching did to her was nothing compared to this. She was being violated by more than one man, being touched and violated all over. Never in her life did she even imagine something like this could happen. This is indeed a nightmare scenario she must face.</p></p>

<p><p>Ching barged into the room, and he could not believe what he was seeing. Celina was being harassed by his men. Her wrists were tied up by piece of rope connected to the ceiling. She was standing up, with her arms raised, and her wrists tied together.</p></p>

<p><p>One of the pirates was pulling the ribbon around her hips, laughing as he did. He pulled the ribbon to reveal more of her legs, and she was spinning as he pulled. She was shrieking and screaming while he exposed more of her lower half.</p></p>

<p><p>Three pirates were watching in the corner, enjoying the show. They were whistling and yelling loudly, encouraging the man continue what he was doing.</p></p>

<p><p>As for poor Celina, her arms have been raised the entire time, and they were tired. But being tired was the least of her problems.</p></p>

<p><p>Ching: &ldquo;What do you think you&rsquo;re doing? I thought I made it clear that no one is to touch her?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A: &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, captain, we captured her fair and square. You have to share the reward sometimes.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ching: &ldquo;You will do as you are told, understood?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A: &ldquo;You should lighten, captain.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>B &ldquo;Yeah, lighten up, will ya?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Lighten up? We are about to meet with Lord Raizo.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Everyone reacted to that name with fear. &ldquo;Lord Raizo is coming?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ching: &ldquo;Yes. If he finds out you are slacking off, you are going to get it! Now get back to work.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>All the pirates answered in the affirmative and they left the room.</p></p>

<p><p>Finally, Celina has a few seconds of relief, but she is not off the hook yet. Ching walked over to her. He grabbed the ribbon on her legs and pulled it, pretty much taking over where his subordinates left off. No, this woman does not belong to his men. He is the captain and he is entitled to everything.</p></p>

<p><p>As for poor Celina, she never gets a break. She&rsquo;s tortured day and night, and now, it starts all over again.</p></p>

<p><p>Will the imperials find her, or is she doomed to be their slave forever?</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;HarassOnTheDeck&quot;></a>Harassment On The Deck</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, no!!&rdquo; Celina screamed as she struggled against the pirate. He held her arms, and pushed her onto the table. Her struggling was useless, as he was physically stronger than she was, and he enjoyed the process.</p></p>

<p><p>He grabbed a bottle of wine nearby. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s drink and have a good time, eh, babe?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh!!&rdquo; she groaned. He grabbed her by the neck, while her hands grabbed his arm.</p></p>

<p><p>Then he shoved the bottle into her mouth, forcing the liquid down her throat. She turned her head left and right to avoid it, but his hand grabbed her chin to stop her from moving. The pirate smiled as she shoved the bottle to her lips, and the liquid spilled into her mouth. Most of the wine fell off her face, but she swallowed some of it.</p></p>

<p><p>It tasted terrible to her, something that is ten times worse than the bitterest medicine she had ever tasted. Celina could not imagine herself being drunk, it is taboo for a good natured person like her.</p></p>

<p><p>She pushed the bottle away from his hand, and it fell on the floor, and she shoved the pirate away. As she stood on her feet, she realized that her coordination was off, as the liquor had already taken effect. She stuttered towards the door, opened it, and went outside. She was expecting the pirate to be right behind her, ready to grab her.</p></p>

<p><p>She continued to stutter to the fence, and leaned against it. The liquor she swallowed gave her a sick feeling. She had a massive headache, and she thought that her head would explode at any moment. Her chest felt extremely uncomfortable, as if her heart would implode upon itself. The wind felt uncomfortable, and only added to her discomfort.</p></p>

<p><p>Leaning forward over the fence, Celina felt like throwing up. Her body cannot handle any alcohol whatsoever, and this feeling was extremely displeasing. Her throat felt like regurgitating something, yet nothing would come out. She put her hand over her mouth.</p></p>

<p><p>As she was suffering, a pirate was watching her curiously. That woman cannot see him at all, and he thought it&rsquo;d be an opportune time to take advantage of her. He had a wicked smile on his lips as he approached her.</p></p>

<p><p>As Celina panted for breath, the pirate grabbed her from behind and she gasped. He smothered his face on her back, kissing and biting her shoulders. Then he pulled her up and shoved her on the floor. *Thud*</p></p>

<p><p>The pirate shoved his face between her breasts while she groaned in agony. Not only was she suffering on the inside, but now she must suffer while being violated by this pervert. Poor Celina cannot even have a moment to herself&#8230;as she is a prisoner on this pirate ship.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, she felt the need to throw up. The pirate forced his lips upon hers, and the pain got her by surprise. There was nothing she could do&#8230;but continue to suffer in this hell.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Look, it&rsquo;s the Tai Pei!&rdquo; Li exclaimed. Alex&rsquo;s rowboat has finally made it to the Tai Pei. They climb atop using a rope hanging by the side. They reached the deck and saw two pirates on the opposite end.</p></p>

<p><p>One of the pirates yawned. His companion touched him on the shoulder, telling him to turn to the side. Upon seeing intruders, they quickly drew their swords and fight. Alex&rsquo;s Fire Sword was set aflame and he slashed them. They were cut on the torso with a burning sensation to make it more painful. <strong>&ldquo;Uuuuuuugh!&rdquo; </strong></p></p>

<p><p>The two pirates were defeated within seconds and they were on their knees. Li was standing behind them.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; Alex asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know...&rdquo; said the pirate.</p></p>

<p><p>Alex grunted. &ldquo;Grrrr. I don&rsquo;t have time for games.&rdquo; His Fire Sword turned red and was set aflame. The pirates trembled.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What kind of sorcery is that?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not sorcery. That&rsquo;s the Fire Sword...one of the four ultimate weapons in this world!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You can tell me what I need to know or I can cut you limb from limb. You&rsquo;re not going to like it, I promise.&rdquo; Usually Alex is more forgiving and calm, but when Celina is involved, he loses all reason and forgiveness. He meant every word he said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Ching has the hostages - one man and one woman. He has the map and they are on the Black Boat!&rdquo; said the pirate.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Captain Ching?&rdquo; Li asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s our captain, the one who gave us the orders to attack the Tai Pei. And he has the treasure map!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So where are they headed?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an island that&rsquo;s on the map.&rdquo; replied the pirate. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s suicide to go there. Pirates and natives in that area call it the island of the dead. It is said that if you set foot on the island you will see the dead come back to life...and you will not leave alive. It is truly terrifying.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>As soon as he told them everything, Li knocked them both unconscious. &ldquo;By the time they wake up, the imperials will be here and arrest them.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So...the island of the dead? What do you think?&rdquo; Alex asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a bunch of crap made up by townsfolk to discourage people from entering the island. Clearly there is something hidden there. Something valuable.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Like the Water Sword. This island gives me a bad feeling.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh? My brother has slain demons but is afraid of ghosts? We need to go save your beloved woman, right?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Raizo&rsquo;s flagship, <strong>The Grace</strong> entered the vision of the Black Boat&rsquo;s passengers and they proceeded to board The Grace. Tai&rsquo;s arms were tied up with two loops of ropes and one loop around the wrists. Celina was back to wearing the white qipao, as there was backup of her dress in her cabin. She was tied up in the same way as Tai. The prisoners were led to an open area on the deck. Upon seeing the man in golden armor, the prisoners were forced to kneel.</p></p>

<p><p>Tai&rsquo;s eyes grew wide open in shock. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Raizo was sitting on a wooden chair, holding the sword upside down between his legs. He was clad in <strong>golden armor</strong> shining like the sun, and his hair has grown longer, but there was no mistaking it. This man with blue hair, the face of a brute, the eyes of a predator...this is absolutely the same Raizo that Tai knew from his early days in the military.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh. It&rsquo;s been a while, Captain Tai. Or should I call you General Tai? You&rsquo;ve done well for yourself these few years.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You know him?&rdquo; asked Celina.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Raizo and I joined the imperial army at the same time and we both got promoted to captain at the same time. However, Raizo engaged excessively in violent behavior, torturing prisoners without permission as well as murdering people without being asked to. You&rsquo;d constantly disobey orders from superiors and General Chung finally got fed up with you. You finally got what you deserved and was exiled from the city, no, the entire kingdom. You&rsquo;re just a barbarian wearing a soldier&rsquo;s uniform.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Raizo formed a <strong>smile with his wide open mouth</strong>, revealing all his teeth. &ldquo;Heh. Such harsh words. Aren&rsquo;t you the same, general? You were caught stealing from the treasure room and was about to be executed, if I recall.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, that happened. But I am nothing like you. Since that incident I have changed. I was given a second chance because I was pardoned.&rdquo; Then he and Celina glanced at each other.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s this woman?&rdquo; asked Raizo.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;A woman who happened to be on the Tai Pei.&rdquo; said Ching.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let her answer for herself!&rdquo; Raizo shouted.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I am...the ambassador of the kingdom.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Raizo: &ldquo;An ambassador going on a treasure hunt? Don&rsquo;t lie to me. Hmph. It doesn&rsquo;t matter. You&rsquo;re prisoners who can&rsquo;t do a thing.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tai: &ldquo;So this is what you&rsquo;ve been doing after your exile? Becoming the captain of pirates because you can&rsquo;t be a real captain?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I have the treasure map, which has the location of the Water Sword. After I obtain it, I will have the ultimate power. Then I will get back to Shen and get my revenge on General Chung and Liu Bei. I&rsquo;ve waited a long time for this chance.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You really are out of date, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Tai commented.</p></p>

<p><p>Raizo: &ldquo;In the open seas there is no way to get information from the capital.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tai: &ldquo;General Chung is dead...and so is Liu Bei.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Huh? So who is the king now?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tai: &ldquo;Liu Cao.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Raizo burst out laughing. &ldquo;Ha ha ha ha! Liu Cao, the kid who abandoned his home to go to the west? He&rsquo;s the one that killed Liu Bei?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tai: &ldquo;No Liu Cao did not kill him...a lot of things have happened. But Liu Cao is the legitimate king now.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Raizo: &ldquo;Heh, no matter. After I get the Water Sword, I will be recognized as the strongest swordsman that ever lived. I will get my revenge on the entire Liu family for my banishment. And I will claim the throne. And the kingdom will be mine!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Celina: &ldquo;You are mad!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tai: &ldquo;Actually, his true name is Liu Raizen...distant relative of Liu Cao. Very distant.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Celina was shocked. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a Liu family member?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tai: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s nothing like the rest of his family. Instead of living the life of a noble, he wanted to join the military. His violent actions were overlooked because of his name. But one day General Chung had enough. He went to Liu Bei in secret and implored him to do something about Raizo. Once he had the king&rsquo;s approval, there was nothing anyone can do. His exile was official and permanent.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Raizo: &ldquo;There you have it. As a member of the Liu&rsquo;s the throne is my birthright. Liu Cao is merely warming up the king&rsquo;s seat for me. The Water Sword is the creation of Sha&rsquo;Uri, the only student of the legendary blacksmith Cho&rsquo;Ann. After I claim it, I will take the throne with <strong>Heaven&rsquo;s Eye</strong>. You two will be key witnesses in my rise to power. Take them away.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The pirates grabbed Tai and Celina and took them to the cell.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about this.&rdquo; said Tai in a grim tone of voice.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your fault.&rdquo; Celina replied. &ldquo;I was the one who insisted on coming to this trip.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;And I was the one who let you onboard.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Celina let out a chuckle. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re both trouble makers, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Seems so.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Do you think&#8230;they are going to kill us?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Not yet, I don&rsquo;t think.&rdquo; replied the general. &ldquo;Raizo still wants to prove something, and we are going to be key witnesses when he rises to power. He thinks that by taking the Water Sword, he will be the strongest warrior in the world. What foolish thinking that is. But enough about him. We need to figure out a way to escape.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Do you have a plan?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We are still on the ship, so escape is impossible. Once we get to the island, I&rsquo;ll figure something out. In the meantime, just rest.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>While still tied up, Tai was brought to Ching&rsquo;s quarters. The pirate shoved Tai on the floor, forcing him to kneel. &ldquo;Good. You may leave us.&rdquo; The pirate henchmen left the room, shutting the door behind him. Then Ching focused on his prisoner. &ldquo;Ah please excuse the harsh treatment, general. You are our prisoner, after all.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; Tai asked hostilely.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It is not about what I want, but rather what Capt&rsquo;n Raizo wants. He told me to keep you and that woman alive. So I understand that you used to know Capt&rsquo;n Raizo?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tai turned to the side. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say I <strong>know</strong> him. We just happened to be in the army together. Sometimes we&rsquo;d bump into each other during missions.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh. I brought you here to give you some advice. Don&rsquo;t try to escape.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tai looked up at him. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t planning to-&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I can always tell if another man is planning to escape. It&rsquo;s in their eyes.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The general just stared at him dumbfounded. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have a chance. The seas are filled with sharks. Jumping overboard means suicide. You&rsquo;re only being kept alive because you&rsquo;re still useful.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Do you intend to keep us as servants?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh no. You&rsquo;re much more useful than that. Power lies where people think power resides. If we spread the word about Raizo&rsquo;s power it won&rsquo;t mean a thing, since we&rsquo;re pirates. Who would listen to us? But if the general and ambassador of the kingdom were to spread the word, your word has more credibility. Isn&rsquo;t that right?&rdquo; Ching flashed a big grin.</p></p>

<p><p>The general was sweating. He thought of Ching as a mere pirate, but that was his mistake. Ching is a mastermind who came up with the plan to pretend to be fisherman attacked by pirates. They boarded the Tai Pei to gain Tai&rsquo;s trust and then backstabbed them. This man is cunning, deceptive and dangerous.</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;DS_D&quot;></a>[ D ] - The Island of Demons</p></p>

<p><p>After analyzing the map, one of the Royal Armada became shocked. &ldquo;It says the treasure is located on <strong>that</strong> island?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard rumors about that unnamed island. People who live in the nearby islands call it demon island because it&rsquo;s full of demons. No one who&rsquo;s ever set foot there comes out alive!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Raizo was indifferent to the pirate&rsquo;s fear. &ldquo;Huh? So what if there are demons? We have a crew of fighters that I personally trained.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We were trained to raid other ships...of people. But we don&rsquo;t know how to fight demons!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Raizo drew his sword and pointed it at the pirate. &ldquo;I have no need for cowards on my ship!&rdquo; The pirate backed away all the way to the very edge of the ship. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want to go that&rsquo;s fine. You can swim home.&rdquo; Then he glanced at his crew. &ldquo;This goes for anyone else who wants to avoid demon island. You can turn back and go home and suck on your mommy&rsquo;s tits.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Thus, that is how Liu Raizo runs the Royal Armada. In the crimson seas, the captains are said to be kings of their own ships and Raizo is no different. In fact, he may be worse than all other pirate captains. Once he decides something, no one can change his mind. Those who show cowardice are thrown overboard and become food for the sharks.</p></p>

<p><p>The Grace has reached the island they were seeking and parked a few feet from land. The entire group left the ship - this includes Raizo and his entire crew, along with Ching and his entire crew and their two prisoners.</p></p>

<p><p>The group traversed through a thick jungle in the sweltering heat. Raizo was still wearing the golden armor he always wore and he was not bothered one bit, unlike the rest of his crew.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, one of the pirates at the back of the group heard a rustling sound. &ldquo;Did you hear that?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hear what?&rdquo; asked his companion.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something watching us!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just your imagination. Keep walking.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, a <strong>creature</strong> emerged from the bushes. It was the size of a normal human, with dark blue skin and fang like teeth. It hissed at its victim. The fearful pirate turned around and screamed as the demon bit his neck, ending his life quickly. His companion also screamed and slashed at the demon, but it grabbed his blade with one hand, and scratched him with its other hand. <strong>*Schleb*</strong> He was fatally stabbed in the chest and fell to his demise.</p></p>

<p><p>Everyone in the large group heard their screams and became alert. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s demons! I knew it!&rdquo; yelled one of the pirates.</p></p>

<p><p>Sure enough, a group of demons appeared from the thick trees. These demons were human-sized and came in a variety of shapes and colors. Since their group was a large one, they were vulnerable to attack from many angles. Celina and Tai were tied up by rope so they were even more afraid than their captors were.</p></p>

<p><p>Raizo, as expected, was not afraid, but rather annoyed. This will delay him in getting the Water Sword and fulfilling his destiny. The pirates at the front of the group charged at the demons and fought. *Slish* A pirate killed a <strong>werewolf</strong>. Another pirate finished off a <strong>red vampire</strong>. *Slash* A pirate just killed off a <strong>tiger</strong>. But there were more demons behind the first wave, and the pirates became overwhelmed and were slaughtered.</p></p>

<p><p>One of the pirates near Raizo screamed and charged into the horde of bloodthirsty demons. He stabbed his sword into one&rsquo;s chest, only to be bitten by another demon, and soon he was surrounded by demons and they were biting and clawing at his flesh.</p></p>

<p><p>The pirates witnessed their friend&rsquo;s demise and started to panic. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t panic!&rdquo; shouted Raizo. &ldquo;We can beat them if we fight together.&rdquo; He charged into the crowd of demons, hacking and slashing, blood splattered all over his armor and face. He hoped this will set the example for his men. Just as he hoped, his men charged after him, crying their battle cries and began murdering the demons.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Release us so we can fight too.&rdquo; Tai said to the two captors.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No way.&rdquo; said the pirate.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all going to die here! We deserve a chance to fight.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Celina and the pirates watched in horror as the demons devoured a pirate&rsquo;s corpse.</p></p>

<p><p>The pirates continued their fight against the front lines of demons, led by Raizo in the front. He kept hacking away and more blood splattered on his face and golden armor. He was not afraid in the least, because he is a man of violence, and he was actually smiling each time he made a kill.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is endless! They keep coming!&rdquo; said a scared pirate.</p></p>

<p><p>A werewolf leapt at him and bit him on the shoulder. The pirate stabbed through the werewolf. Other demons came from the side and attacked him. His sword was stuck and the demon&rsquo;s fangs were still stuck in his shoulder so he could not move. The demons bit him and he died a horrendous death.</p></p>

<p><p>Two pirates panicked and they ran away from the group. &ldquo;Come back here cowards!&rdquo; shouted Raizo. &ldquo;Blast it. Am I surrounded by useless fools?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Darkstalker came out of Raizo&rsquo;s shadow. The pirates near him gasped. &ldquo;Relax. He&rsquo;s on our side.&rdquo; Raizo announced.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Do you see that?&rdquo; Tai said to Celina. &ldquo;That demon came out of Raizo&rsquo;s shadow.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darkstalker opened his robe, revealing many hidden daggers underneath. He leapt to the air and threw those daggers, killing many demons with one move. Raizo and the pirates yelled their battle cry and charged at the demons, slaughtering many. Even Ching, despite being a one-handed swordsman, killed a few demons.</p></p>

<p><p>With Darkstalker&rsquo;s help, the pirate group managed to defeat all the demons in the area, although they lost a third of their members.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Thank you my friend.&rdquo; said the man in golden armor.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No need for thanks.&rdquo; Darkstalker replied. &ldquo;I made a pact with you. I am not going to let some lowly demons kill you. Now then...&rdquo; He walked over Raizo&rsquo;s shadow and sank into it, disappearing completely. The pirates were dumbfounded, not sure to make of this sorcerer. But they were thankful to be alive and didn&rsquo;t bother asking questions.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You see that? That demon works for Raizo.&rdquo; said Tai.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Or is it the other way around?&rdquo; asked Celina. &ldquo;Is Raizo his disciple? Doesn&rsquo;t that make him a demon?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But they remind me of Liu Zhang and Chu Yen and that&rsquo;s not good.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Raizo and Ching&rsquo;s group reached the cave and went inside of it. Occasionally, a demon would jump out of the darkness and attack but it would get killed instantly. Other than that, the group made safely deep into the cave. At last, they reached the chamber they were seeking. Placed in the cave&rsquo;s wall was a niche that contained a sword inside its sheath.</p></p>

<p><p>Ching went over to hold the enclosed sword and walked over to Raizo to hand it to him. Raizo took the enclosed sword and let it sit there for a moment. He did everything slowly and deliberately because this was his moment of triumph and he wanted to savor every bit of it. He pulled out the sword from its sheath slowly. *Schhhhlling*</p></p>

<p><p>Everyone&rsquo;s eyes glittered as they stared in awe. The blade&rsquo;s color was a metallic gray with Chinese words engraved on it - <strong>&#27700;&#21073; </strong>- meaning Water Sword. Raizo glided two fingers from the bottom of the blade to the tip. Then he raised the sword up vertically so everyone can marvel at its legendary power. Two beams of light flared from the blade&rsquo;s reflection.</p></p>

<p><p>Raizo wanted to test its abilities. By putting his chi into the sword, the surrounded water started to gather and flew towards the Water Sword in a circular pattern. All the streams of water were controlled down to the drop, the streams made circles around the blade. Everyone was too shocked to utter a word and continued to watch in awe. Raizo then swings the blade down, and all the streams became water droplets and fell to the ground.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is the real thing. The legendary weapon is mine at last. But first, I need to test it&rsquo;s true abilities. Release them.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The pirates shoved Celina and Tai, causing them to fall on their knees. Then they cut the ropes freeing their wrists.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Give them weapons.&rdquo; Raizo ordered. The pirates tossed two swords in front of them. &ldquo;I want to fight you at your best.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Celina spoke up. &ldquo;I usually use two swords.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ohhh a two handed user, eh?&rdquo; Raizo nodded at his henchmen, who handed Celina a second sword. Celina picked up the two blades as Tai picked up his and they stood up. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hold back even one bit.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Celina and Tai glanced at each other briefly. Their eyes communicated the same message - aim to kill Raizo. They both look forward and waited for golden moment. Ching and all the pirates stared in suspense, not knowing how the result will turn out.</p></p>

<p><p>Both the heroes screamed and charged forward. &ldquo;Yaaaaah!&rdquo; Each step they took splashed water on their ankles. *Splish splash* The Water Sword gathered streams of water around itself as Raizo drew the blade back. &ldquo;Yaaaaaah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>As the two got within distance, Raizo swings his blade diagonally and yelled <strong>&ldquo;Water Slicer!&rdquo;</strong></p></p>

<p><p>A wave of highly concentrated water hit Celina and Tai so hard that their bodies were flipped upside down. Their blades fell onto the pool, as did their bodies. *Splat splat* Their eyes were shut and they grunted in agony.</p></p>

<p><p>Ching and the pirates nearly dropped their jaws as they marvel at the legendary weapon&rsquo;s power. Raizo was extremely pleased with the results, as one can tell by the look in his face. &ldquo;This is the real deal. With the Water Sword now mine, I can finally get my revenge on the Liu family. Ahahahahaha! Ha ha ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>alex and li find the grace and the black boat</p></p>

<p><p>two pirates saw them and attack</p></p>

<p><p>they kill the pirates.</p></p>

<p><p>As Alex and Li walked through the thick jungle, Li felt very uncomfortable the whole time. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; he asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re being followed. I can sense it.&rdquo; Li is a ninja master and as a result, can sense movements from far away.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I can sense it too.&rdquo; Alex replied.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ohhh. I&rsquo;m impressed. You&rsquo;re getting better.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Something bristled in the bushes and the two became alert. To their surprise, it was not pirates, but demons that appeared. And it was not just a few, but many, and they found themselves surrounded.</p></p>

<p><p>Alex and Li stood back to back. &ldquo;So, want to see who kills more demons?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh. A competition? That&rsquo;s only if I don&rsquo;t kill them all myself.&rdquo; Li smiled. It is one of the few times she ever smiled, but that is because she is having fun. Alex felt the same way. Despite their situation, which is being surrounded by violent demons, they were both confident in their abilities. With the ultimate weapons at their disposal, an army of demons is nothing to them.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Fine, you start.&rdquo; said Alex.</p></p>

<p><p>Li&rsquo;s sword started to glow and charge up with energy. She used <strong>Ice Blizzard</strong>, and instantly destroyed everything in its path. Whatever demons were not killed were frozen completely or partially. Now it was Alex&rsquo;s turn. His blade glowed red and became lit on fire. He used the <strong>Heat Wave</strong>, consequently killing all the frozen demons, as well as many others. The remaining demons that were slightly more intelligent decided to retreat.</p></p>

<p><p>In no time at all, the duo reached the cave that contained the Water Sword. Several pirates were stationed by Ching to keep guard. Alex and Li defeated those pirates with ease. Before long, the ground was piled with the bodies of their defeated foes.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That was too easy, compared to the demons these guys are nothing.&rdquo; said Li. &ldquo;Do you think Ching will be this easy?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. He managed to defeat all the imperials and General Tai.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Li&rsquo;s sharp senses picked up something unusual. &ldquo;Alex, you go ahead.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. Go.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Alex turned around and ran down the dark hallway.</p></p>

<p><p>Now Li was alone, standing in the middle of a bunch of corpses. &ldquo;Who are you? I know you&rsquo;re here. Come out!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darkstalker came out of a pirate&rsquo;s shadow. &ldquo;Ohhh you can sense me? Impressive. Who are you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I am called Fo Long.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I am Darkstalker. Prepare to say farewell.&rdquo; The demon opened his cloak and snatched some daggers and threw three of them with one hand and threw three with the other hand. Li blocked the daggers using a circle swipe. The demon sank into a pirate&rsquo;s shadow and disappeared completely.</p></p>

<p><p>Li was taken aback. (He can hide in shadows? This is nuts!) Her eyes darted left and right, searching desperately for her enemy. She her body turned in a full circle, making sure she is not taken by surprise. Even though her mind is sharp and her senses are sharp, there is no way she can detect him. Sweat drops appeared on her forehead and her heart rate increased.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Darkstalker came out of a shadow and jumped to the air and tossed daggers forward. Li used the Ice Blizzard, which destroyed the daggers and hit Darkstalker. The demon landed and was taken aback. His cape had icicles on it.</p></p>

<p><p> Darkstalker&rsquo;s eyes opened wide. &ldquo;You have the Ice Sword? Who are you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s none of your concern.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I must inform the captain about this.&rdquo; He sank into another&rsquo;s shadow and his presence disappeared.</p></p>

<p><p>Alex has reached a large empty room, and in the middle of it stood a man wearing a hat. The man turned around to face Alex. He had an eye patch, a hook on his right hand, and a black beard. &ldquo;You must be Captain Ching?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Right you are. Who&rsquo;re you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I am Alex Cheng, the Demon Slayer.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Never heard of ya. You&rsquo;re a demon slayer, eh? But judgin&rsquo; by the fact that you&rsquo;re on this island means you survived fightin&rsquo; an army of demons.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; Alex wanted to get to the point as he is in no mood to chit chat.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh, you don&rsquo;t come in here askin&rsquo; questions. You&rsquo;ll havta beat me first.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;With pleasure!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Alex dashed forward and attacked aggressively, swinging his blade with perfect precision and speed. Ching was a one handed user, but he practically fights for a living, so he defended himself well. *Clang clang* Within a few strokes, Ching found himself losing ground and stepping back. Alex&rsquo;s Heaven&rsquo;s Wrath Style was overwhelming him.</p></p>

<p><p>*Clang* Ching blocked another one of Alex&rsquo;s attacks and they were in a power lock. But this was a distraction. Alex kicked him in the chest, knocking him to the ground. Immediately, he stood back up. Alex charged him and used Heaven&rsquo;s Retribution, and Ching blocked it just in time. Ching pushed his blade hard, gaining some distance between them. (How can this be? I am not able to do a thing to him? His skill level is too high! At this rate, I&rsquo;ll...I need a plan.)</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let me ask you again. Where is she? Where is Lady Ce?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You came for her? The ambassador woman?&rdquo; Suddenly, Ching realized something important he missed.</p></p>

<p><p>He glided his hook along her cheek while she winced. A tear drop escaped her eye. &ldquo;Alex...&rdquo; she murmured.</p></p>

<p><p>Indeed, those two are lovers. That is why she cried out his name while she was violated. Alex kept asking for his woman and fought with anger in his eyes. A smirk came across Ching&rsquo;s face as he can use this to his advantage.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ohhhh you must care a lot about this woman. Yes...that&rsquo;s why she was crying out your name. Heh heh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The expression on Alex&rsquo;s face changed from anger to something else.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a fine woman, isn&rsquo;t she? I would know as I&rsquo;ve seen her skin. Heh heh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;See this hook? It has touched every inch of her body. Every...single...inch.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Not only does she look good, but she smells good too.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I said stop it !&rdquo; His Fire Sword began to glow red in reaction to his rage. Seconds later it was set a flame.</p></p>

<p><p>Ching&rsquo;s eyes grew wide open. &ldquo;What sorcery is this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Alex dashed forward and struck angrily. Ching defended while retreating. With his enemy&rsquo;s sword set aflame, it became more dangerous for him, as he could be burned from a distance. However, with Alex losing his cool, he became predictable. Ching was able to evade his heavy swings. *Whoosh whoosh* Alex was about to make a heavy strike, Ching knocked his blade to the side, leaving his left side open. Ching side stepped and slashed Alex on his left arm. *Slish*</p></p>

<p><p>The hero stepped back and grunted from his wound. (Is he trying to get me angry to throw me off? I have to calm down.)</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, boy?&rdquo; the pirate taunted. &ldquo;Is that all you&rsquo;ve got?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;One thing is for sure. I will never forgive you.&rdquo; Alex stood in fighting stance, as well as Ching.</p></p>

<p><p>Alex took a step forward with his left foot and swings his blade, creating a wave of fire. This is his signature move, the <strong>Heat Wave</strong>. Ching put his blade over his face as the fire burned him. *Froom* The clothes on his lower chest and left arm were burnt and smoking. (I had no idea he has such a dangerous ability. His Fire Sword is just like Raizo&rsquo;s Water Sword. Is there no way I can beat him?)</p></p>

<p><p>Alex put his blade by his hip and walked forward in a calm manner. This startled the pirate.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Gahhh...this can&rsquo;t be happening!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The Demon Slayer once again used <strong>Heat Wave</strong>. *Froom* Ching&rsquo;s sword heated up and became too hot for his hand so he dropped it. The rest of the flames hit his body, essentially knocking him to the ground. His black coat had several holes in it and his skin was burned.</p></p>

<p><p>Alex walked triumphantly over to his fallen foe. Ching was already on his knees and he got on his palms. &ldquo;No wait! Have mercy! Spare my life, please! I was only following Raizo&rsquo;s orders! He said he was going to kill me if I didn&rsquo;t kill you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This fight is over. Just stay here and wait for the imperials to put you in prison. I have a feeling you&rsquo;ll never set foot on a ship again.&rdquo; Alex turned away, allowing his back to face him.</p></p>

<p><p>Ching smirked and his hook retracted and became a knife. He stood up and ran towards him. Alex turned around and grabbed Ching&rsquo;s arm and tossed him on the ground. *Splat* &ldquo;All you thieves are the same.&rdquo; He proceeded to <strong>break Ching&rsquo;s arm</strong> without hesitation.</p></p>

<p><p>*Crack* &ldquo;AAAAAAH!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Alex and Li joined up and ran down the dark hallway. &ldquo;I heard a scream. I assume you won?&rdquo; Li asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That was the pirates&rsquo; leader. He never stood a chance.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Looks like my little brother is coming a savage.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Alex glanced at her curiously for a brief second.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s a compliment.&rdquo; Li added.</p></p>

<p><p>The two made it to the next cave and they gasped upon the sight of their fallen comrades. Alex ran to the fallen Celina while Li went to check on Shu Tai. Alex lifted Celina by the back. Her eyes were shut and she seemed unconscious, but she showed a reaction when he called her name. Her eyes twitched a little bit and they opened.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Celina! Are you alright? Celina!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;A-Alex? You are here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who did this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Her hand grabbed him by the collar. &ldquo;Be careful. Captain Raizo is a strong enemy.&rdquo; After she muttered those words, she fell unconscious. Alex calmly placed her on the ground and stood up.</p></p>

<p><p>Li looked up. &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it obvious?&rdquo; Alex replied without even facing her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Are you going to fight Raizo? You&rsquo;ll need my help.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, he is mine. He will pay for what he did.&rdquo; He began to run towards the cave&rsquo;s exit. &ldquo;Take care of these two for me!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>(Alex. You have too much of a hero complex. You need to be extremely careful.)</p></p>

<p><p> Alex Cheng has made it outside the cave and immediately the sunlight hit his face. He saw a river not far away and ran towards the river. He saw a man in golden armor and blue hair standing amidst the stream, letting the water run through his ankles.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I thought I told you to stay inside.&rdquo; Raizo said, turning around. &ldquo;Oya...you&rsquo;re not one of my men. Who are you and how did you get here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My name is Alex Cheng. You hurt my friends and I&rsquo;m going to make you pay...you&rsquo;ll rue the day you became a pirate.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Raizo burst into laughter. &ldquo;And how exactly do you plan to do that when I have the legendary Water Sword in my hands!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;With this.&rdquo; Alex&rsquo;s sword glowed red and was set aflame.</p></p>

<p><p>The pirate&rsquo;s eyes widened as he was startled. &ldquo;What the? That&rsquo;s the Legendary Fire Sword. But...the ultimate weapons of legend belongs to the Four Brothers. How did a twerp like you get your hands on this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Alex got into fighting stance. &ldquo;I am a student of Master Genzo of the Four Brothers.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I see! Then you are worthy to be my opponent. I will give you an honorable death.&rdquo; Raizo&rsquo;s blade started to gather water. Alex used the Heat Wave to counter Raizo&rsquo;s Water Slicer and the two forces collided, resulting in an <strong>explosion of steam</strong>. Bits of fire and drops of water splashed all over the place. &ldquo;Ha ha ha ha! Don&rsquo;t you know that water puts out fire, boy?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Alex dashed forward, his feet trotting water with each step and the two clashed blades. Alex used the same attack combination he used to overwhelm Ching, but Raizo deflected his attacks with ease. Then he used Infinity Circle, an attack where the user spins several times, gaining momentum for each swing. *clang-clang-clang-clang* Once again, Raizo deflected his attacks. This frustrated the Demon Slayer. While he pondered what move to use next, he did not notice that during the fight, him and his opponent had switched sides on the river. Alex was standing at the side of the waterfall.</p></p>

<p><p>Water droplets gathered together to form a stream and surrounded the Water Sword&rsquo;s blade. Raizo ran forward while pointing his blade into the water to gather even more water for his attack. Alex used the Heat Wave. *Froom* Raizo used the Water Slicer. However, this time was not like the last time. The water pushed through the fire and hit Alex. He was pushed all the way to the end of the water fall and consequently he fell off the cliff. It was a long fall before he hit the river. *Splash*</p></p>

<p><p>Cheng&rsquo;s body sank deeper and deeper into the water. It seemed dark and endless. Suddenly, he heard a voice call out to him. &ldquo;Alex. Alex.&rdquo; said a male&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Alex!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Alex&rsquo;s eyes opened and he was in disbelief to see Shen Long before his eyes. &ldquo;Shen Long? Is that you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Alex...you must wake up.&rdquo; said Shen Long&rsquo;s voice.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What happened to me? Oh yeah, I lost to Raizo...and now I&rsquo;m drowning, aren&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sui Long appeared. &ldquo;Your story is not over yet. It is not time for you to die.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sui Long? You&rsquo;re here too?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We are always here. We are watching over you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Raizo is too powerful. There&rsquo;s nothing I can do.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How pathetic.&rdquo; said a third voice.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Master Genzo?!&rdquo; Alex exclaimed.</p></p>

<p><p>Appearing between Sui Long and Shen Long was indeed Genzo, aka the War God. His appearance was just as he remembered, wearing the blue vest and straw hat that covered his eyes. &ldquo;Is this what I taught you in our time together? Did I give you the Fire Sword just to lose a duel to some pirate?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But...what am I supposed to do?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You were able to use Heat Wave without any guidance from me. Shortly later, you learned Fire Storm, a move I used in the past. The Fire Sword has accepted you as its master. I knew I made the right choice.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The Fire Sword has accepted me as its master?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Your destiny lies behind here. You are not to die in a place like this. Your destiny...is to become the next generation of the <strong>Four Brothers</strong>.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Four Brothers? I...I don&rsquo;t know what to say.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re stronger than you think. Now go show them your strength, Demon Slayer.&rdquo; Genzo smiled.</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;Alex! Alex!&rdquo; screamed the familiar voice of a woman. Alex&rsquo;s body was on the ground and Celina was kneeling next to him. She kept on shaking him so he would wake up. &ldquo;Alex! Alex!&rdquo; She remembered a technique she read from medical books in her time as a concubine. She pushed his chest with both palms, giving him three thrusts. Then she performed him mouth to mouth to give him air. She repeated this process of CPR three times. Alex coughed water while unconscious.</p></p>

<p><p>Celina was relieved as one can tell from her face. Tai was relieved as well. After that they carried his body to a safer location.</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;DS_E&quot;></a>[ E ] - Showdown: Fire Sword vs Water Sword</p></p>

<p><p>Alex woke up in cold sweat, the cloth on his forehead fell off as he sprang up. He was shirtless and shoeless, wearing only pants. His robe was placed on top of him to keep him warm. Celina was sleeping on his torso and she woke up.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Alex! You&rsquo;re awake.&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I managed to survive somehow.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She embraced him and began sobbing. &ldquo;I thought *sob* you were going to *sob* leave me behind!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Alex returned the embrace as she continued to sob non-stop.. He noticed the bonfire nearby, that is what was keeping them warm. &ldquo;Celina. When I was drowning I heard your voice. You were calling out to me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A short while later, Li Cheng and Tai showed up to the cave&rsquo;s entrance. &ldquo;Our situation is dire.&rdquo; said Li. &ldquo;We are outnumbered by pirates and demons. Also we don&rsquo;t have any food. We need to go find food around the area as well as more wood for the fire. Alex you stay here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Celina stood up. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go anywhere, okay? Just rest.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Alex replied.</p></p>

<p><p>Everyone left Alex alone in the cave. When he tried to move just a little bit, he grunted in pain over his wound. &ldquo;Ugh.&rdquo; He looked down and stared at the bruises left by the Water Sword. The reality of his defeat began to sink in. His robe was dried off already and he put it back on.</p></p>

<p><p>The physical pain was nothing compared to his mental anguish. He was still upset over his loss. Not only that, be he nearly lost his life to a pirate. He set out on a journey to save his beloved but instead he was the one that was saved. He held the Fire Sword up close so he can examine it closely. To be defeated while wielding the Fire Sword means to be a disgrace to Master Genzo.</p></p>

<p><p>Is the Water Sword that powerful? Water droplets gathered together to form a stream and surrounded the Water Sword&rsquo;s blade. Raizo ran forward while pointing his blade into the water to gather even more water for his attack. If the Water Sword gets its power from its source element, then maybe the Fire Sword can get stronger too? He stared at the bonfire and had a thought. He put the Fire Sword over it, and the transferred over to his blade, thus lighting it on fire. It&rsquo;s only natural that happens - fire makes the Fire Sword become stronger. However, he dismissed the thought - during a fight he will not have access to fire. It was a good idea but not practical.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Alex stood up as he saw someone at the cave&rsquo;s entrance. It was a demon in a mask and hooded cape. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darkstalker stuck several knifes between his fingers. &ldquo;You are all alone, Demon Slayer. And inside this small cave there is no room to dodge my attacks.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You think so?&rdquo; He used the Heat Wave. *Froom*</p></p>

<p><p>Darkstalker jumped back to a safe distance. Alex walked out of the cave&rsquo;s entrance. &ldquo;So you thought you&rsquo;d assassinate me while I was injured and alone? It was a good idea. Too bad it&rsquo;s not going to happen.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The demon smirked. &ldquo;This is going to be interesting!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tai brushed aside a tree branch as he walked uphill. &ldquo;Be careful where you step.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Celina replied. It was a difficult walk for someone who&rsquo;s never been in a jungle such as this one. She had to watch out for tree branches hitting her ankle, thus each step had to be carefully placed. There were leaves hitting her face and mosquitoes everywhere. Walking uphill only added to the challenge, as one wrong step will lead her to fall.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Have you heard about the creator of the Water Sword?&rdquo; Tai asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You mean the story of Sha&rsquo;Uri, student of the legendary blacksmith Cho&rsquo;Ann? I read about it from various books in the library. <strong>Sha&rsquo;Uri </strong>was frustrated with his master&rsquo;s strict rules and he thought he could do better. One day he left and created his own ultimate weapon, which is the Water Sword. To surpass his master he worked day and night and the Water Sword was his answer.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Interesting. I&rsquo;ve heard a different version of the story. Cho&rsquo;Ann was a pacifist at heart and did not like creating weapons for the purpose of murder. The four ultimate weapons were an exception because he forged them to save humanity. Sha&rsquo;Uri was full of bloodlust and created weapons solely for the purpose of war. Cho&rsquo;Ann grew tired of his student&rsquo;s misbehavior and eventually disowned him.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Celina pushed aside a tree branch. &ldquo;It seems there are several variations to the legend, aside from the ones you and I know. Even what is recorded in books is not accurate. The older a tale is, the more people change it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It happens.&rdquo; Tai responded. &ldquo;As times change so do people&rsquo;s values. They take old stories and change as they see fit for their convenience.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Alex dodged another set of daggers and was panting for breath. Alex focused his gaze on his blade. The Heat Wave will not work as Darkstalker is agile enough to dodge. On the other hand Alex cannot dodge the daggers any longer. Darkstalker had the advantage...once his prey is cornered he will strike for real. (Besides the Heat Wave, the Fire Sword must have another secret...I&rsquo;m not using it to it&rsquo;s full potential. But what it is? How did the War God use this sword?) Darkstalker opened his black cape and placed daggers between his fingers. Alex did not have much time to contemplate. As he waited for his impending doom, the Demon Slayer prayed for an answer as he put the blade&rsquo;s tip against his forehead. The War God never explained how to use the Fire Sword. Perhaps there wasn&rsquo;t enough time or perhaps it was intentional. Either way he has to figure it out on his own. He could feel a lot of power coming from the Fire Sword. Whether it is sorcery or not, this is one of the ultimate weapons in the world...and he is the heir to it.</p></p>

<p><p>Darkstalker dashed to the side and prepared to throw the daggers. Suddenly Alex opened his eyes. (That&rsquo;s it! I know what to do!) He set his blade aflame and he performed a dance move where he spins his body two full times and swings his blade to the side. *Whip* Suddenly, he was surrounded by a ring of fire on all sides and the fire spread in all directions. *Froom* The flames knocked the daggers away and Darkstalker was caught by surprise and he was hit. He jumped backwards to reduce the damage and landed in a crouch position. His chest was burning. &ldquo;What technique was that?&rdquo; The demon realized that he has lost the advantage and jumped into the forest and vanished into the darkness.</p></p>

<p><p>With the danger gone, things were quiet and Alex had time to contemplate what just happened. The technique he used is definitely the next level of the Heat Wave...He decided to name it the Firestorm. He wondered if Master Genzo used this move...no there is no need to wonder, he definitely used it if he&rsquo;s had the Fire Sword for fifty years.</p></p>

<p><p>Not only did he learn a new move, but he discovered something crucial. The Water Sword needs to be near water to be effective. The Fire Sword uses sorcery to generate fire from the user&rsquo;s chi. In other words, it&rsquo;s power is unlimited.</p></p>

<p><p>*Froom* From their uphill location, the other heroes saw the bright flames produced. &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; asked Tai.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that Alex&rsquo;s technique?&rdquo; Celina asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Without further ado, the team of two hurried back downhill. They made it back at the same time as Li. As soon as they returned to ground level, they expected to see a battle. But rather, it was just Alex, standing there calmly, wielding his ultimate weapon. The look in his eyes was different than before...in fact, Celina has seen this intense look before. It is the look of someone who is confident and ready to meet his destiny.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I am ready for a rematch with Raizo.&rdquo; Alex announced.</p></p>

<p><p>Raizo was seen sitting in lotus position on the grassy lands in front of the river. His eyes were closed and the Water Sword was obviously next to him. Upon sensing someone approaching him, he opened his eyes. Ching limped towards him with a hand holding onto his broken arm.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Raizo! The enemy...is too strong! Alex Cheng...watch out for him!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Raizo stood up and pointed his sheathed sword at him. &ldquo;Grrrr, how dare you show yourself after you have failed me!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please help me! I&rsquo;m injured!&rdquo; Ching grabbed Raizo by the collar.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Get away from me you failure!&rdquo; Raizo kicked him in the hip, knocking him down. Even after falling, Raizo continued to kick him continuously. Ching was injured and now he has to endure even more physical pain. His face was sad and desperate, like that of a child who is abandoned by his mother. At this point Ching wondered why he was being treated so badly. He has served Raizo for many years, raiding ship after ship, and obeying his every command. But all that doesn&rsquo;t mean a thing...because he&rsquo;s a pirate.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly he stopped kicking when he sensed something else. Alex was standing there, far away, but close enough to be recognizable.</p></p>

<p><p>A group of pirates were guarding a cave&rsquo;s hole. Li Cheng appeared alone to confront them. Being confident in their numbers, the pirates yelled their battle cry and charged at her. Li, using her superior footwork and Heaven&rsquo;s Wrath Style, made quick work of these small fries.</p></p>

<p><p>The remaining two pirates got scared and ran into the cave. Li chased them into the darkness but she found the two pirates dead, their bodies full of sharp objects. Darkstalker came out of their shadows.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You killed your own comrades?&rdquo; Li asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I killed them because they were cowards who ran away from the enemy.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have much of a crew left after this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I believe in quality over quantity!&rdquo; Darkstalker disappeared into someone&rsquo;s shadow. Li&rsquo;s eyes darted left and right and occasionally she turned around. She realized that her enemy came out of any shadow, and because of the torches on the wall, she cast three shadows on the walls. She was on constant alert every second, knowing as soon as she lowers her guard is the moment he will strike.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Darkstalker appeared from behind her and threw daggers. Li turned around and blocked the daggers but one hit her thigh. &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; Satisfied with the results, Darkstalker hid yet again and waited for his turn to strike.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Where are you?!&rdquo; Li shouted.</p></p>

<p><p>Sensing impatience, Darkstalker came out of the wall and threw a bunch of daggers at Li. They pierced several of her body parts.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I have you now!&rdquo; The demon jumped out of the wall and stabbed Li with his sword. Li showed no reaction which confused the demon. Li then turned into a doll made of straw. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The real Li was behind the shadow puppet, and she used the Ice Blizzard. *Froom* Darkstalker was hit directly and was knocked back as far as the wall. &ldquo;That technique...it can&rsquo;t possibly be the <strong>Shadow Puppet</strong>? Where did you learn that technique?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Li smiled. &ldquo;None of your business.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darkstallker hopped back into the shadows. &ldquo;It seems that I&rsquo;ve underestimated you, little girl. I will have to use my full strength on you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Raizo walked towards the river, making small splashes with each step. &ldquo;Heh, looks like one defeat isn&rsquo;t enough for you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to settle the score.&rdquo; Alex announced. &ldquo;This time it&rsquo;ll be different.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Such determination! As expected from someone who wields an ultimate weapon! You possess the Fire Sword but after I kill you, the Fire Sword will be mine! I will give you a death worthy of the student of Master Genzo!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Both swordsmen drew their blade at the same time and charged forward, swinging with their determination.</p></p>

<p><p>Celina and Tai went into the forestry area near the main fight, predicting that there might be pirates lurking near their captain. Sure enough, three pirates appeared before them.</p></p>

<p><p>Pirate-A: &ldquo;Oh what do we have here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Pirate-B: &ldquo;Hey it&rsquo;s that woman that we captured. This is where she escaped to.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Pirate-C: &ldquo;Remember when we stripped her and she was like &ldquo;Eyaaaah&rsquo; and got all embarrassed?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Pirate-A: &ldquo;She has a cute cry. And her skin was peachy and smooth! Heh heh heh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The pirates continued to make lewd remarks while Celina&rsquo;s head was facing slightly downwards, and her eyes were not seen. Tai just stared dumbfounded.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Do not help me. I will handle this alone.&rdquo; Celina announced. Without waiting for Tai&rsquo;s answer, she stepped forward and drew her two blades.</p></p>

<p><p>Pirate-B: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re using <strong>two </strong>swords? You&rsquo;re a weak woman who can&rsquo;t even hold one sword! Hehehehehe.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Dude, she looks pretty serious. I&rsquo;d watch out if I was you.&rdquo; said Pirate-C sarcastically.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry babe, I&rsquo;ll go easy on you. Kekekeke.&rdquo; Pirate-B raised his sword and swung it her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Dance of the Sword first form: Dance of the Tiger!&rdquo; She charged forward and landed on one knee and her double blades pierced the pirate&rsquo;s body. *Schleb* One blade went through his <strong>stomach</strong> while the other went through his <strong>neck</strong>. Already dead, he fell backwards.</p></p>

<p><p>The two remaining pirates were shocked. &ldquo;What? She&rsquo;s an expert?!&rdquo; said Pirate-A.</p></p>

<p><p>Pirate-C: &ldquo;We underestimated her!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Both pirates charged at her. &ldquo;Second form: Dance of the Lion!&rdquo; Her blade struck Pirate-A in the <strong>chest</strong> and he fell down.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Third form: Dance of the Eagle!&rdquo; She held her double blades like a pair of scissors and leapt forward, slashing Pirate-A in two places. He dropped his sword and fell.</p></p>

<p><p>Celina then walked over to the fallen Pirate-C. &ldquo;No, wait! Don&rsquo;t do it! Have mercy!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The first one who died was the most fortunate one for he received a quick death.&rdquo; said she without any outward emotion.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No I beg of you! Spare me! Please! UUUUGH!&rdquo; She stabbed his <strong>stomach</strong>, causing him to cough blood. She let the blade pierce his organs for a moment. Then she turned the blade 90 degrees, causing him agonizing pain before he finally died.</p></p>

<p><p>Pirate-A crawled away. &ldquo;No! I can&rsquo;t die here! No!&rdquo; Celina walked over to him in a calm manner - or at least she seemed calm on the surface. Who knows what she was feeling on the inside? She stabbed his thigh, causing him to scream.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It was Cap&rsquo;n Ching...he forced us to those horrible things! I swear!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Celina stabbed him in the <strong>neck</strong>, causing blood to gush out. Seconds later, he died with his eyes wide open. Celina hit the air to flick the blood away from her blade. She took a napkin and wiped off the remaining blood and put her swords back into their shells.</p></p>

<p><p>Tai was dumbfounded at the turn of events. Not only did he not have to do anything, but he realized Celina is a lot stronger than she looks. And she also has a dark side of her that she never reveals to anyone.</p></p>

<p><p>The shadows on the wall kept moving in circles. Li held her sword vertically and closed her eyes. &ldquo;Shadow Puppet!&rdquo; An exact copy of her appeared next to her. Now the two Li&rsquo;s waited for their enemy to strike.</p></p>

<p><p>Darkstalker&rsquo;s eyes opened wide. &ldquo;If you make a puppet I&rsquo;ll just have to take both of you down! Let&rsquo;s see who is the true master of the shadows!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The two Li&rsquo;s stood back to back to get the full range of vision possible. Darkstalker peered his head out of the shadow to take a look. Then the rest of his body came out and he landed in a crouch. The two Li&rsquo;s glanced in his direction. He threw daggers at Li and hit her in the shoulder, stomach and thigh. Then she turned into a doll made of straw.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tch! That was the puppet. So that leaves the real you!&rdquo; Darkstalker charged without hesitation and drew two kodachi&rsquo;s. Li charged at him and took a swing with her blade. Darkstalker ducked, successfully avoiding the attack and stabbed his kodachi into Li&rsquo;s stomach. &ldquo;Got you!&rdquo; Li did not scream or show any signs of pain, but she pulled the dagger deeper into her stomach. &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; asked the bewildered demon, trying to pull his kodachi out. Suddenly, Li turned into a straw doll.</p></p>

<p><p>There was another Li behind the doll, and she ran forward and thrust her Ice Sword through the doll and pierced Darkstalker&rsquo;s stomach. *Schleb* The demon groaned in agony as he stuttered backwards. &ldquo;Ugh! You...can make two shadow puppets?! I see...that&rsquo;s why that puppet did not bleed. I should have noticed it sooner!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh. I never said I can make only one. Ninjas are masters at the art of deception.&rdquo; Li smiled.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You tricked me! You coward!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Li pointed her blade forward. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny coming from someone who hides in someone else&rsquo;s shadow. I mean that literally and figuratively. You just stick around Raizo because you need him to help you absorb souls. You&rsquo;re someone that can&rsquo;t survive on his own. You think you&rsquo;re manipulating him but I wonder if you&rsquo;re the one being manipulated.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You impudent little bitch!&rdquo; Losing his cool for the first time, Darkstalker dashed forward and stuck daggers between his fingers.</p></p>

<p><p>Li used the Ice Blizzard and made a direct hit since the demon dashed straight ahead. As soon as he was hit, most of his body became frozen and he was knocked back against the wall. *Wham* He fell on his knees. His mask, full of icicles fell off his face, and he fell down face flat, landing next to his mask.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Some master of shadows you are if you get triggered so easily. You&rsquo;ve had the advantage in every fight your whole life...it shows in your moves.&rdquo; Li then realized she was talking to a dead body and put her sword back into its shell.</p></p>

<p><p>Alex and Raizo clashed their blades aggressively. *Quong quong quong* Alex had to redeem himself for his prior defeat, and also he had to get revenge for what happened to Celina, so he was not willing to take a step back. Each time he had to step back, he advanced two steps. Raizo also fought with everything on the line, as he cannot afford to lose at a place like this. He must get his revenge on the kingdom he once fought but the same kingdom that betrayed him, making him and outlaw and forcing him to become a pirate. But his pirating days are over...as soon as he gets off this island.</p></p>

<p><p>Both fighters panted for breath as they went all out with the exchanges. Raizo dashed forward with his blade pointed downwards, he flicked water, hitting Alex&rsquo;s face to distract him. *Splash* He struck and Alex blocked. *Cling* Alex swings his blade and Raizo leaned back to avoid it, but the flames hit him. Unfortunately, his armor protected him from the flames.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Enough playing around.&rdquo; said the pirate. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to finish you off once and for all. You&rsquo;re going to be another resident of the Island of the Dead!&rdquo; Once again, streams of water gathered around the blade of the Water Sword.</p></p>

<p><p>This was time for Alex to use his new move...but he was not confident he can do it. Sweat dripped down his face as his Fire Sword glowed. The image of Master Genzo appeared in the blade. It seemed to be saying to him: You can do this Demon Slayer. Believe in Fire Sword. Believe in your own abilities.</p></p>

<p><p>Alex closed his eyes and took deep breaths to calm down. If Master Genzo believes in him...then it should be okay, right? Master has always believed in him, that is why he gave Alex the Fire Sword. He has survived Operation Dragonfly, the Red Feather Rebellion, and many more battles. This is just another battle he must win...to embrace his destiny.</p></p>

<p><p>Alex performed the moves necessary to unleash the <strong>Firestorm</strong> when Raizo released his Water Slicer. The flames overcame the waves of water and hit Raizo hard. He rolled about in the river several times before stopping.</p></p>

<p><p>The pirate panted for breath as he forced himself to stand up. &ldquo;What did you just do? That move was not the same one you used last time!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I told you I&rsquo;m not the same as before.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Did you hold back last time? Or did you just develop that move during this short time? That&rsquo;s impossible!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, is it?&rdquo; Alex replied in a confident tone. &ldquo;You just received the Water Sword and learned the Water Slicer immediately, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Raizo&rsquo;s eyes grew wider. &ldquo;You...I will not let you ruin my plans! You will pay!&rdquo; His sword gathered more water molecules, forming a shield of water around its blade. Alex&rsquo;s blade was set aflame and they charged into each other. *Quong* They went past each other.</p></p>

<p><p>Raizo&rsquo;s Water Sword had a crack on it and he was shocked. His eyes were wide open and his eyeballs were shaking in their sockets. &ldquo;Impossible! My Water Sword is invincible!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you think. Sha&rsquo;Uri was always of jealous of his master Cho&rsquo;Ann. He forged swords and other weapons for the wrong reasons and took shortcuts whenever he could, and two constantly argued. One day Sha&rsquo;Uri left his master&rsquo;s tutelage and he created his own ultimate weapon that could rival Cho&rsquo;Ann&rsquo;s four ultimate weapons. But he cut corners in forging the sword...that&rsquo;s why you were able to learn the Water Slicer so quickly.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie! How would you know?&rdquo; the pirate shouted.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I figured it out from this exchange. If your Water Sword is equal to my Fire Sword, how come it is cracked? Sha&rsquo;Uri realized that his creation was a failure so he hid it in this island. What reason is there for him to go out of his way to hide it on an island full of demons?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Raizo was shocked beyond words and everything in his vision seemed to be spinning. When he first touched the Water Sword he was so delighted because that he finally obtained the key that will lead to his revenge which he planned for many years. After beating Celina and Tai as well as Alex, he truly thought he was invincible. But he stared at the cracked blade...this is his reality. Then he focused his gaze on Alex...this is all his fault. If he kills the silver haired man, then his plan can still succeed. &ldquo;Arrrgh! No! No! You&rsquo;re just a twerp who knows nothing! I will cut you into pieces!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Both Alex and Raizo dashed forward and screamed with all their might. As soon as they were within range, they swing their blades and clashed. The Fire Sword broke through the Water Sword and it pierced Raizo&rsquo;s golden armor, stabbing him in the heart.</p></p>

<p><p>The pirate coughed blood and his hand let go of the sword. He realized that he lost this fight...as well as his life. (No...it can&rsquo;t be...my plans...my revenge...) His whole life flashed before his eyes. He always loved spilling other&rsquo;s blood and killing others and never regretted a single thing he did as a soldier or as a pirate. But this is the first and last time he regretted his decisions...He collapsed and breathed his last breath.</p></p>

<p><p>Alex panted for breath and focused his gaze on the pirate&rsquo;s corpse. (I did it, Master.)</p></p>

<p><p>A <strong>spirit</strong> appeared before him in the form of Master Genzo. Alex just stared in awe. &ldquo;Well done, Alex Cheng.&rdquo; The spirit then turned around and walked away before Alex had a chance to say anything. He wanted to thank his master for entrusting the Fire Sword to him...and also he will not let his master down. But whether that was a spirit or his imagination, he knows that Master Genzo is always watching over him.</p></p>

<p><p>Now that the battle is over, the heroes boarded The Grace to go back home. This was a victory not just for Alex, but for the imperials as well. Two large pirate gangs have been defeated, making the crimson seas safer...relatively safer since there are still pirates gangs lurking around. The Grace and the Black Boat have been converted to imperial ships and added to the navy, making the Shen navy more powerful.</p></p>

<p><p>As for Ching&rsquo;s fate, he was arrested and brought back to the dungeon in the capital city. No trial was administered for him, as this is a special circumstance. Pirates and bandits were the lowest of criminals, thus there was no set system to decide their fate. The general allowed Alex to decide Ching&rsquo;s punishment. After much contemplation, Alex decided death was too easy a way out for someone like Ching. He has another idea...something way more suitable for the leader of pirates.</p></p>

<p><p>Two guards came into his cell. Ching was sitting on the floor full of hay. &ldquo;Have you come to execute me?&rdquo; he asked.</p></p>

<p><p>The guard took out a dagger and put it over a torch, turning the blade red. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re missing your right eye, captain. What would happen if you lost the <strong>other eye?&rdquo;</strong></p></p>

<p><p>Ching panicked. &ldquo;No wait...don&rsquo;t do this! I&rsquo;ll give you all my gold! All of it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The guard approached him with the dagger. &ldquo;Just accept your fate, pirate...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No! I&rsquo;ll give you anything you want! All the gold in the world! You&rsquo;ll be rich!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Outside the cell, one hear Ching&rsquo;s scream of agony echo down the hallway. But such a sound was common in the dungeon, and all the guards ignored it. The other prisoners shuddered at the sound, wondering when it will be their turn next.</p></p>

<p><p>Who was once the captain of the Black Beards was now an ordinary beggar in the slums of the capital city of Yi Ling. Not only was Ching blind, but his hand was a hook and his arm was still broken. He was kneeling on the ground with a bowl in front of him. &ldquo;Please, spare some money or food.&rdquo; he repeated over and over.</p></p>

<p><p>People walking by felt sorry for him. Being homeless is bad enough, but this beggar was more unfortunate than others. His hand was a hook and he was completely blind as well. They dropped coins into his bowl.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Thank you so much! God bless you!&rdquo; Thus, he would repeat that phrase every time he heard coins drop into his bowl.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So what happened to the Water Sword?&rdquo; asked Celina.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in a place where no one will find it.&rdquo; Alex replied. He had a flashback of what he did.</p></p>

<p><p>Alex took the Water Sword from Raizo&rsquo;s corpse and walked towards the very edge of the island where there was a cliff. He held the sword in front of him and took a moment to reflect on all that&rsquo;s happened. Holding the defective Water Sword in his hands makes him appreciate his Fire Sword even more. The four ultimate weapons, one of them being his Fire Sword, were one of a kind forged by Jing Cho&rsquo;Ann. Sha&rsquo;Uri tried to replicate his master&rsquo;s work but failed miserably, resulting in this defect of an ultimate weapon. There is no room for frauds in this world. Alex dropped the Water Sword into the sea...it is a fitting end because it belongs in the water. It sank slowly towards the bottom of the vast ocean, to a depth where no man or demon will ever find it again.</p></p>
