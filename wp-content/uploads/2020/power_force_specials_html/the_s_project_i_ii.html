<p> <hr /> <p>Inside a dark laboratory somewhere, there were sounds of a man screaming in pain. Inside a liquid chamber, the subject was being injected with a steroid. The subject, a muscular man with long, curly, black hair, was wearing only shorts. Wires were attached to his skin, going into his blood.</p></p>

<p><p>The silhouetted figure watched carefully, with a sort of admiration. His glasses shined in the dark. &ldquo;Ahhh, yes, scream. Scream, my subject.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The subject&rsquo;s eyes were closed, but in certain aspects he was awake. He groaned as the dark energy entered his body, and his body is trying to get used to it.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You are going to be the most powerful sayan the world has ever known. The more pain you feel, the more <strong>powerful </strong>you will become.&rdquo; and as he said this, he uttered a sinister laugh.</p></p>

<p> <p>The sun was shining brightly in <strong>Sakume</strong>&rsquo;s room. The alarm clock ran rather loudly. Beep Beep. Beep beep. Sakume&rsquo;s head was buried under his pillow. He woke up and yawned.</p></p>

<p><p>Today&rsquo;s another work day, and he hated work days. And five days out of seven is a work day. On the other hand, he&rsquo;s one of the company&rsquo;s top executives. His title is <strong>Executive Marketing Director</strong>, and his real work involves many things &ndash; marketing operations, financial handlings, and a lot of paperwork. He makes a ton of money, and because of that, he lives in a fancy house. To him, it&rsquo;s not much, but to an &ldquo;average&rdquo; person &ndash; living on minimum wage, it&rsquo;s a lot.</p></p>

<p><p>He wore a tank top and shorts to sleep, and he didn&rsquo;t put anything on as he went to the bathroom to brush his teeth.</p></p>

<p><p> His room is pretty nice &ndash; he gets the envy of many of his friends. But Sakume doesn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a big deal, he doesn&rsquo;t get why they&rsquo;re so &ldquo;ooh ahh&rdquo; over his life. His window has a nice view of the beach and the crystal blue water. On his desk, next to his bed, is a picture of his mom and dad.</p></p>

<p><p>Once Sakume was done with hygiene, he went over to his phone and pressed the play button, playing all the messages he saved but didn&rsquo;t check. As he listened to it, he put on his clothes.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You have ten new messages.&rdquo; Beep. &ldquo;First message.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a female&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Sakume, it&rsquo;s me, Liana. Don&rsquo;t forget, we have tennis practice today. You promised. So you better be there! See ya.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Beep. &ldquo;Sakume, it&rsquo;s me, Johnathan. I just want to remind you that there is going to be a team meeting today at twelve noon. Bring your documents with you, we will be discussing some important matters. I&rsquo;ll see you there.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume just finished adjusting his tie. He took a sigh. So many people reminding him things. So many errands to run. He got into his car and drove. He took the same road every day, so he knew the trip by heart. Despite his &ldquo;normal&rdquo; lifestyle, Sakume Keller has a secret that he doesn&rsquo;t want others to know. In fact, no one knows of his secret, not even his closest buddies. Except for one other person. There were many occasions where he wanted to tell someone his secret, but he just couldn&rsquo;t speak up, and changed the conversation. Keep this from others was hard, but he tried not to think about it, although it pops up in his mind from time to time.</p></p>

<p><p>Before he knew it, he was at his company already: <strong>Z-Corp</strong>. Once he parked the car, he got out, and walked to the front steps. He was dressed in his usual attire &ndash; a light brown suit, matching pants, and a showy tie. He also carried a briefcase. The main entrance had three doors, including two revolving ones. Sakume looked up. The building was a hundred stories high. It even covered the sun from his angle. He took a deep sigh as he stared at it. It&rsquo;s going to be another crazy day at work, he thought. And he was thinking about a dozen things at the same time.</p></p>

<p><p>Looking at the street from his life-sized window, President <strong>Clyne </strong>was thinking deeply too. A woman came to the doorway, and the door was open, so she knocked and walked in.</p></p>

<p><p>Clyne turned around. &ldquo;Ah, <strong>Ms. Faith</strong>. The meeting is about to start. Is everyone here yet?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes sir.&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;<strong>Mr. Keller</strong> just signed in. Mr. Walter and Mrs. Winters are coming here from the first floor caf&eacute;.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume got off the elevator, and walked into the room. The secretary greeted him warmly. &ldquo;Hi Mr. Keller. How are you doing today?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing good, thanks for asking. What about yourself?&rdquo; he said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, so and so. They still didn&rsquo;t give me a raise yet. Can&rsquo;t you talk to the department for me?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, they still didn&rsquo;t do it? Hmm, don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll talk to them again.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Thanks a lot, sir. I appreciate it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No problem.&rdquo; Sakume said with enthusiasm, making a salute gesture.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make promises you can&rsquo;t keep, as they say.&rdquo; said <strong>Liana</strong>.</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume: &ldquo;Wow, looking good as usual, Liana.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Liana: &ldquo;You always have a smart mouth, don&rsquo;t you? Did you get my message?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume: &ldquo;Yep. Loud and clear.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Okay, don&rsquo;t forget.&rdquo; she said winking and walking away. Sakume approached his office, and Clyne came to greet him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Keller. Top of the morning. Looking sharp as usual.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo; he replied.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget, we have a meeting in five minutes.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;m just going to my office to drop off my stuff.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; Clyne left.</p></p>

<p><p>And so, the meeting started. One of the company&rsquo;s top executives, <strong>Mr. Asruel, </strong>was giving a PowerPoint presentation. The slide showed some specs for the new exo suit that is coming out next year.</p></p>

<p><p>At the head of the rectangular round table is of course, the president, Mr. Clyne, and sitting along the side are the other executives. Among them include: Mrs. Winters, Mr. Jones Smith, Mr. Walter, Mr. Simons, and Mr. Sakume Keller.</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel: &ldquo;&#8230;thus, if we use a different source of energy, the consumption of energy of our exo suits will decrease dramatically. And there will be substantial savings involved. And that spells profit.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mr. Walter: &ldquo;Are you proposing that we lower our quality and increase our quantity?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That is exactly it. With a few minor adjustments here and there, we can increase our throughput and productivity by 10%. And the company will continue to grow.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Clyne: &ldquo;Mr. Asruel, your proposal is astounding and well-thought out, but it is not implementable as of now. Using a different source of energy other than energy siphons is just too risky. We cannot sacrifice security for the possibility of gains. Our exo suits have been performing just fine.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel: &ldquo;But sir&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for your presentation. Please have a seat.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; Asruel sat down in his seat, next to Sakume&rsquo;s.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith handed Clyne a folder, and he opened it and began speaking. As he did, Asruel was really pissed off, still focused on his rejection. He was holding a pencil with two hands, and broke it. Sakume noticed, and grew worried.</p></p>

<p><p>When the meeting was over, Asruel went back to his office, and started bitching. &ldquo;That bastard!&rdquo; He sweeps his pen holder off his desk, and the pens fell everywhere. He crumbled papers and ripped them. &ldquo;Clyne&#8230;you think you&rsquo;re so smart, don&rsquo;t you? You&rsquo;re the big shot. You always reject my plans because you know I&rsquo;m brilliant! Let&rsquo;s see how long your good luck will last, president Clyne.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Knock knock. &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo; said Jonathon Clyne.</p></p>

<p><p>Mrs. Winters came in, and handed him a binder. &ldquo;The proposal made this morning has been finalized. We just need your signature.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmm okay.&rdquo; He took a pen and signed the paper, then folded the binder and gave it back to her. &ldquo;I am just glad we came to a conclusion. Most of the executives agreed with this plan. Except for Asruel. I hope I haven&rsquo;t offended him.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Asruel is not a trustworthy person, to be honest. Certainly, you&rsquo;ve noticed?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmmm, but he is one of our top managers. It&rsquo;s hard these days to find individuals with his level of expertise.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;All I am saying is to be careful, Mr. Clyne.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Not to worry, Mrs. Winters. As long as I&rsquo;m here, he won&rsquo;t try anything.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume was sitting in his office, in deep thought. He had a million things that needed to be done &ndash; reports to write and documents to sign, but he just didn&rsquo;t feel like doing it right now. He was just thinking about the old days &ndash; the good old days (or bad, depending on how you look at it) of the <strong>Great War</strong>. Although there was a war going on, things were much simpler. People were happier, especially after winning a battle. But after the war was over, some veterans migrated to other planets to avoid being hunted down. And Sakume Keller is one of them. He hasn&rsquo;t told this secret to anyone. Except for Clyne.</p></p>

<p><p>Knock knock. &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo; he said.</p></p>

<p><p>Johnathon came in.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Clyne?&rdquo; Sakume said.</p></p>

<p><p>Clyne sat down. &ldquo;Please, you can call me Jonathon if you wish. So, Sakume, how are you doing?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing fine.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You say that, but your expression tells me otherwise. Is something bothering you?&rdquo; Clyne asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that&#8230;well&#8230;this job has a lot of stress.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what making big money is all about, isn&rsquo;t it? Try being the president. I deal with much more crap than you do, I bet.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I know. But on my way to work, I was just reminiscing over the old days. You know? We never had to deal with these&#8230;complicated matters. Back then, during the war, it&rsquo;s either kill or be killed.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Commander.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I told you not to call me that here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh sorry. I just forgot for a moment.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You have to remember that. If anyone finds out that we&rsquo;re sayans, we could be in big trouble.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They both laughed.</p></p>

<p><p>Outside their door, Asruel just heard most of the conversation. He was smiling curiously the whole time. He walks away, thinking of a way to ruin Clyne.</p></p>

<p><p>Being one of the top executives of Z-Corp, Asruel has a fabulous lifestyle, one that is admired by most of the population. But despite being filthy rich (and I mean filthy), he&rsquo;s not happy at all. Aside from his 50,000 sq ft. mansion, he has his own swimming pool.</p></p>

<p><p>Sitting on a chair by his swimming pool, and wearing sunglasses, Asruel was getting a nice tan.</p></p>

<p><p>One of his lackies, <strong>Lanson</strong>, went to him to give him a folder. &ldquo;Here is the information you requested, sir.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Good work.&rdquo; Asruel complimented as he opened the folder and looked at the documents. It showed black and white photos of Johnathan Clyne, with some biographical information on him. &ldquo;Very good work, Lanson.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Thank you sir.&rdquo; Lanson said as he bowed. It was an honor and a pleasure working for Asruel, a rich and powerful man.</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel: &ldquo;With this evidence, I will ruin Clyne for sure. Ha ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>As Clyne was about to finish his work for the day, he decided to look into the company funds and financial statements. As he reviewed them he was satisfied, but he noticed one thing did not seem right. The numbers just did not add up. And that curiosity made him research more. Much more deep. He discovered funds that said were going to some place, but did not go to that certain place.</p></p>

<p><p>(What&rsquo;s going on here?) he thought. (Where did all this money go?)</p></p>

<p><p>It was not much money lost, but it all added up. A few dollars in this department, a few dollars here and there. All &ldquo;little mistakes&rdquo; that could be overlooked. But the sum of the lost was not small &ndash; it added up to $20 million.</p></p>

<p><p>Clyne was astonished. How did $20 million dollars just disappear like that? It can&rsquo;t be a coincidence.</p></p>

<p><p>Knock knock. Mrs. Winters came in.</p></p>

<p><p>Cylne: &ldquo;Mrs. Winters. I&rsquo;ve discovered something very surprising. It may shock you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Winters: &ldquo;Sir, I have pretty much seen and been through everything. What is it that you want to show me?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking into the company database, and I have discovered that $20 million in funds are missing! This is preposterous!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Twenty million?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Can you look into this matter?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Right away, sir.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Still curious and a little upset, Clyne went to the database PC in the inventory room. He logged to the computer and began investigating. He found something very interesting. The most log on and log offs were from mainly one person &ndash; Asruel.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Asruel.&rdquo; he said out loud. Now Clyne is really pissed.</p></p>

<p><p>Pong! Pong! Liana passed the ball to Sakume, who passed it back. They were playing a game of tennis, as he promised her yesterday and this morning. It was probably the most athletic thing he can do on this planet.</p></p>

<p><p>Unbeknownst to them, a stranger in an overcoat was watching them.</p></p>

<p><p>After a while, Liana got tired. She was sweating heavily and breathing hard. &ldquo;*Huff huff*&rdquo; She went to then net. &ldquo; *Huff* I can&rsquo;t take this anymore. I need a break.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume: &ldquo;Oh c&rsquo;mon, you gotta be kidding me. This was your idea.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Need water. *huff* &rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Liana went towards her table, but the stranger was in front of her. &ldquo;Hey excuse me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The stranger just looked at her. He was wearing glasses, so his eyes can&rsquo;t be seen. His hair was long and grayish, like that of a rock star, and his hands were in his pockets.</p></p>

<p><p>Liana: &ldquo;Can you play with my friend over there for a while? Because I need to take a break. Please?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Stranger: &ldquo;Hmm, okay.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Liana: &ldquo;Great, thanks a lot.&rdquo; She handed him the racket.</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume: &ldquo;Now what&rsquo;s she up to?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The stranger walked over to the court and took off his glasses. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be your opponent. Start the game.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume was like eh, what the hell. He served. <strong>Toya</strong> hits the ball back to him, and Sakume runs and hits it back. And after a few hits, Sakume realized this guy&rsquo;s pretty good. He must be an athlete of some sort. His movements are quick and his reflexes are keen. Sakume wondered&#8230;could be a sayan like him? Naw, it can&rsquo;t be.</p></p>

<p><p>Liana drank a bottle of water thirstily, and half of the bottle was gone right away. As she watched these two &ldquo;pros&rdquo; play, she realized that they&rsquo;re good. Both of them rarely miss a ball. And when they do, it&rsquo;s because of unavoidable circumstances. And pretty soon, other people from the courts started watching. Liana can&rsquo;t believe a small crowd was watching them.</p></p>

<p><p>The players didn&rsquo;t notice the spectators; they were too focused on the game.</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume: (Man&#8230;this guy&rsquo;s good. How am I going to beat him?) And he wonders if this man thinks the same of him.</p></p>

<p><p>Soon enough, the game was over. Both Toya and Sakume were sweating heavily and breathing hard. &ldquo;Good match.&rdquo; Sakume offered his hand, Toya shook it.</p></p>

<p><p>Liana ran to them. &ldquo;Wow guys, that was a good match. I was really surprised.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you enjoyed the show, miss.&rdquo; said the stranger, and he turned around to leave.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wait.&rdquo; Sakume said. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t even met yet. &ldquo;My name is Sakume Keller.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m Toya&#8230;Toya Sayram.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Toya&#8230;I know it may seem strange to ask&#8230;but would you like to have tea?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes. And no, it is not strange at all.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>And so, they went to some outside caf&eacute; to enjoy some tea. Liana wanted to join them, but unfortunately, she still had work to be done at the office.</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume took a sip of tea. &ldquo;Ahhh, it&rsquo;s so good.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo; Toya replied.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So, where are you from?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Toya: &ldquo;A very far away place. I am new around here. You can say I&rsquo;m a newbie.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They laughed lightly.</p></p>

<p><p>Toya: &ldquo;You must love the city, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume: &ldquo;Ah, there&rsquo;s nothing good about it. All I do is work, work and work. There&rsquo;s so much stress at my job it&rsquo;s not even funny.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it is a common thing here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh, you can say that.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I see you are not used to life here&#8230;on earth.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Uhhh&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;To be honest with you, when I say I am not from around here, I <strong>really</strong> mean not from around here. I am a sayan from planet Arlia.&rdquo; Toya said.</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume was surprised.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I can tell you are just like me. A sayan, am I right, Sakume?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes&#8230;you can tell, can you? Aye, I&rsquo;m not surprised. We sayans are able to tell if another is a sayan. It must be a gift.&rdquo; Sakume replied, with a slight feeling of relief. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m glad you told me. I&rsquo;m quite surprised you&rsquo;re so upfront with this. I&rsquo;ve been hiding my identity for years.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Because of the authorities?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Fear of going to jail is motivation enough to abandon one&rsquo;s past identity. But I&rsquo;m glad you told me, Toya. I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m not the only one.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Toya: &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m glad you invited me here. I do not really have friends.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>And on and on they talked. Sakume lost track of time. He&rsquo;s glad he made a new friend. Maybe even a best friend.</p></p>



<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="SP_I_B">[B] - The Accusation </span></p></center>

<p><p>Faith was standing on the side as Clyne was checking the computers, and he&rsquo;s frustrated. She wanted to help in any way possible. &ldquo;Sir&#8230;&rdquo; she said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. Can you excuse me for a moment? I have to meet Asruel in my office.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith nodded and walked out. She was still worried as she closed the door, but he doesn&rsquo;t want her there, so there&rsquo;s nothing she can do. As she walked, Asruel was walking towards the office, and towards her.</p></p>

<p><p>She felt anxious as he approached. This man didn&rsquo;t have a trustworthy face. He always looks like he&rsquo;s scheming something, and according to the rumors Faith has heard, it may be true. Her heartbeat increased as he walked past her. She&rsquo;s afraid he might say something or yell at her. Luckily, he didn&rsquo;t even cast a glance at her.</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel walked in. &ldquo;You called, boss?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Clyne had his hands folded. &ldquo;Close the door.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel did so, and sat down. &ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s so urgent you had to see me right away?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Drop the act, Leon. I know what you&rsquo;ve been up to.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Clyne&rsquo;s boldness and straightforwardness really pissed him off. It&rsquo;s another reason why he doesn&rsquo;t like Clyne &ndash; his straightforward rudeness.</p></p>

<p><p>So he tried to play it out. &ldquo;What do you mean, boss?&rdquo; he said, shrugging his shoulders. &ldquo;I have no idea what you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You know what I&rsquo;m talking about. There&rsquo;s twenty million in funds missing from the company. And I checked the records. You&rsquo;re responsible for it. What the hell did you do with the money, Leon Asruel?&rdquo; At this point, he was practically yelling. &ldquo;Did you spend that on your new yacht!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t talk to me that way. Without me you&rsquo;d be screwed, Mr. Clyne. For your information, I spent that money wisely. I put the money into buying dark energy to fuel our exo suits. This way it&rsquo;s cheaper and we can mass produce them easier.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You did what?!&rdquo; Clyne said, almost getting up. &ldquo;You bought dark energy? Do I need to mention that stuff is dangerous&#8230;and illegal?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only illegal if you get caught.&rdquo; Asruel said cockily.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You sacrificed security for price? Do you realize our exo suits are not safe with dark energy? Who knows what will happen?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not for us to worry about, is it? Everything I&rsquo;ve done is for the good of the company.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wrong. Everything you&rsquo;ve done is for your selfish greed! If you don&rsquo;t make amends I will have you exposed!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel smiled. It&rsquo;s time to use his trump card. &ldquo;Exposed? For what? Helping the company save money? If you expose me, then I should have to expose you as well&#8230;Mr. Commander of the sayan army.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done my research, Mr. Johnathon Clyne. Or should I say, <strong>Tyrus Menias</strong>?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Did you think you can hide such information from me, Mr. Tyrus?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How dare you.&rdquo; Clyne stood up, walked over and grabbed him by the collar.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What are you going to do? Beat me up and force me to stay silent?&rdquo; he said, with that same wicked smile on his face.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No one&rsquo;s going to believe you. You&rsquo;re a fraud! You embezzled company money.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wrong. Everyone&rsquo;s going to believe me, because you&rsquo;re a sayan scum. And <strong>you</strong> embezzled company money.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Clyne felt a paralyzing pain in his stomach. He looked down and saw Asruel&rsquo;s fist dug into his stomach. He collapsed and lost consciousness.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;At least that what it will say on the papers.&rdquo; Asruel added.</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel immediately calls a meeting &ndash; all executives attended. Faith stood at the back, holding her binder against her chest. Everyone expected the chairman to be there, but instead, it was Asruel. He stood at the head of the table as everyone else was seated.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen of Z-Corp. You&rsquo;re all seasoned veterans in your field, and you&rsquo;ve contributed much to our fine company. But I&rsquo;m afraid you have been working for the wrong leader this whole time. And I&rsquo;ll get to the point quickly. Chairman Clyne has been embezzling funds from our company. Twenty million in funds, to be exact.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>There was a big reaction amongst them.</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume: &ldquo;What? That is outrageous!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Winters: &ldquo;No way&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jones Smith: &ldquo;Mr. Asruel, do you know what you&rsquo;re saying?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was clinging on to her binder tightly, as she stared in disbelief. Her eyeballs were shaking.</p></p>

<p><p>Leon: &ldquo;Everyone calm down! I know it may be hard to believe, but it is true. Not to mention the fact that he is not even qualified to run the company &ndash; for he is a sayan!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Walter: &ldquo;Mr. Clyne is a sayan?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Leon: &ldquo;Correct. He&rsquo;s an illegal alien. If you don&rsquo;t believe me&#8230;&rdquo; He tossed a bunch of documents on the table. They had the chairman&rsquo;s picture and various information regarding his background. &ldquo;These files are confidential, but I managed to find them somehow.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>All the executives grabbed a sheet and looked at them in disbelief.</p></p>

<p><p>Winters: &ldquo;Chairman Clyne&#8230;has deceived us? I cannot believe this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Walter: &ldquo;So he is a fraud.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume: &ldquo;This can&rsquo;t be. Surely you don&rsquo;t believe this, do you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Walter: &ldquo;The evidence is in front of us.&rdquo; <br>  Jones Smith: &ldquo;Aye. We can&rsquo;t deny the truth.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume: &ldquo;Whether he is a sayan or not, Mr. Clyne is not a criminal! Everything he did is for the good of the company. I assure you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already contacted the police. They should be here at anytime.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Clyne just woke up, and he&rsquo;s angry. He stuttered all the way to the meeting, and grabbed Asruel by the collar. &ldquo;You lying son of a bitch! I&rsquo;ll get you. You scum!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel: &ldquo;The only scum here is you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The cops came in and arrested Clyne immediately.</p></p>

<p><p>Clyne: &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t get away with this, Asruel.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel: &ldquo;Officers, take this man away. He&rsquo;s committed fraud and embezzled funds from our company. And on top of that, he&rsquo;s an illegal immigrant. Make sure he never comes back.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The cops took him outside, in handcuffs. Sakume went to him. &ldquo;Sir&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Clyne: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright. I&rsquo;ll be fine. I&rsquo;m innocent. They won&rsquo;t be able to persecute me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sir&#8230;&rdquo; Sakume repeated dumbly.</p></p>

<p><p>Then Faith tried to talk to him. &ldquo;Mr. Clyne&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ms. Faith, I&rsquo;ll be fine. Don&rsquo;t worry about me. Please preserve my room. I know you&rsquo;ll do a good job like you always have.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She didn&rsquo;t know what to say. She is a woman of few words, and she was really worried for him. Faith just watched helplessly as they took him out.</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume went back to the meeting room to sit down. He was distressed, just like all the other executives.</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel: &ldquo;Now that Mr. Clyne has been revealed for the true person he is, our company needs a new president. And I think I am the best man for the job. Do any of you disagree?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mrs. Winters: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. This is all so sudden. We can&rsquo;t make a decision right away.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Walter: &ldquo;Sure we can. Chairman Clyne is gone, and someone needs to run our company. Our company won&rsquo;t run by itself. Mr. Asruel is the most experienced out of all of us. He has my vote.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jones Smith: &ldquo;I think Mr. Asruel will make a good president. He <strong>did</strong> expose Mr. Clyne after all.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Keller: &ldquo;You guys are not serious? Mrs. Winters &ndash; you trust Jonathon the most. Please don&rsquo;t tell me you are going to vote for him too?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Winters: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure. But&#8230;we do need a president right now. Unless you have another idea, Mr. Keller?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel: &ldquo;Mr. Keller, I know you are upset. But I am doing what&rsquo;s best for the company. If you want to be president, please let me know. But if not, I suggest you sit down and stop disturbing our members.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Keller sat down, since he had nothing else to say. He was quite disappointed.</p></p>

<p><p>Now that Clyne is out of the way, Asruel can do whatever he wants. He felt a sense of joy he&rsquo;s never felt before &ndash; a feeling he had since the war. As he walked into what was once Clyne&rsquo;s office, he saw Clyne&rsquo;s secretary, or girlfriend. No one knows what the relationship between them two is. But Asruel doesn&rsquo;t care. She&rsquo;s just a woman.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was picking up the binders from Clyne&rsquo;s desk. She was sad that he had to go. She knows deep down inside he&rsquo;s innocent. And she really cared about him, but now that he&rsquo;s temporarily gone, she&rsquo;s on her own. She was so deep in her thoughts she didn&rsquo;t even notice someone coming in, as her back was facing him.</p></p>

<p><p>She turned around and bumped into Asruel and she dropped the binders. &ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; she said meekly, and she bent down to pick up the binders.</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel just stared at her as she picked them up desperately. She takes her job seriously, too seriously. But that&rsquo;s what makes her attractive. She&rsquo;s easy on the eyes and reliable, and submissive, which is exactly his type.</p></p>

<p><p>She picked up all the binders and stacked them together. She held them close to her chest and started to move, but Asruel stood in her way. &ldquo;Excuse me...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Clyne is gone now. Why are you bothering with his documents?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith took a step back. &ldquo;H-He&rsquo;s innocent. He&rsquo;s not a bad person.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel advanced. &ldquo;But he is. He&rsquo;s a sayan scum.&rdquo; As he advanced, Faith retreated until her hip bumped the desk. Now there&rsquo;s no room to move at all. &ldquo;And he&rsquo;s gone now...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s eyes were shaking from fear. Her hands clutched the binders tightly against her chest.</p></p>

<p><p>Something about Asruel&rsquo;s eyes were disconcerting. Her entire career, she has been working for Clyne so she&rsquo;s under his protection, so nothing happened. But every time she sees Asruel, she gets a feeling of uneasiness. But now, Clyne is not here...and she is stuck alone with this villain.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;N-No...please...&rdquo; she murmured.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now...I can have you all to myself.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He grabbed her arms, and she gasped and dropped all the binders. *Thud thud thud* He leaned in and kissed her lips. This took her by complete surprise. Her eyes were wide open with shock. Her hands couldn&rsquo;t push away his body, and he kept leaning into her as their lips were locked. &ldquo;Mmmmmmfff!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>His hands moved towards her back to hold her tighter. This is Faith&rsquo;s first kiss, and she hasn&rsquo;t even been with a man, ever. She couldn&rsquo;t believe that this villain stole her first kiss from her like this. But there wasn&rsquo;t even time to process it... once Asruel had enough, he put his face into her neck and kissed her all over. She moaned and struggled. But her frail arms could do nothing.</p></p>

<p><p>He pushed her on the desk and held her by the wrists. He let out a triumphant laugh as he ripped the front of her blouse. *Scrrrrr* He put his face in her breasts and let himself loose. Faith moaned in agony. She couldn&rsquo;t do much in this position. She couldn&rsquo;t believe he stole her first kiss...he&rsquo;s a ruthless man who treats women like objects. And to him, she&rsquo;s just a piece of meat. She&rsquo;s going to lose a lot more than a kiss...</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel sat on what was once Clyne&rsquo;s chair. It felt good. He now owns whatever Clyne owned. It all belongs him and him alone.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is my office now!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;And I can do anything I want!&rdquo; He threw office supplies at the trophies on the shelves. Things broke. He typed on the keyboard and accessed Clyne&rsquo;s personal files. And now they&rsquo;re his files. He felt ecstatic just being here, ruining Clyne&rsquo;s stuff. &ldquo;I can break his trophies if I want. I can break anything I want. And I can access his computer.&rdquo; Then he grabbed binders and threw them in the air, and papers fell all over the place. &ldquo;And all his documents are mine!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Then he grabbed Faith and put her on the desk. &ldquo;And I can fuck his woman on my desk.&rdquo; He kissed her neck and ripped her blouse, while she could do nothing to defend herself.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was barely conscious, and lying on the desk. Asruel stared at her body with much horniness. She was wearing a black business jacket, with a tank top, and probably a bra underneath. Her skirt was pink, and it was pretty short. Her pantyhose was black, and her shoes were pink. And he&rsquo;s going to strip it all away piece by piece.</p></p>

<p><p>She was moaning in pain. Her body is practically asking to be raped, he thought. And he stripped her and raped her.</p></p>

<p><p>Hours later, Asruel was done with her. He put his clothes back on and buttoned up his shirt. Faith lay on the floor completely naked, her back facing up. She was sweating all over from the torture. Poor Faith cried silently.</p></p>

<p><p>With all this going on, Sakume did not know what else to do. He thought he&rsquo;d at least try to enjoy his day with Toya.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Toya said, sipping coffee. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re very stressed out, right?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Sakume replied. &ldquo;This is all happening so sudden.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Your boss is going to jail?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, right now as we speak. This is all that guy Asruel&rsquo;s fault.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Toya seemed to have a reaction to that name, but he hid it well.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Mr. Clyne was framed. I&rsquo;m sure of it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I see. And you really want to help your friend.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I want to clear his name, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Things happen that we have no control over.&rdquo; Toya said. &ldquo;But you can do something about. Do not let your circumstances control you. It is man who makes his circumstances. It&rsquo;s an old sayan proverb.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; Sakume said, feeling a little better.</p></p>

<p><p>Afterwards, Toya walked alone. Asruel showed up. &ldquo;There you are. You shouldn&rsquo;t run off without permission.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I was just taking a walk.&rdquo; Toya replied. &ldquo;I am not some animal who is chained up.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;On the contrary, you are.&rdquo; Asruel pulled up his sleeve, revealing a gauntlet with buttons on it. He pushed the red button, and Toya felt instant pain.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aaagh!&rdquo; It was so bad he fell to his knees and grabbed his head.</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel just finished his shower. He came out in a bathrobe. He went to the living room. Faith was sleeping on the sofa. As he approached, she woke up, and gasped. She sat up on the sofa, clutching the blanket close to her breasts. He got on top of her, and they struggled. He kissed her lips as she struggled. They fell on the floor, and continued struggling, but she was barely putting up any resistance.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was moaning in pain, as he was screwing her savagely. Her fingers grabbed the carpet, and her feet kicked helplessly. He kissed her neck, and her breasts, drowning his face into them. His hands grabbed her wrists tightly.</p></p>

<p><p>His hand reached into the blanket and grabbed her thigh and vagina. She moaned.</p></p>

<p><p>Knock knock. Asruel stopped what he was doing. &ldquo;Goddam it.&rdquo; He fixed his bathrobe and walked towards the door and opened it.</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume came in. &ldquo;Mr. Asruel&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What is it? Can&rsquo;t you see I&rsquo;m very busy?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Then he saw the woman lying on the floor.</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel can see the look of disgust and shock on his face. &ldquo;Well, what is it? Let&rsquo;s make this quick.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Is this how you treat women?&rdquo; Sakume said, with much anger.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What I do during my spare time is none of your business, Mr. Keller. So keep your nose out!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s Mr. Clyne&rsquo;s girlfriend.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Not anymore. After what happened to him, what woman would still want him? Ha ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume&rsquo;s fist tightened, but he had to restrain himself. &ldquo;Women are not objects or playthings. They are people &ndash; human beings just like you and me!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So what&rsquo;s your point? You gonna call the police and sue me? Ha. Get real. With my money and prestige, I can do whatever I want. I&rsquo;ll get rid of her once I&rsquo;m done with her. So what did you come here for, Mr. Asruel? Well?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about Mr. Clyne.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel turned his head to the side. &ldquo;Oh no, not this. Did you come here just to waste my time?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Clyne is a good man. I know he won&rsquo;t do such a thing like embezzling money from the company. He won&rsquo;t do something immoral like that.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, but the truth is the truth.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>As the men were talking, Faith crawled on the floor quietly, hoping to escape.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ve made a big mistake.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one making a mistake. Now, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me. I am a very busy man.&rdquo; said Asruel.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith, wrapped in a blanket, ran for it. Asruel grabbed her blanket. &ldquo;Where do you think you&rsquo;re going?&rdquo; He pulled her into him, and got her in a headlock. She struggled to get free, and squirmed. &ldquo;Mr. Keller, I can do anything I want! This is my mansion. Now, I think you&rsquo;ve over stayed your welcome.&rdquo; He pushed Faith to the floor.</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume was really pissed at this point, but he knew fighting would not solve anything. He had the burning itch to punch this guy&rsquo;s face, but he held back.</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel opened his sleeve a little, revealing a gun. &ldquo;Now, I think you have some business to attend to, don&rsquo;t you? We are both busy people.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume turned around and left. The guards helped him to the exit.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was suffering and crying on the floor. Asruel was glad that nuisance left. &ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s continue where we left off, shall we?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith crawled up, grabbing the sofa, and ran for it. Asruel grabbed her blanket, pulled it off, and she was naked. He pulled her into his arms, and kissed her lips. He pushed her on the floor, and got on top and ravaged her. Her screams echoed throughout the mansion.</p></p>


<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="SP_I_C">[C] - Mistreatment </span></p></center>

<p><p>Sakume, walking out the front gate, decided to turn back. Something in his guts told him to. He attacked the two guards who showed him the exit. Wham! Whack! They were knocked out.</p></p>

<p><p>He barged into the door, and into the mansion, breaking things in the hallway. More guards charged at him, he beat them up as they came. Then, the wall crashed apart and Toya showed up.</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume: &ldquo;Toya? It&rsquo;s you? What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You should not break into other people&rsquo;s houses.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What? You work for Leon? Please tell me it&rsquo;s not so.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; Toya replied. &ldquo;I have no choice.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume was shocked and disappointed. And here he was, thinking he made a new friend. A friend just like him &ndash; a sayan immigrant. But he works for a rich scumbag.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please leave.&rdquo; Toya said, firing a ray.</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume was knocked away. He got up. &ldquo;Ugh&#8230;if that&rsquo;s how it is. I must clear Mr. Clyne&rsquo;s name. I won&rsquo;t let my circumstances control me!&rdquo; He charged and they exchanged some moves.</p></p>

<p><p>Wham! Pow! Kapow! Sakume pushed Toya out of the building, crashing through the wall. They both got up and got into fighting stance.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You disappoint me, Toya.&rdquo; Sakume charged. Toya defended, but he got punched in the face, and he skidded along the dirt. Scrrrrch.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I am sorry to have to do this.&rdquo; Toya said, getting up. He powered up to the max, screaming. His coat was being blown upwards due to his energy. Frrrrrrooom. A beam of vertical energy surrounded him, Sakume winced. His hair turned a golden color &ndash; he became the <strong>Super Sayan</strong>.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No way&#8230;you&rsquo;re a&#8230;super sayan?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I am a super sayan. But my ability to transform is not natural; it was made in a laboratory. Asruel has been stealing money from Z-Corp to put into this project.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re the subject? Is that why you&rsquo;re obeying him, Toya?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My name is <strong>Dexteria</strong>.&rdquo; Super sayan Toya flew up and charged up a beam.</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume formed a shield. Toya&rsquo;s charge was done, and he fired. Kaboom! Nearly the whole ground blew up. Chunks and chunks of rocks floated. As for Sakume, he fell somewhere; he didn&rsquo;t even know what the hell happened. &ldquo;Ugh&#8230;uhhh&#8230;&rdquo; He got up, and Dexteria was in front of him. &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Whack! He was kicked, and sent flying backwards, and Dexteria flew up to hit him just before he fell. Kapow!</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;There is no way you can win. Please leave.&rdquo; Dexteria said. He walked away from the crispy, burning Sakume.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Damn you&#8230;Toya&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mrs. Winters: &ldquo;I still can&rsquo;t believe what&rsquo;s happened so far. It happened so sudden.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mr. Smith: &ldquo;Tell me about it. It&rsquo;s like one day our president is Clyne, and the next day it&rsquo;s Asruel. And you know something, Clyne was a good guy. I actually believe he&rsquo;s innocent.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mrs. Winters: &ldquo;Yes, I know. He is a tough businessman, but at the end of the day, he&rsquo;s honest. He hasn&rsquo;t done anything wrong. Asruel, on the other hand&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mr. Smith: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trust that guy. I think he framed Clyne.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I heard some really bad rumors about him. It gives me the creeps.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Rumors?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He may be psychotic. He&rsquo;s a sick and demented sadist, and also a rapist. There are rumors about his criminal record. Thinking about it gives me the creeps. Who knows what this guy does behind close doors?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sounds of a woman screaming can be heard from the laboratory. Faith laid on the metallic table, her wrists and ankles chained to the platform. Her breasts and vagina were covered by pink ribbons.</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel pulled the lever, and the platform turned diagonal. He went towards her, and grabbed her chin. Faith was scared to death, and tears drip from her eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, darling, this won&rsquo;t hurt a bit. I promise.&rdquo; He kissed her lips, and made the kiss last a while. Then he shoved her panties into her mouth.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mmmmfffff!&rdquo; she moaned.</p></p>

<p><p>He then put on his goggles, and went to the control panel. The fun was about to begin. People have different hobbies &ndash; they go fishing, biking, sketching, and other things. But his hobbies are different. And people think of him as weird and creepy. But he didn&rsquo;t care. This is what gives turns him on and gives meaning to his life.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith feared for her life as she heard mechanical sounds. She&rsquo;s completely helpless, she can&rsquo;t move a bit, except her head. The table she&rsquo;s lying on turned horizontal. What is this madman up to?</p></p>

<p><p>From the ceiling, a laser gun moved towards her. It descended. The targeting laser pointed at the table &ndash; the area between her legs. Asruel then pushed the button. The laser fired. Zzzzzzt. Then it moved up &ndash; closer and closer &ndash; and its ultimate destination was her womanhood.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith screamed and groaned for her life, turning her head, and shedding tears. She really thought she was going to die. Die painfully at the hands of this madman. The laser got closer and closer. Each moment she was closer to death. A painful, agonizing death.</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel laughed. Faith kept on screaming and turning her head. She struggled with all her might, but it was no use. The chains were solid. Her ankles and wrists were locked. There was no escape from this machine.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Asruel&rsquo;s cell phone rang. He stopped the machine, and the laser stopped. Faith breathed in relief, and shut her eyes. She was exhausted from the torment.</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel: &ldquo;What is it, damn it? This better be important? &#8230; What? Showing signs of resistance? Well, give him more of the drugs! &#8230; Figure it out, damn it!&rdquo; He shut off the phone. Then he stared at Faith. &ldquo;Now, where were we?&rdquo; He pushed the button, and the laser continued firing.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith screamed. &ldquo;MMFFF! MMFFFF!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was cuffed to the table, completely naked, except for ribbons tied up around her body. The laser was going between her legs. She screamed for mercy.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, just before it hit her vital spot, Asruel made the laser go sideways, and it went towards her thigh. She kept on moaning. The laser stopped just as it contacted her skin, leaving a little mark. It hurt.</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel: &ldquo;Where should I make the incision? Here?&rdquo; The laser gun moved up, and its light pointed at her stomach. Faith screamed. The laser went to her breasts. &ldquo;Or here?&rdquo; And moved up to her neck. &ldquo;Or maybe here?&rdquo; Then it pointed at her mouth, then forehead. Faith winced from the bright lights. It was a front row seat to a horror show. The laser fired, Faith turned her head, and it hit the spot next to her head.</p></p>

<p><p>The laser machine withdrew, and now became a saw. Faith moaned and groaned. Asruel laughed maniacally. The saw lowered until it almost touched her. It was at her vagina, and it cut the ribbons slightly. It cut her ribbons as it moved up to her stomach, and breasts, and neck.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;MMfffff!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Then it went to her face. Faith stared at the deadly rotating blade without blinking. Tears drip from her eyes as death approached her.</p></p>

<p><p>The laser got closer and closer to her vagina, but at the last second, it stopped. Asruel made it move to the right, and it went towards her leg. Faith turned her head and moaned loud.</p></p>

<p><p>The laser got closer and closer, and just as it touched her skin, it stopped. It left a black mark on her skin.</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel laughed. But wasn&rsquo;t over yet. The machine now turned into a drill. The drill went over to her leg, and it lowered. Faith feared for her life. The drill lowered, and she moved her leg away. Her ankles were cuffed, so she couldn&rsquo;t move much. The drill hit the table, missing her skin by mere millimeters. Then the drill went up, moved a little to the left, and dived. Faith moved her leg the other way.</p></p>

<p><p>The drill moved over to her stomach. It was directly above her belly button. &ldquo;MMFF! MFFFMFF!&rdquo; she moaned.</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel: &ldquo;Ha ha ha ha!! I have you now!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The spinning drill lowered and almost touched her stomach. Faith shut her eyes and prepared for the worse, as tears drip down her face. But a second or two passed, and she didn&rsquo;t feel anything. She opened her eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel was toying with her, and he was enjoying it. He&rsquo;s going to make her suffer as much as she can suffer. Humans can be interesting. He wondered how much fear and torment one can take.</p></p>

<p><p>The drill moved a little to the right, and dived, Faith squirmed to the left. The drill hit the table &ndash; doosh. And the drill went to the right, and she dodged to the left, and he kept on going. She moaned and groaned each time it tried to hit her.</p></p>

<p><p>Then the drill went to her breasts. Then directly over her forehead, between her eyes. She stared at the drill fearfully. It made a sound as it spins &ndash; zzzzzzt.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, the drill dived, and she turned her head sideways. Doosh. Just like before, the drill kept on diving left and right, and Faith turned her head to avoid it. She barely had any room to move.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;MMfff! Mmmmff!!&rdquo; Doosh. Doosh.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha ha!! Hah hah hah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Toya, in the chamber, is screaming in pain. Lanson, watching this, is growing worried. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s showing resistance.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Doctor A: &ldquo;What do we do now, sir?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Inject more drugs.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Doctor A: &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s dangerous for our subject.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lanson: &ldquo;If he wakes up and blows us up, that&rsquo;ll be dangerous for us. Inject the drugs!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Within the machine, a needle poked into Toya&rsquo;s arm. And he relaxed a bit.</p></p>

<p><p>While in a dark prison cell, Clyne sighs. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s with the long face, mate?&rdquo; asked his next door neighbor.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in the same situation as me, huh?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yep. The name&rsquo;s <strong>Silver Nitrate</strong>. I&rsquo;m from planet M-16, and I wanted to come to earth for a visit, but I got caught. The <strong>Galactic Police Force</strong> is getting tougher and tougher.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My name is Jonathon Clyne&#8230;and I&rsquo;m a sayan.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ohhh, one of those, eh?&rdquo; Silver said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My native name is Tyrus Menias. And I was caught because I was betrayed by one of my employees.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What a bummer, huh?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. I still have a score to settle with the one who framed me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So what are you going to do? Break out?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I can. But if I do so, I will be even more of a criminal. I just don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Silver was peeling a potato. &ldquo;Heh, such indecision from a president of a company? If I know sayans, they&rsquo;ll defend their honor no matter what.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>And Clyne already made a decision. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve decided.&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t belong here. I need to clear my name.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Good luck to ya, Johnathon. No, Tyrus.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Clyne is going to get out of this place on way or another. And he&rsquo;s going to find Asruel and bring him to justice and clear his own name. He is still unaware of what Asruel is doing with the stolen money &ndash; funding the Super Sayan Project. Will Clyne have to face off with Dexteria? And what will happen to Sakume?</p></p>

<p> <p>Liana came into the room with a wet cloth. Sakume was unconscious on her bed. She put the wet cloth on his head and he moaned slightly. He was wearing no shirt because she had to bandage him. He was sweating all over.</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume is just an ordinary guy with a not-so-ordinary background. He&rsquo;s the Executive Marketing Director for Z-Corps, a company that produces exo suits. His job is an important and demanding one, as it requires a brilliant mind to do what he does.</p></p>

<p><p>And he wonders how he got into this mess. Liana found him lying on the floor, bleeding and barely able to move. He&rsquo;s her friend so she took him in and has been taking care of him ever since. Liana also works at Z-Corps, but she&rsquo;s just a regular cubicle employee.</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume formed a shield. Toya&rsquo;s charge was done, and he fired. Kaboom! Nearly the whole ground blew up. Chunks and chunks of rocks floated. As for Sakume, he fell somewhere; he didn&rsquo;t even know what the hell happened. &ldquo;Ugh&#8230;uhhh&#8230;&rdquo; He got up, and Dexteria was in front of him. &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Whack! He was kicked, and sent flying backwards, and Dexteria flew up to hit him just before he fell. Kapow!</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;There is no way you can win. Please leave.&rdquo; Dexteria said. He walked away from the crispy, burning Sakume.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Damn you&#8230;Toya&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume just woke up, and he was sweating heavily. It was a pretty bad defeat from Toya&#8230;or Dexteria. They&rsquo;re the same person. He was tricked. Sakume was angry and depressed. And here he was, thinking he finally found a good friend. Maybe even a best friend. So much for that.</p></p>

<p><p>He sat up and just stared down. Liana came into the room. &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re awake. You took some pretty bad hits there.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Liana&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been fighting, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Liana.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She was surprised to hear these words. The way he said, it&rsquo;s like he just met her. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly.&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re friends, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>After putting a wet cloth on his head, Liana left the room. Sakume is truly grateful for Liana&rsquo;s help. And he knows she likes him. But he can&rsquo;t return the favor. He can&rsquo;t stay here any longer. Despite his injuries, he has to go train. Train to defeat the super sayan named Dexteria.</p></p>

<p><p>Liana came into the room with a glass of water. The room was empty. The wind blew hard against the curtains. Liana is disappointed and a little angry that he left without telling her. &ldquo;Sakume, you idiot.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Silver was peeling a potato. &ldquo;Heh, such indecision from a president of a company? If I know sayans, they&rsquo;ll defend their honor no matter what.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>And Clyne already made a decision. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve decided.&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t belong here. I need to clear my name.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Good luck to ya, Johnathon. No, Tyrus.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was tied to a big, around, golden platform &ndash; a giant coin. Ribbons covered just enough of her body, and her arms and legs were tied to it. The coin was on some sort of catapult machine.</p></p>

<p><p>She was breathing hard, scared of what will happen to her next.</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel was standing next to the lever. &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s an experiment, shall we? Let&rsquo;s test our luck. I&rsquo;m gonna flip the coin in the air &ndash; along with you! And your life will depend on how it lands! Ha ha ha ha! If it&rsquo;s heads &ndash; you live, but if it tails, then you die!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mmmmmff! Mmmmfff! Mmff!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He pulled the lever, the coin launched into the air, and Faith screamed for her life.</p></p>

<p><p>Wham! It landed right side up, and she was on the top. Still alive.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My my, it looks like luck is on your side.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith waited in horror for Asruel&rsquo;s next stage of torture. Maybe she&rsquo;s better off dead.</p></p>

<p><p>Now, the coin was vertical. Faith was tied to it, and awaiting her doom. Asruel had a blindfold on, and he was holding some knives. He threw one at her. Twang! She winced with tears. It went under her arm. He threw another one. Twang! It landed next to her head. Then another. Twang! Twang! Faith moaned and cried the whole time. They went to various parts of the coin, around her body. One of them went between her legs, and she moaned loud.</p></p>

<p><p>Before they knew it, knives were all over her body&rsquo;s outline. Asruel took off his blindfold, and smiled. &ldquo;Heh, I still got it in me. I still have my skills.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume removed the bandages from his body. Not that he&rsquo;s cured, but he knows that sayans heal fast. Faster than other races, at least. He is now at the training grounds of the temple, the place where he used to train. There is nobody here and it is quiet and peaceful. The perfect conditions for training and self-reflection.</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume stands in fighting position and begins to train. He screams and jump kicks the air. Whoosh.</p></p>

<p><p>A grueling battle just ended. Tyrus goes over to Sakume Keller, whose sayan name is Shikura Kanus, and shakes his hand. &ldquo;The battle is over. I must say, it is a job well done. You and your men fought your best.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, commander.&rdquo; replied Shikura.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The battle may be over, the war is not won yet.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ah, those were the good times and bad times. Good or bad, they are his past. Earth&rsquo;s environment is much better than that of Arlia&rsquo;s, living up to its name of &ldquo;The Land of Paradise.&rdquo; Images of Arlia are nostalgic to Keller. The battlefield. The smell of the air. The barren wastelands. It&rsquo;s a past that he&rsquo;s proud of, yet ashamed of at the same time. The reason he came to earth is to start over and live a new life.</p></p>

<p><p>But now he may have to return to his old life. A life of fighting. Because his commander&rsquo;s identity has been uncovered and falsely accused of stealing money from the company. Yes, he&rsquo;s a sayan, but he is not a thief or a corrupt president. In fact, it is the accuser who is the guilty one. The one named Asruel. Somehow, Asruel knows about Clyne&rsquo;s identity. And his bodyguard is Dexteria, a super sayan. Asruel is a smart son of a bitch.</p></p>

<p><p>Keller closed his eyes for a moment to remember the training he received in his homeland. He has not fought a serious battle for years, so he&rsquo;s going to be rusty. But his muscles remember well. While in darkness, he thinks about all the moves that he performed during his training. And he begins to move his body as he sees his image moving, with his eyes still closed. Whoosh! He punched the air. Whoosh! He did a high kick.</p></p>

<p><p>Ah, yes. it&rsquo;s all coming back to him now.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was still being tortured. Now, Asruel made the ceiling laser point between her legs. Faith moaned and groaned. He set the machine to auto, and the laser continued to move up, going for her vital spot. It was moving super slow, and it was an agonizing thing to wait for death. To the left, a saw was cutting through the table, and it&rsquo;s eventually destination was her neck. And there&rsquo;s another saw from the left, and it&rsquo;s cutting through the table, going in a straight line for her stomach. And another saw going for her breasts. And Faith looked up, and there was saw ready to cut her head in half. Not one, but many ways to die.</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel laughed at her suffering. &ldquo;Well&#8230;it was nice knowing you. See you later.&rdquo; And with that said, he left the room.</p></p>

<p><p>And now, Faith is screwed. She&rsquo;s completely defenseless &ndash; tied up and naked. And facing death in the eye. Poor, poor Faith. Left all alone and defenseless, just moments away from death. Can there be no crueler fate than this?</p></p>

<p><p>Kaboom! Clyne escapes the prison. The alarm rang throughout the facilities. Galactic enforcement officers chased him. He ran down a hill and slid into the river. The river leads to the sewers. Once he gets in there, his chances of escaping will be higher. It&rsquo;s smelly and dirty, but it&rsquo;s nothing compared to what he faced on Arlia. At one point, he had to crawl through a bunch of dead, bloody bodies. Some of those bodies were his comrades. But now is not the time for grieving.</p></p>

<p><p>The officers came to a crossroads. &ldquo;Which way did he go?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s split up!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume, wearing fighting clothes, comes to Leon Asruel&rsquo;s mansion. This time however, he&rsquo;s not in the mood to talk. He&rsquo;s going to talk with his fists. He jumps over the front gate and walks to the pool. Lanson was enjoying the sun, but seeing an unwelcome guest, he stood up. &ldquo;What the hell do you want, Keller? I thought my boss told you to leave?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Step aside.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lanson grabbed him by the collar. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume wasted no time and knocked his hands away and hit him in the stomach. Thud. Lanson groaned in pain. Sakume kicked him into the pool. Splash.</p></p>

<p><p>Other guards came up to him and attacked. Sakume beat them up. Kapow! Wham! More of them came. Sakume flew up to the roof. The guards have no way to get him up there so they fired their guns. Bang! Bang! Sakume threw an energy ball at the ground and blew them away. Kaboom.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You are still here?&rdquo; said Dexteria.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Toya&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You should not have come back. I have orders to protect the mansion. Now I have to kill you. It&rsquo;s nothing personal.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmph. And I thought we were friends.&rdquo; Sakume powered up. Froom!</p></p>

<p><p>Dexteria powered up and turned into a super sayan. His hair became gold and flashy. He ran down the roof with energy balls in his hands. Sakume jumped over him and landed behind him. Dexteria turned around and threw the balls. Shikura knocked them away. Bam!</p></p>

<p><p>Dex fired a beam, and Sakume gasped. He flew to the air. Dexteria appeared behind him and whacked him on the back. Whack!</p></p>

<p><p>On the other side of the mansion, Clyne fought the guards to make his way in. He broke down the door and came in. He saw anther door on the wall and kicked it down. It led to a staircase. He walked down into the darkness, not knowing what to expect. And what he found surprised him. It was a secret laboratory of some sort. Clyne was astonished by what he&rsquo;s seeing. Lots of computers and wires and pipes. And there is a glass chamber. The &ldquo;subject&rdquo; is supposedly being experimented inside this chamber.</p></p>

<p><p>Clyne walked to the inscriptions. &ldquo;The S-Project? What in the world?&rdquo; So, he finally figures it out. This is what Leon did with the company&rsquo;s money. For his sick little project. Looking at the table, Clyne found drugs and other painkillers. For some reason, he became angry and banged his fist on the table. He&rsquo;s angry that he did not discover this sooner. He should&rsquo;ve fired Leon ages ago.</p></p>

<p><p>Then he gasped when he heard machine sounds coming from the other room. And sounds of groaning. It sounds like a woman is in trouble. He quickly went to the next room and gasped as he saw Faith about to be slaughtered by a bunch of machines. A laser is moving on the table, moving between her legs, going slowly up. And it&rsquo;s almost there. A saw was eating its way through the table, going for her stomach, and another saw going for her neck. A saw from the seeing is slowly descending toward her breasts. Faith shut her eyes and shed streams of tears. This is not how she wants to die.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Faith!!&rdquo; he yelled.</p></p>

<p><p>Her eyes opened and she moaned, begging him to save her. He went to the computers and button mashed. &ldquo;Come on, damn thing!&rdquo; He got frustrated and broke the computer. Smash. Zzzzzzzt.</p></p>

<p><p>All the machines stopped. Faith panted for breath. She was this close to death.</p></p>

<p><p>Clyne quickly went to her. &ldquo;Ms. Faith, are you okay?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She nodded with tears coming down her face. The man she respects has saved her and she&rsquo;s glad. Clyne noticed that she was naked and wearing nothing but ribbons. It must be that bastard Asruel&rsquo;s doing. But now is not the time to be staring at her body. He removed the panties from her mouth and threw it away. He untied her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&#8230;I should&rsquo;ve gotten here sooner.&rdquo; said Clyne.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith buried her face in his chest and cried and sobbed. Clyne hugged her tightly, knowing she&rsquo;s suffered a lot. This poor girl has been through hell ever since he went to jail. He secretly cursed Leon. He promises he will not let Leon hurt anyone again. Ever.</p></p>

<p><p>Clyne removed his black jacket and put it on Faith. She looked at him and smiled. &ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; he said, getting up.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith smiled and nodded obediently. He took her hand and they leave the lab.</p></p>

<p><p>Clyne and Faith walk about the premises of the mansion. They were hiding behind a wall, making sure no one sees them. Clyne checked the surroundings. It&rsquo;s safe. He held her hand and they walked along the wall. Faith was wearing a black jacket and nothing else underneath. She feels exposed and vulnerable, but as long as she&rsquo;s with Mr. Clyne, she feels safe. Clyne, hearing fighting sounds, signals her to duck. He ducks and peers from the wall.</p></p>

<p><p>Kapow! Shikura got punched in the face. He wiped his mouth and charged at Dexteria. They exchanged moves. Wham!</p></p>

<p><p>Clyne: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Sakume! I have to go help him. You stay here okay?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was scared, but she had to trust him. She nodded.</p></p>

<p><p>Sakuma was knocked on the floor.</p></p>

<p><p>Toya: &ldquo;Goodbye.&rdquo; He gathered energy and fired a beam.</p></p>

<p><p>Just as Sakume thought he was a goner, Clyne jumped in and blocked the beam.</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume: &ldquo;Mr. Clyne!?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Clyne: &ldquo;I still have to prove my innocence.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Toya: &ldquo;Hmph. Then I have to kill you too.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume: &ldquo;Be careful, sir. He&rsquo;s a super sayan.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Clyne replied. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; He powered up. &ldquo;Hyaaaah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Toya smiled. &ldquo;What can you do against me?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s been a while since Tyrus fought, but he still remembers the fundamentals. Dexteria opened his palm and gathered energy. Tyrus got ready and jumped up high. Dexteria fires. Bam! Tyrus is over the beam and punches Dex in the face. As a result, he was knocked into a statue. Crash!</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume was amazed at that move. Looks like Tyrus still has some fight left in him.</p></p>

<p><p>Dexteria got up and grunted. He was not hurt at all. Clyne was shocked.</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume got in front of Clyne. &ldquo;Let me do this, commander.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Clyne. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re exhausted. Let me handle this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Dexteria did not wait for them to agree. It doesn&rsquo;t matter to him who takes him. He fires an energy ball, they jumped away. Bam! A statue was destroyed.</p></p>

<p><p>Clyne fires an energy ball, Dex floats up. Clyne flies up and shoots beams as Dexteria dodges. Whoosh. Whoosh. They hit each other in the air. Wham!</p></p>



<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="S_II_B">[B] - The Fight </span></p></center>

<p><p>Faith watched the fight with much worry. She wished she could help, but she doesn&rsquo;t know how to fight like they do. She can&rsquo;t fight at all. If only I was stronger, she said to herself, and secretly wished she can help Clyne in any way.</p></p>

<p><p>Kapow! Clyne was hit in the chin. Dexteria shows his super sayan powers. He is clearly superior to a regular sayan. Clyne is overwhelmed as he is knocked back to the ground. Wham! Dex opens his palm and shoots a bunch of fireballs. Clyne gets up and runs away. Bam! Bam!</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume: &ldquo;Commander!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith is getting more worried, seeing that Clyne is losing. (Mr. Clyne&#8230;) There is nothing she can do to help. She&rsquo;ll only get in the way.</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel showed up and Faith gasped. &ldquo;Well, if it isn&rsquo;t Faith.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith ran and Asruel grabbed her arm and slapped her. Smack! She was against the wall. &ldquo;No&#8230;no&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How did you escape?&rdquo; Asruel asked, putting his face close to hers. He held her arms to stop her resistance. &ldquo;Who let you out? It was Clyne, wasn&rsquo;t it? That son of a bitch is here.&rdquo; He kissed her lips.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s eyes were wide open with shock as he locked his lips into hers. She could do nothing to resist and stood there helplessly.</p></p>

<p><p>He grabbed her and threw her on the floor. Faith crawled backwards. Asruel approached and smiled evilly. His glasses fogged up. She was wearing nothing but a black jacket. Her legs are exposed and bruised.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aaaaaaah!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume heard Faith&rsquo;s scream and came. He grabbed Asruel&rsquo;s shoulder and punched him in the face. Kapow!</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel wiped the blood off his mouth angrily. No one has hit him like this for a while. &ldquo;Mr. Keller, what a surprise to see you here? Not only did you ignore my warning, but you came to my mansion a second time and even hit me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume: &ldquo;You deserved that one. I just realized it now. You&rsquo;re the one who accused the president while you did all embezzling yourself. You&rsquo;re the true culprit, Asruel!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The glasses guy laughed. &ldquo;So what if I am? What can you do about it? The law is on my side!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You son of a bitch. What have you done to Toya? Why is he working for an idiot like you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh. I did not bribe him or anything. He works for me on his own free will.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You lie!&rdquo; Sakume charged and punched, Asruel dodged and blocked, and when he saw an opening, counter attacked. Sakume jumped away. He&rsquo;s surprised that this guy can fight. And he&rsquo;s not an ordinary fighter, judging by the way he moves. So he&rsquo;s pretending this whole time.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith crawled against the wall and gasped in fear.</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume and Asruel did the stare. Suddenly, a beam exploded near them. Boom! Clyne landed. &ldquo;Sakume, Faith, let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel coughed from the dust and covered his mouth. &ldquo;Dexteria, you idiot. Don&rsquo;t destroy my mansion.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Dex: &ldquo;Then how am I supposed to kill them?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Clyne carried Faith in his arms and ran off, Sakume followed. When the smoke was cleared, they were gone.</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel: &ldquo;So they think they can escape? After them!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The good guys run and run until they were in some deserted mountainous area. No one is here to help them if anything should happen. Clyne put Faith down. He&rsquo;s been running for a while and he&rsquo;s out of breath, and so is Sakume. Even sayans get tired. &ldquo;We should be safe for now.&rdquo; said Clyne.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith: &ldquo;Mr. Clyne&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I am not Johnathan Clyne, Ms. Faith. I am sorry for misleading you. Asruel is right&#8230;I am a sayan, not an earthling. I am not the person you think I am.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith: &ldquo;That&#8230;that doesn&rsquo;t matter to me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Clyne looked at her eyes and she meant it. She hardly says anything, and these few words mean a lot to him.</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume: &ldquo;We better get going. That super sayan is on our trail. We can&rsquo;t stay in one place for too long.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It is too late for that.&rdquo; said Dexteria, standing on a rock. Everyone gasped.</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume: &ldquo;How did you find us so quickly?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel came out from behind Dexteria. &ldquo;You fool. He is different than you and Clyne. He is a special type of sayan whose abilities exceed that of a regular sayan. His sixth sense is as sharp as a knife.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Clyne: &ldquo;Why did you do this, Asruel? I always pay you well. What have I ever done to you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;You never paid any attention to me, Clyne.&rdquo; said the glasses guy. &ldquo;You never listened or appreciated my ideas. And besides, I hate sayans.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Then I have nothing more to say.&rdquo; Clyne and Asruel charged and attacked.</p></p>

<p><p>Dexteria turned super sayan and attacked, while Sakume defended. Pow pow pow. Sakume blocked the attacks to his face. Dex was moving too fast for him to even counter attack. Dex hit him in the stomach. Thud! It was a good one. Sakume scraped the ground and flipped a few times. &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Dex: &ldquo;I am sorry to have to do this. It&rsquo;s nothing personal.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>But I&rsquo;m glad you told me, Toya. I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m not the only one.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Toya: &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m glad you invited me here. I do not really have friends.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume thought he made a new friend. Although their time together was short, it was some of the best times he had. They meet up and talk about a lot of stuff that Sakume could talk to no one about. They have much in common. They&rsquo;re both sayan refugees, they like tennis, they like the same foods, etc.</p></p>

<p><p>But Toya&rsquo;s secret identity is a super sayan. One who works for Leon Asruel. He is not the &ldquo;good guy&rdquo; that Sakume thinks he is. Now, it&rsquo;s fight his friend or be killed. It&rsquo;s as simple as that.</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume powers up with blue energy. Dexteria and Sakume charged into each other. It&rsquo;s Dexteria&rsquo;s radiant gold energy against Sakume&rsquo;s vibrant blue energy. Kabam!</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel jabbed Clyne in the stomach and punched him in the face. Pow! Clyne got up and panted for breat. &ldquo;I underestimated you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Leon: &ldquo;There are a lot of things you don&rsquo;t know about me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Clyne: &ldquo;I am going to clear my name today!!&rdquo; He leaped at his opponent.</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel smirked and fired a beam as Clyne closed in on him. Bam!!</p></p>

<p><p>Clyne was on the floor, his clothes smoking from the hit. His vision became blurry.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha! I expected better from a sayan like you. You&rsquo;re just pathetic. I can&rsquo;t believe you really are Tyrus Menias, a former commander from the Great War.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Clyne was pissed off but he can barely move.</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel: &ldquo;They should call you Tyrus Patheticus. Ha ha ha!&rdquo; Then he looked at Faith. &ldquo;Hmmm.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith gasped as he came. She was frozen with fear. Two seconds later she snapped out of it and ran. Asruel grabbed her by the shoulder and pushed her on the ground. She crawled backwards in fear. Her eyes were shaking from fear and she&rsquo;s on the verge of tears. Asruel go on top of her and forced his lips into hers. Her fingers grabbed the dirt on the ground. Then he slapped her silly. Smack! Smack! She was half conscious from the beating.</p></p>

<p><p>Clyne: &ldquo;Ugh&#8230;no&#8230;don&rsquo;t hurt her.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel laughed perversely as he unzipped her jacket, revealing some cleavage. He unzipped it all the way to her stomach, revealing the area between her breasts. He licked her skin and she moaned.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Stop it.&rdquo; Clyne said as he stood limply.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aww, what&rsquo;s the matter? You don&rsquo;t like it when I&rsquo;m touching your woman?&rdquo; said Asruel, grabbing her chin and moving her head left and right. &ldquo;What can you do about it?&rdquo; He kissed her lips and tears drip down her face.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I said stop it!!&rdquo; Clyne yelled angrily.</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel smiled. He fired an energy ball and burned Clyne&rsquo;s chest. &ldquo;Aaaah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was head locked by Asruel and she can&rsquo;t do a thing. &ldquo;Mr. Clyne!&rdquo; she yelled with arm reaching out.</p></p>

<p><p>Leon saw the two energies collide in the sky. Bam! &ldquo;He&rsquo;s still not done yet? What&rsquo;s taking him?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Dexteria and Sakume landed.</p></p>

<p><p>Leon: &ldquo;Dexteria, what&rsquo;s taking you so long to kill him?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Dex is ticked off. &ldquo;Just let me do my job.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Leon: &ldquo;Hurry up will ya? Keller should be an easy kill for you. I didn&rsquo;t put all that money into you to be slow.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I know how to do my job.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Are you talking back to me?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume noticed that these two don&rsquo;t get along well. He took advantage of their distraction and jumped with a fist of energy. Dexteria reacted quickly and kicked him out of the way. Wham.</p></p>

<p><p>Leon was still holding Faith in a head lock. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about time. Now finish him off.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume&rsquo;s head was bleeding and he stared in awe as Dexteria is about to fire. Something is wrong. The energy is not coming to his hand. Dexteria&rsquo;s hand is shaking.</p></p>

<p><p>Leon: &ldquo;Hurry up, what are you waiting for?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Dex: &ldquo;I said don&rsquo;t tell me what to do you bastard!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Leon: &ldquo;What? It looks like you still need be taught some manners. Maybe another three days in a dark cell will teach you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Dex grabbed his head in pain. &ldquo;No&#8230;I will never go back there! Aaaaah!&rdquo; He released most of his energy as he screamed. &ldquo;AAAAAH!&rdquo; Everyone felt that shockwave. Dex was frantic. His eyeballs were shaking. He really hated the place called solitary. He spent days in that dark cell. Without light. Without human contact. He gathered an enormous amount of energy and fired at Asruel and Faith.</p></p>

<p><p>Leon gasped. He threw Faith into the path of destruction. She was on her knees and she winced from the bright light. She thought she was going to die for sure. Suddenly, Clyne got in front of her and took the beam for her. It hit his back and he coughed blood. Faith gasped.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay, Ms. Faith?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&#8230;you didn&rsquo;t have to do it!&rdquo; she shrieked with tears.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, really.&rdquo; he replied with pain in his voice.</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume can&rsquo;t believe his eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>Leon: &ldquo;Dexteria, you son of a bitch. You tried to kill me!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Clyne took out a knife and ran at Asruel and stabbed him in the stomach. Schleb.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;C-Clyne&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Enjoy your punishment in hell.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Leon fell backwards. Clyne walked away. But Leon is still alive. He takes out a gun and pulls the trigger.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith: &ldquo;Noooo!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Clyne collapsed. He can take a beam on the back, but a beam and a bullet? Not even a strong man like him can physically handle it. Faith ran to him. &ldquo;Mr. Clyne&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ms. Faith&#8230;I&rsquo;m s-sorry. I can&rsquo;t protect you anymore.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume went to his fallen friend. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t die. You can&rsquo;t die!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The dying man reached for Sakume&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been a great comrade *cough* and a loyal friend throughout the years. I will never forget you.&rdquo; With that said, he closed his eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume: &ldquo;No! Commander! Commander!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith shed tears of sadness and sobbed non-stop.</p></p>

<p><p>Asruel let out one final laugh, seeing his most hated enemy die. It&rsquo;s too bad he did it at the cost of his own life. He too closed his eyes for good. It&rsquo;s time to take a long, long nap.</p></p>

<p><p>The wind blew hard. Sakume&rsquo;s face is expressionless as he stands up. &ldquo;You see what consequences your actions lead to, Toya?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No one&#8230;tells me what to do.&rdquo; He opened his palm at Sakume. &ldquo;I will send you to hell with those two!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>So it has come down to this. Toya is not his friend. He was never his friend to begin with. It was Sakume who&rsquo;s the foolish one. Tyrus Menias is dead and he is pissed off. And Toya is responsible.</p></p>

<p><p>Toya fires a beam, Sakume jumps over it and attacks fiercely. &ldquo;Yaaah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Toya forms a shield and bounces him away. Toya continues to fire beams non-stop, exploding on the ground. Sakume back flips away from them. Bam, bam, bam. Toya is now on a frenzy and fires like there&rsquo;s no tomorrow. He&rsquo;s laughing manically, somehow thinking he will hit his target by luck. Bam, bam!</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume&rsquo;s speed saved him from all the explosions.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Toya&rsquo;s hair turned black for a second, then back to gold. &ldquo;What&#8230;what&rsquo;s happening? I&rsquo;m running out of energy? This can&rsquo;t be.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume came from behind. Toya turns around and kicks him down. Wham! Toya lands. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to get it!&rdquo; He powers up, but he has no energy left,</p></p>

<p><p>and his hair returns to normal color. He is no longer a super sayan, but a regular sayan. &ldquo;No&#8230;no!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>(Now&rsquo;s my chance.) Sakume gathers energy for the Wrath Beam and fires. Toya fires a beam into it, thinking he can win. But the Wrath Beam consumed the energy and hit Toya.</p></p>

<p><p>He screamed as everything turned white. &ldquo;Aaaaaaaaaaaah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume went back to Clyne&rsquo;s body. Faith was still crying. &ldquo;I killed the super sayan. It&rsquo;s all over now.&rdquo; Indeed it is over.</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume carries Clyne&rsquo;s body as he and Faith walk on the barren wasteland.</p></p>

<p><p>Everyone in the company is shocked over Johnathan Clyne&rsquo;s sudden death. Both Asruel and Clyne are dead and now there is no president. Everyone decided that Mr. Walter becomes the new president. The company is secure, but they grieve over Mr. Clyne&rsquo;s death.</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume goes to visit Clyne&rsquo;s grave and sees Faith. She puts a bouquet of flowers on it. He walked to the grave and the two just looked at each other and said nothing. The inscription said: Johnathan Clyne &ndash; a great man and a great fighter.</p></p>

<p><p>Sakume: &ldquo;Hey, do you think Mr. Clyne is in heaven?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith: &ldquo;Yeah&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>
