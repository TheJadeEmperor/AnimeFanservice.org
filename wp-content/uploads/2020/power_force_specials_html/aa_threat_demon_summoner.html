<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="a">[ A ] - The Prince From A Distant Land </span></p></center>

<p> <p>The <strong>Kingdom of Almerak,</strong> located north of the continent, is known for its peace and prosperity. Its king is a kind and loving soul, and never starts wars with other kingdoms, always doing what it takes to keep the peace. And the king has a beautiful daughter, the Princess of Almerak, who loves him very much. The father and daughter get along very well, and is said to uphold ideal family values.</p></p>

<p><p>At least that is how things appear to outsiders. Princess Faith just ran away from home, unable to deal with her father&rsquo;s tyrannical behavior. A search party has been sent out to find the princess, however, she is nowhere to be found.</p></p>

<p><p>Somewhere in the forest that borders the Sunrise Village, a young girl was sitting on a tree branch, waiting for her companion to return. She had just spent the night sleeping on the tree, and just awoke.</p></p>

<p><p><strong> Faith</strong> yawned and stretched her arms out. Ever since she ran away from home, she has not slept on a comfortable bed, or taken a decent bath. Not only that, but she&rsquo;s been wearing the same clothes all this time.</p></p>

<p><p>She wore a pink blouse with short sleeves, a perfect accessory for summer, a short pink skirt, and pink toeless shoes. She keeps a sword sheath in her back, under her blouse. All she has to do is reach her hand over her back to draw the sword out at a moment&rsquo;s notice.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry. Where&rsquo;s Marianne?&rdquo; Faith asked herself.</p></p>

<p><p>As she said this, her friend just returned. &ldquo;Hey Faith!&rdquo; yelled <strong>Marianna</strong>. She was holding a basket of fruits. Unlike her friend, Marianne was not born of nobility, but rather, she was born in a village on the outskirts of Almerak. Even though she came from a poor family, Marianna always has a positive outlook on life, and even became friends with the runaway princess.</p></p>

<p><p>Unlike the princess, who wears bright colors, Marianna wears dark colors. She has skinny black pants, a blue shirt, and always carries a patch of arrows on her back. She has long, silky hair of dark blue color.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Marianne!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Breakfast is here!&rdquo; She threw an apple and Faith caught it. Then Marianna jumped onto the branch and sat down next to her friend.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith took a bite out of the apple, and it was succulent and juicy. She&rsquo;s always thought that food found in the wilderness is bad for your health, but actually, it&rsquo;s pretty good. Being a princess, all her meals were prepared for her from morning till night. Faith had the best meals, prepared by top rated chefs.</p></p>

<p><p>But ever since she ran away from home, Faith has learned to appreciate living the simple life, the life of a commoner. Its moments like these that makes her appreciate life itself, eating a delicious apple on a tree, sitting next to her best friend.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the apple?&rdquo; Marianna asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s delicious!&rdquo; Faith exclaimed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Fruit tastes best when it&rsquo;s fresh.&rdquo; she explained.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You always know how to pick them.&rdquo; Faith continued to munch on the apple until it became a core. While they were eating, there was silence for a few minutes.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So, princess, what is our next destination?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The village closest to us is the Village of Sunrise. If we walk there now we should be there by the afternoon.&rdquo; said Faith.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sunrise? Isn&rsquo;t that the village that rumors say is being attacked by demons?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, and that&rsquo;s why we are going there.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Their conversation was interrupted by the sweet sound of a musical flute. The music was distant, yet their ears can hear the tunes clearly, and they became silent, waiting for the music to get louder.</p></p>

<p><p>So pleasant to the ears the music was that they were almost mesmerized by it. A man was seen walking down the path, playing the flute. As he came closer, the music grew louder. He did not see the girls on the tree branch, and continued along his merry way.</p></p>

<p><p>This man was dressed completely in black clothing. His face was young and handsome, with a fresh haircut, indicating he is no older than 20 years old. He also wore a cape, red in the front and black on the back. By the way he dressed, he is probably from a wealthy family, or a famous warrior. Judging by the fact that he carries a sword in his belt, he must be a swordsman from a wealthy family.</p></p>

<p><p>The young man opened his eyes and saw the girls sitting atop.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith clapped for him. &ldquo;That music was delightful.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You must be very talented.&rdquo; Marianna said.</p></p>

<p><p>He smiled. &ldquo;Thank you for your compliments, young ladies. It is my pleasure to meet your acquaintance.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The pleasure is ours. How can we greet you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The young man bowed. &ldquo;You may call me <strong>Darian</strong>. I have come from a far away land.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;A foreigner, eh?&rdquo; said Marianna. &ldquo;My name is Marianna.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;And I am Faith.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Faith?&rdquo; Darian repeated. &ldquo;What a wonderful sounding name, it is fitting for beautiful young lady like yourself.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you flatter me. Say, are you hungry?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well, I actually haven&rsquo;t had anything to eat since I woke up.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith grabbed an orange from Marianna&rsquo;s fruit basket and tossed it to him. Darian stared at the orange for a bit. &ldquo;Thank you. Listen, I am looking for Sunrise Village. Do you know where it is?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sure thing.&rdquo; said Marianna. &ldquo;Just go down this road, keep going straight ahead and eventually you&rsquo;ll see the village.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Thank for your generosity. I will be on my way now.&rdquo; Darian played the flute as he walked away. The further his distance, the lower the volume became, until it was inaudible.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What a well mannered gentlemen.&rdquo; Faith commented.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I think he likes you.&rdquo; Marianna said, elbowing her friend.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What? No he doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sure. He called you beautiful. And the way he looked at you, he was totally coming on to you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re imagining things.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sure. You&rsquo;ve never had a boyfriend, right?&rdquo;<br>  Faith blushed. &ldquo;Why are we talking about this?&rdquo; Suddenly, her expression grew serious. &ldquo;Still, he has an aura about him. He&rsquo;s definitely not a commoner. The way he dresses, and the way he carries himself, he&rsquo;s of nobility.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right about that. He&rsquo;s no ordinary man.&rdquo; Marianna replied. &ldquo;So he&rsquo;s going to Sunrise? I wonder what business he has there.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sunrise. That&rsquo;s the village we are going to.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ll run into him again.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith and Marianna arrived at the Village of Sunrise by sunset. The village was quiet and peaceful, unlike the busy city they used to live in. People were shopping at the marketplace, while some were done shopping and ready to go home. A bunch of little kids were playing tag, running past them, laughing without a care in the world.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Eh, so this is Sunrise?&rdquo; Faith commented.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite a contrast to the capital city, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Marianna asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine why demons would attack this place. This village is so peaceful.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a rumor, we don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo; said Marianna. &ldquo;Besides, we need to find a motel to stay in.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a small village, it doesn&rsquo;t look like they have a motel.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>An old woman with white hair approached them. She was a hunchback, holding a stick. &ldquo;You two are not from around here, are you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith and Marianna glanced at each other. &ldquo;No, we are from the capital city.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh my.&rdquo; the old lady exclaimed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve traveled a long way here. You must be exhausted.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well, kind of.&rdquo; Faith replied bashfully.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s about you stay over at my place tonight?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna waved her palms, saying, &ldquo;No, we wouldn&rsquo;t want to trouble you.&rdquo; Although, the truth is, it would be nice to stay at a house for once, instead of sleeping on hay every night.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith also jumped on the bandwagon. &ldquo;Yeah. I appreciate your kindness, though.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s no trouble at all. Young people are so modest.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith looked at her friend. &ldquo;Well&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I live alone, so I wouldn&rsquo;t mind having company over. It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve had guests in my house.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, old woman.&rdquo; said Faith.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna elbowed her friend in the arm. &ldquo;Faith, don&rsquo;t call her that. It&rsquo;s rude.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith quickly apologized. &ldquo;Oh! Sorry, miss...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The old lady smiled heartily. &ldquo;You can call me Tanae.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>So Tanae took the young women to her house. As expected of this village, this house is very primitive, its walls are made of wood, and its roof is triangular shape, made of wood and covered by straws.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith and Marianna kneeled over a bonfire. There was no furniture to sit on. The floor was just a mat over solid concrete.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please make yourselves at home.&rdquo; Tanae went into the kitchen and came back with a tin bowl of soup. She placed it over the bonfire.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for letting us stay here.&rdquo; Marianna said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No worries.&rdquo; The old woman laughed. &ldquo;Like I said, I haven&rsquo;t had company in a while. Since my husband died I&rsquo;ve been lonely.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; said Faith.</p></p>

<p><p>Tanae poured soup into their bowls. &ldquo;Drink it while it&rsquo;s hot.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The girls drank the soup, and judging by the looks on their faces, they enjoyed it.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So tell me about yourselves. Where are you from?&rdquo; Tanae asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re from the Capital City of Almerak.&rdquo; Faith replied.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Capital City? Oh my, that is a long way from here. You girls must be tired.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna then responded: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m used to it. I grew up poor so I travel a lot, going from town to town to find jobs.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tanae noticed they were carrying weapons. &ldquo;Capital city is a big place, full of people and full of life. What brings you to a small town like ours?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith took a sip of the hot soup. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve heard rumors that here are demons attacking the village.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ohhh. Are you two swordsmen?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna responded: &ldquo;You can say that. So, are the rumors true?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tanae got serious. &ldquo;Sometimes at night, people can hear strange voices coming from the woods. The voices aren&rsquo;t the voices of humans, they sound monstrous and bloodthirsty, as if they&rsquo;re out for human blood. One of the villagers found a trail of blood in the woods, not far from the village&rsquo;s south side. He heard growling sounds, and he got scared and ran away. Then he went back into the woods with a bunch of fighters, and a demon attacked them. It was only one demon, so they were able to handle it. They captured the demon, beheaded it, and burned its body.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;When did this happen?&rdquo; asked Faith.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Just last week.&rdquo; Tanae answered.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Last week?&rdquo; repeated Faith. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fairly recent.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, they heard a loud ringing sound coming from a bell. *Ding Ding Ding* Everyone became alert.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna shouted: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The village is in danger. It&rsquo;s probably a demon!&rdquo; said Tanae. Faith and Marianna stood up and headed for the door. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go, it&rsquo;s too dangerous.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna answered: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry Miss Tanae, we can take care of ourselves.&rdquo; With that said, they left the house.</p></p>


<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="b">[ B ] - Demon Infestation </span></p></center>


<p><p>The villagers were frightened as the demons approached in groups. They were commoners who carried pitchforks and sticks, with no combat experience, this is a scary experience for them. They swing their weapons at the creatures, but it was no use, the creatures kept on advancing.</p></p>

<p><p>The demons were red-skinned creatures that resembled goblins. They can walk on two legs, and they have two arms, and like goblins, they have point ears, sharp eyes, and razor sharp teeth. They do not speak, they only growl and drool at the sight of their prey.</p></p>

<p><p>One of the villagers swings his pitchfork at the demon, the demon grabbed it and broke it in half. The village stepped back and tripped over a rock. The demon was about to attack, and he covered his eyes, fearing for the worst.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, an arrow hit the goblin&rsquo;s forehead and it died on the spot. The villager, surprised that he&rsquo;s still alive, wondered who threw the arrow. To his surprise, it was two women, one dressed in pink, the other in dark blue.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re the ones who&rsquo;ve been attacking the village and slaughtering innocent people?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What you&rsquo;re doing is unforgivable.&rdquo; declared Marianna.</p></p>

<p><p>The demons stared at their new prey and growled.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ll handle things from here.&rdquo; Faith announced.</p></p>

<p><p>The goblins charged at them, Faith slashed them. Marianna kept her distance, loaded her bow with arrows, and fired them. *Twang* As a skilled archer, she can shoot up to 3 arrows at once and all will hit their target. Not only that, but she can transfer her ki into the arrows, and the arrow will automatically lock on to the target, much like a heat-seeking missile.</p></p>

<p><p>*Slish* Faith just cut a demon&rsquo;s head off. One of them snuck behind her, but she is smarter than that to be ambushed from behind. She ducked and turned around, stabbing the demon&rsquo;s stomach.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna loaded up three more arrows and fired them, hitting demons near Faith. That is their strategy; Faith would slice the demons from the front, while Marianna would be her support from the back.</p></p>

<p><p>The villagers were astounded by the fighting skill of these girls. They don&rsquo;t even know who these young girls are, yet they are killing demons and saving the village.</p></p>

<p><p>They keep on killing the demons, but they are still coming out from the forest. Marianna and Faith were getting exhausted, and they had to step back, as the demons keep on coming at them.</p></p>

<p><p>Darian showed up and saw the girls fighting the demons. Without hesitation, he stepped in and joined the fight. After slashing a few of the creatures, he decided it would be best to use his secret weapon. He took out the flute from his waist and put it on his lips.</p></p>

<p><p>The tune he played was a pleasant one, one that would make you feel as if you&rsquo;re on an endless field of green grass, you&rsquo;re lying down, and looking up at the sky. It&rsquo;s very peaceful and quiet. But this tune is deadly for the demons, as it hurts their ears. It doesn&rsquo;t hurt people, however, as the frequency only damage&rsquo;s demon&rsquo;s ears.</p></p>

<p><p>The demons held their ears and cried out in agony. Unable to fight, Marianna and Faith took this chance to finish them off. With them practically disabled, they were lamb for the slaughter.</p></p>

<p><p>Meanwhile, a lurker in the trees saw what happened. He was a man dressed in dark blue clothes, but his face and his other features are concealed in the darkness. &ldquo;Ohh. This is will be of utmost interest to <strong>Lord Rubeus</strong>.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>After the last of the demons were taken care of, Faith and Marianna show their gratitude to Darian. &ldquo;Thanks, you saved us.&rdquo; said Faith.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to thank me. You would&rsquo;ve done the same.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna said: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you can use your music as a weapon?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my specialty.&rdquo; Darian replied. &ldquo;Not only can my flute play tunes, but it be used in the battlefield as well. This flute is one of a kind, you cannot find it anywhere. I can put my ki into the flute and use it as a weapon. I can control the frequency of the tunes so that only demons are affected by the music, not people.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wow, that&rsquo;s an amazing ability you have.&rdquo; Faith exclaimed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Thanks. I&rsquo;ve had this ability since I was little. I never go anywhere without my flute.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It turns out our destination is the same. And so is our objective.&rdquo; Marianna declared.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I came to Sunrise because I heard there&rsquo;s a demon infestation. I wanted to investigate to see what&rsquo;s causing this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Several villagers were injured, and they were taken to the hospital. It is just a tent with a bunch of beds inside. Doctors were treating some of the wounded, and the others waited for their turn. Faith and Marianna went into the tent. &ldquo;What are we looking for here?&rdquo; asked Marianna.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I just want to try something.&rdquo; Faith replied, picking a random patient. &ldquo;I have lost the ability to heal people. I know I have the power within me&#8230;but I don&rsquo;t know how to use it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That was a long time ago. Just forget it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The patient&rsquo;s leg was bandaged, but it was still bleeding. He was groaning unconsciously.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith put her hand over the guy&rsquo;s leg and closed her eyes. She looked like she was calm and at peace, as if she&rsquo;s done this many times before. Several minutes have passed and nothing happened yet. Faith started to sweat and her eyebrows frowned a bit.</p></p>

<p><p>Then she opened her eyes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna grabbed her friend&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Hey. Don&rsquo;t force yourself. If you can&rsquo;t do it, you can&rsquo;t do it. Nobody expects you to perform a miracle.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But I did it before&#8230;if only I knew how.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. It doesn&rsquo;t mean your ability is lost. It means your ability isn&rsquo;t developed yet. Maybe the time isn&rsquo;t right.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Many years ago, Faith and Marianna were kids, playing on the grass fields. They were no older than ten years of age, running around with their cute little bodies, full of innocence. Marianna chased a butterfly and she tripped on a rock and fell down. *Thud*</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna scraped her knee, and she cried really loud. &ldquo;Waaaah! Waaaah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith went to her friend&rsquo;s aid. &ldquo;Your knee!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It hurts!&rdquo; she yelled, tears flowing down her eyes. &ldquo;Waaah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hold on. I&rsquo;ll fix it for you.&rdquo; Faith put her hand over her friend&rsquo;s knee and closed her eyes. She concentrated all her ki into her palm and released it onto Marianna&rsquo;s knee. Faith&rsquo;s body was glowing during this process, and her hair was waving, as if she&rsquo;s powering up.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna sat there silently, in disbelief at what&rsquo;s happening. Her pain was decreasing, and before she knew it, the bruise was gone.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;There! All better!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wow&#8230;&rdquo; Marianna exclaimed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s amazing! How did you do that?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure&#8230;it&rsquo;s one of my gifts.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna jumped on her and hugged. They laughed and chuckled without a care in the world.</p></p>

<p><p>That was the first time Faith discovered that she could heal. At that time, however, she did not realize that she&rsquo;s different than normal people. The thought never crossed the mind of the ten year old child. Only years later did she begin to see the differences between herself and regular people. But ever since that time, she did not know how to use her healing ability, it was a complete accident that she did it to Marianna.</p></p>

<p><p>Perhaps it arises out of a need to help her best friend, who was in dire pain at the time. Since then, Faith has tried several times to heal people, but every time it was in vain.</p></p>

<p><p>So the two women went back to Tanae&rsquo;s house, Faith still mulling over her disappointment in her abilities. Marianna noticed that Faith is in a bad mood and she touched Faith&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry too much about it. You&rsquo;ve done more than enough for the village.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith forced a smile. &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tanae came into the living room. &ldquo;Oh by the way, we have another guest coming here, I hope you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; Marianna asked.</p></p>

<p><p>The door opened and Darian came in, and the women were surprised.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s you, the swordsman.&rdquo; said Faith.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh. I did not realize you had company.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The old woman smiled. &ldquo;I usually live by myself. But tonight we have many guests.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darian closed the door behind him. &ldquo;I hope I&rsquo;m not intruding.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Non-sense.&rdquo; remarked the old woman. &ldquo;You practically saved our village. It&rsquo;s the least I can do for you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna then said: &ldquo;Thank you for helping us out during the fight.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it. It&rsquo;s a gentlemen&rsquo;s duty to protect charming ladies like yourself.&rdquo; said Darian with an air of confidence.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna blushed a little. &ldquo;Charming? Oh you don&rsquo;t say.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting late now. If you don&rsquo;t mind I&rsquo;m going to my room to sleep.&rdquo; He went into his room.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna sat down next to Faith. &ldquo;Did you hear that, Faith? He called me charming.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith sighed. &ldquo;You get like that every time a man gives you attention.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the kind of man I want as a boyfriend. Someone well dressed, has good manners, and is good with the sword. Speaking of which, isn&rsquo;t it about time you find a boyfriend?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith blushed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous. I don&rsquo;t have time for love. I have to travel with my best friend and exterminate demons.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tanae laughed while covering her mouth. &ldquo;Ah the joys of youth.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna started to reflect on their new friend&rsquo;s identity. &ldquo;Still, there&rsquo;s something about Darian that says he&rsquo;s not a commoner. The way he speaks, the way he carries himself, he gives off his aura of a wealthy man. Maybe he&rsquo;s from a wealthy family. Maybe he&rsquo;s of nobility!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith nodded. &ldquo;Yes. There&rsquo;s definitely something mysterious about him. I&rsquo;m not sure how to put it, but something about his identity bothers me. He&rsquo;s hiding something from us. A big, dark secret he&rsquo;s carrying with him.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darian stood by the window and stared at the bright, round moon. He made a grimace, and clenched his fist. The moon reminded him of that fateful night. Yes, on that fateful night, the moon was just as bright and round as tonight.</p></p>

<p><p>In the Kingdom of Zaibach, screams of agony and death echoed throughout the capital city. Blood splattered on the walls, and blood splattered on the floor as people were being slaughtered by the dark army. Women, children, and the elderly &ndash; no one was spared, they were all killed in cold blood.</p></p>

<p><p>A devilish laughter is heard throughout the city, this voice seems to have pierced the sky itself. The one who&rsquo;s responsible for this massacre is standing on a tower, his cape blowing from the wind. Only his silhouetted figure is seen in the darkness, but one can see his red glaring eyes of hatred, it can even pierce the soul. Also standing on the buildings are Vega&rsquo;s four elite henchmen, each one of them has their own special abilities, and can destroy a city by themselves.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My prince, you need to escape now!&rdquo; said Darian&rsquo;s servant.</p></p>

<p><p> Darian turned around. &ldquo;My city is being destroyed and you expect me to run away?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The enemy is too strong!&rdquo; the servant replied.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I am not going to run away.&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;I am going to find out how strong Vega is, exactly.&rdquo; He donned his black cape and walked towards the city, where the emerging fires are.</p></p>

<p><p>Darian drew his sword and charged at Vega. &ldquo;Hyaaah!&rdquo; Vega blocked the blade with his bare arm, causing it break it in half. Darian was surprised. Vega punched him in the face, knocking him down. Darian got up, but Vega fired a beam at him, knocking him down.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s over for you, prince! Ha ha ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He opened his palm to fire. The servant blocked the attack for him. &ldquo;Run&#8230;Prince Darian&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No! Why!?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re our last hope&#8230;&rdquo; The servant fell down.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Nooo!&rdquo; Darian clenched his fist. Despite his anger and grief, he was powerless in this situation. Staying here will only shorten his life, so he did the next best thing, and by living on, he will not let his servant&rsquo;s sacrifice go to waste.</p></p>

<p><p>Prince Darian ran into the wilderness, gasping for breath. He turned around and watched in horror as his kingdom is being engulfed in flames. He has seen his kingdom from afar before, and it always looks beautiful and serene, but now, that image is completely destroyed by the reality he&rsquo;s facing. Everything that he has known is now in flames, burned to ashes. This image will be burned into his mind, it will become his source of revenge.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Vega, you son of a bitch!&rdquo; he yelled out. &ldquo;I swear&#8230;I will avenge my kingdom! Just you wait!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> Darian sat against the wall, holding his sword patch against his shoulders. Ever since he lost his home, he has been wandering from town to town, in hopes of getting revenge. Every night he sleeps like this, with his sword close to him. Fueled by hatred and anger, he hardly gets a good night sleep. But eventually, he does sleep because he&rsquo;s weary from all the traveling and fighting.</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="c">[ C ] - Demon Summoner </span></p></center>

<p><p>The one who was watching from the trees, known as <strong>Arkady</strong>, is an expert archer. He is a man with long blue hair, wearing black clothing, carrying a bag of arrows on his back.</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady walked into the room. Standing there was <strong>Ren</strong>, a fellow accomplice. Unlike Arkady, who is more traditional in terms of manners, Ren is teenage punk. He wears a red and white sweater with a picture of a flaming skull on the back. He wears a red cap, although sometimes he keeps it backwards. His jeans had holes on he knees, and his sneakers had untied shoelaces. His arms were muscular and his body had an athletic form.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I assume everything went well?&rdquo; Ren asked.</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;Not quite. We had some interference.&rdquo; Arkady replied.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Interference. Weren&rsquo;t you trained to deal with every scenario?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What obstacle can there possibly be to defeat a bunch of helpless villagers?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I have to report to Rubeus.&rdquo; Arkady replied.</p></p>

<p><p><strong>Rubeus</strong> came into the room. &ldquo;What is it that you have to report to me?&rdquo; He sat down on his chair and crossed his legs. His appearance suggests that he is the boss of the two, or perhaps even more, and one who is extraordinary in terms of intelligence and power. He dons a black cape over his black clothing. With long, shiny silver hair, and deep blue eyes, he has an intense look, much different than that of an ordinary human.</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady and Ren bowed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My lord. The demons that we sent to attack Sunrise village were defeated.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;Defeated? By the villagers?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, there were outsiders.&rdquo; said Arkady. &ldquo;They are swordsman, two women and one man.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So those three managed to slaughter the army of demons. They must be strong.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My lord, they pose a threat to us.&rdquo; Arkady declared.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be the one to decide that. Ren!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ren stepped forward. &ldquo;Yes Lord Rubeus.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Then Rubeus gave his instructions: &ldquo;Send more demons to attack the village. Arkady, I want to you monitor those swordsman and inform me about their abilities.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They both bowed and yelled out &ldquo;Yes my lord!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith came out of the house and stretched and yawned. She turned and noticed Darian standing on the roof by himself. Curiously, she decided to get his attention. Darian was focused on the rising sun. Faith tapped him on the shoulder, which surprised him, and snapped him out of his trance like state.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s you, Miss Faith?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Whatcha doing here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Just watching the sun.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How boring.&rdquo; she responded. &ldquo;You said you came from a far away land, right?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; He replied.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it like over there?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It was very peaceful. Just like this village.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What about your family? Don&rsquo;t you miss them?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darian remained silent.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I understand. You don&rsquo;t want to talk about the past. But you know what I discovered? It&rsquo;s better to express your feelings than to keep them inside. You&rsquo;ll feel better that way.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That depends on their personality, I guess.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I too have reasons for leaving home. I once lived in the Capital City of the kingdom. My life was peaceful&#8230;too peaceful. My father is really strict. I can&rsquo;t leave the palace without his permission. Often times he&rsquo;d yell at me. I couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore, so one day I left. I&rsquo;ve been away from home ever since that day.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Your father must have a tough job.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No kidding. Being the King of Almerak must be really stressful.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Then Darian turned around. &ldquo;Did you say&#8230;your father is the king?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yep. King Midas.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;d make you his daughter&#8230;the princess!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yep. Surprised?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&#8230;a little bit. The part that surprises me the most is that we just met, and you trust me enough to tell me your secret?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I find that if you want others to open up to you, you have to open up first. It&rsquo;s kinda like the golden rule.&rdquo; Faith smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure one day you&rsquo;ll drop your guard and open up to me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darian smiled.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, the town bell rings, interrupting their conversation. Both of them immediately jumped off the roof and ran to the tower.</p></p>

<p><p>The bell boy screamed &ldquo;Demons are coming!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darian and Faith saw people running away, so they ran towards the crowd, into the direction of the danger.</p></p>

<p><p>Villagers holding pitch forks fought the demons off, but they were not trained in combat, and they were fighting a losing battle. Marianna was already here, shooting arrows at the demons.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith and Darian arrived at the scene. &ldquo;They just keep on coming.&rdquo; Both of them drew their respective swords and charged into the front lines.</p></p>

<p><p>Using her usual moves, Faith sliced and diced the demonic creatures.</p></p>

<p><p>The villagers were relieved their help has arrived. Up until now they were putting up a brave front, but now their morale has gone up, and they&rsquo;re more motivated to fight than ever before.</p></p>

<p><p>*Slish* Faith just cut off a demon&rsquo;s head. She was about to charge into the next one, when a fallen demon grabbed her leg. She struggled to get free from its grip. A demon in front of her approached. Its claws were ready to shed some blood, its eyes were full of bloodlust, and its teeth were ready sink into some human flesh.</p></p>

<p><p>It ran at her. Faith shrieked, and stabbed the demon in the stomach. The demon fell down, taking the sword with him. Faith&rsquo;s leg was still under this demon&rsquo;s grip. She opened her palm and fired a beam at its head, blowing it up.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith then proceeded to retrieve her sword, etched into the demon&rsquo;s guts. She pulled hard, but it was stuck too deep. Suddenly, another demon came from the side and slashed, and luckily, she dodged it in time.</p></p>

<p><p>With no weapon to defend herself, she had to step back, avoiding the demon&rsquo;s claws. By doing so, she is moving further away from her sword, and that&rsquo;s not good. Her back hit a tree, and she realized she&rsquo;s surrounded by a group of six demons. They all had the same glaring eyes and talon-like claws.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna loaded an arrow into her bow and fired it. *Schling* It hit a demon in the forehead, piercing its brain, and it died standing up. Darian was busy hacking away in his area, his clothes were already stained with demon&rsquo;s blood. They both noticed that Faith was in trouble.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Faith!&rdquo; Darian yelled. He ran towards her, but two demons got in the way, and he grunted. &ldquo;Ugh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna put down her bow and drew her sword, and began hacking and slashing the demons, so she can rescue her friend. However, her impatience is not making her kill the demons any faster, as they take more than a few swings of her blade to finish them off.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s back was against a tree, and there was no where left to run. One of the demons leaped at her. She shrieked and fired a pink beam, completely destroying it. The other creatures continued to inch their way towards her.</p></p>

<p><p>Her heart beat rapidly, knowing that she was at death&rsquo;s grip. She has been in countless fights before, but never in a situation as dangerous as this one.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, something in her snapped, and the expression in her eyes changed. She grew angry and screamed out loud, releasing a shockwave. The demons felt it, and they remained still, not wanting to advance further. Faith&rsquo;s body began to glow, releasing a pink aura, and that aura turned into electricity.</p></p>

<p><p>Both Marianna and Darian felt the energy, and they stared at Faith. They were both surprised at what they saw, especially Marianna, who thought she knew Faith&rsquo;s strength.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&#8230;is this?&rdquo; said Marianna. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never felt anything like this from Faith.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith continued to release the electricity from her body, while clenching her fists. Her hair was waving from the winds generated by her energy. It looked as if she was a bomb ready to explode. But her body was unable to handle such a high energy output, and she grew exhausted, and the energy disappeared completely.</p></p>

<p><p>She fell on her knees and panted for breath. &ldquo;What&#8230;what happened?&rdquo; she murmured to herself.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna and Darian ran to their friend&rsquo;s aid. As the demons were about to attack Faith, they were killed by Marianna and Darian.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You okay?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine&#8230;I think.&rdquo; Faith replied.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What now?&rdquo; asked Marianna.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to use my flute. But while I&rsquo;m doing that I&rsquo;m vulnerable. You need to defend me.&rdquo; said Darian.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Roger that!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darian started to play the tune, the same one as last time. The demons covered their ears and howled in agony. Marianna killed all the demons near Darian. The demons eventually gave up and escaped into the forest.</p></p>

<p><p>Darian took a breath of relief. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s over&#8230;for now.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna spotted somebody in the trees. &ldquo;Stay here and watch Faith.&rdquo; She ran towards the tree. The silhouetted figure in the tree jumped away.</p></p>

<p><p>Darian shouted: &ldquo;Wait, where are you going?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The silhouetted figure continued to run towards the darkness, and Marianna could see that this man has blue hair, and he&rsquo;s wearing black clothes. While running, she drew her bow and arrow.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; she yelled.</p></p>

<p><p>The man stopped.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an expert archer, I can hit you even from this distance.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh. You must be pretty good.&rdquo; Arkady replied.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now tell me. Why were hiding in the trees? What do you have to do with the demons attacking us?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I wonder&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna waited anxiously for his response.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How accurate you are&#8230;Miss Expert Archer.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Just now, Marianna noticed that he also carried a bag of arrows on his back. Arkady suddenly turned around, bent down on one knee and aimed at her. They fired an arrow at the same time, and they jumped away to avoid getting hit. *Whoosh*</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady ran away from her, and Marianna chased him. They fired arrows while running, and they only hit trees. Both of them hid behind a tree.</p></p>

<p><p>For a few moments, there was complete silence. Marianna inched her head over to look. Suddenly, an arrow hit the tree. *Twang* She quickly titled her head away from it. The arrow was mere inches from breaking her skull, and she took a breath of relief.</p></p>

<p><p>Clearly, the opponent is a skilled archer like herself, and he&rsquo;s not to be underestimated. She decides it&rsquo;s time to use her signature move. Marianna jumped out of the way and loaded her arrow into the bow. She gathered spiritual energy from her body and put it into the arrow, and it started to glow a light blue color.</p></p>

<p><p>From a distance, Arkady was doing the same thing, gathering his energy into the arrow.</p></p>

<p><p>When Marianna was done charging, she opened her eyes, and released it. &ldquo;<strong>Celestial Arrow</strong>!&rdquo; The arrow was faster and more powerful than a regular arrow, it ripped through the air with its brilliant blue color.</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady fired his arrow. &ldquo;Demonic Arrow!&rdquo; His arrow glowed devilish red color and zoomed through the air.</p></p>

<p><p>Both arrows were heading directly towards each other, and Marianna and Arkady watched to see what would happen. Arkady&rsquo;s red arrow broke through Marianna&rsquo;s blue arrow, much to her surprise, and it hit the tree next to her. The arrow exploded upon impact, knocking her down.</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady took his chance to flee. Due to his speed, by the Marianna stood up, he was already gone.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna came back to where the battle took place, now filled with demon blood.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith went to check up on her best friend. &ldquo;Marianna, what happened?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I was chasing somebody. But he got away.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Chase who?&rdquo; Faith asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; she responded. &ldquo;But I think that man has something to do with these demons attacking the village. Although I&rsquo;m not sure how they&rsquo;re connected. Anyways, how are you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That was a close call, you know? You have to be more careful, Faith. You cannot heal yourself. What happened back there?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith stared at the ground. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure. When my life was in danger, I felt like I needed more power. And then something inside of me just snapped&#8230;it&rsquo;s as if there was some kind of barrier keeping my powers at bay&#8230;and then the barrier was released&#8230;I don&rsquo;t know how to explain it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Faith, you don&rsquo;t know how powerful you are. You have a lot of hidden power inside of you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&#8230;maybe it was just a fluke. I won&rsquo;t be able to do it again.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Anyways, let&rsquo;s get some rest. You&rsquo;re tired.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith nodded.</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="d">[ D ] - Rubeus's Plan </span></p></center>


<p><p>Arkady came into the dark room and kneeled. &ldquo;Lord Rubeus.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How did it go?&rdquo; asked Rubeus.</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady hesitated to answer, still ashamed at his own mistake. &ldquo;It did not go according to plan.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh? Don&rsquo;t tell me those swordsmen interfered again?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, my lord.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;They keep interfering with our plans.&rdquo; Ren ranted. &ldquo;What are they doing in Sunrise village anyways?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus contemplated on the situation. &ldquo;Hmm, two women and one man, eh? Something tells me they are no ordinary swordsmen. Very well then.&rdquo; He stood up. &ldquo;Our plans cannot wait any longer. The demons are supposed to kill the villagers, so I can collect their souls. Once I have enough souls I will be able to summon a high level demon. With that powerful demon under my control, I&rsquo;ll be the undisputed ruler of the land. &rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;But because of these swordsmen, our soul collecting has come to a halt.&rdquo; Ren said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we need to pay them a little visit.&rdquo; Rubeus stood up from his chair and walked slowly towards the two kneeling henchmen.</p></p>

<p><p>Both Ren and Arkady were surprised. &ldquo;You mean, you&rsquo;re going in personally, my lord?&rdquo; said Arkady. &ldquo;There is no need for you to get your hands dirty. I will fix this mess.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus walked past the two. &ldquo;You will not be able to handle this alone. We will leave in the morning.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Both Ren and Arkady bowed. &ldquo;Yes sir!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>As per Marianna&rsquo;s advice, Faith decided to take some time off and relax. So she went shopping around the marketplace. At noontime, the marketplace is extremely busy, filled with all kinds of people. It&rsquo;s surprising at the number of people that are here, considering it&rsquo;s a small village.</p></p>

<p><p>There were all kinds of things for sale, ranging from foods to clothing, to jewelry, to books and paintings. Faith came to the grocery store were there was fish at the front. The fish bodies were placed on ice to keep it fresh. Faith was learning a lot just from observing her surroundings. It&rsquo;s better than being cooped up in the palace all day long. That place is so boring, there are no fun things to do.</p></p>

<p><p>Being in the marketplace where goods are exchanged helps Faith get a sense of the economy. An instructor would teach her about the economics of a country, but those are just facts and numbers, and they&rsquo;re boring. It&rsquo;s a much different experience being in the action, than just reading numbers off a piece of paper. The princess is glad she made a decision to run away from the palace, to be able to see the world from a different light and experience all kinds of fun things.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna was practicing her archery in a training ground. *Twang* She just hit a bulls eye. Being an expert, and probably one of the best archers in the land, she is guaranteed to hit a bulls eye. She can even do it with her eyes closed. But in a fight, there are always variables to consider, such as the force of the wind, and there maybe obstacles in the way, such as trees.</p></p>

<p><p>She was still thinking about the encounter the other day with the blue haired archer, Arkady. She&rsquo;s never met anyone that skilled before, his skill rivals that of her own. It gives her more motivation to train.</p></p>

<p><p>While Faith was observing the fish, a man in a hood and cape was watching her. Arkady wanted to hide his face, because the other night, Marianna may have seen him. He loaded his bow and arrow and aimed at Faith&rsquo;s head. Being an expert archer, he can hit a target from 100 meters away, even if there are obstacles in the way. In a crowded marketplace like this, he can dodge all the people&rsquo;s heads and still hit his target...as long as he concentrates.</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady pulled the arrow back tightly against the string, waiting for the right moment to release it. To hit a target under all these conditions is tricky, but he can feel when is the right moment to fire. Faith was talking to the store owner, asking him questions about the fish.</p></p>

<p><p>When Arkady felt it was the right time, he released the arrow. Just then, Faith bent down to get a closer look. The arrow missed her head and hit the wall. *Twang* Everyone who saw that was shocked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tch.&rdquo; Arkady, realizing his mission has failed, turned around and left.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith saw the hooded man and knew he was the culprit. She ran past the crowds, pushing through people. It was inconvenient walking past this large crowd, but eventually she came to an open area. Arkady ran into the narrow alley between two buildings, and she ran after him.</p></p>

<p><p>The alley had only one path, which is to turn right, and Arkady turned right. After two more turns, he came to a dead end. He turned around, and Faith just showed up.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she demanded to know. &ldquo;Why did you try to kill me?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>At first he was frustrated that he&rsquo;s trapped, but then Arkady smiled. He took off his hood and cape and let it drop to the ground.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith drew her sword that she keeps on her back, getting into fighting position.</p></p>

<p><p>*Twang* Marianna just hit another bulls eye. She was about to load another arrow from her quiver, when she heard clapping. There was a strange man sitting on top of the wall.</p></p>

<p><p>*Clap clap* &ldquo;Very nice. As expected of someone who can slay demons.&rdquo; said Ren.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna looked surprised. (When did he get here? How was I not able to sense him?) &ldquo;Who are you?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ren swings his index finger. &ldquo;Tsk tsk tsk. Where are your manners? You should introduce yourself first before asking someone for their name.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have time for games. If you don&rsquo;t tell me now, I&rsquo;m going to shoot.&rdquo; She pointed the arrow at him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ohhh I&rsquo;m sooo scared.&rdquo; said Ren sarcastically.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; Marianna fired the arrow, and Ren vanished, and reappeared on ground level. &ldquo;I get it now. You&rsquo;re that guy&rsquo;s accomplice, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she said, referring to Arkady.</p></p>

<p><p>Ren was wearing cap, and the tip of it covered most of his face, except for his mouth. He smiled.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna knew he was up to something no good. Ren charged energy into his fist and punched the ground. A wave of energy came hurling in her direction, and Marianna braced herself for the impact. &ldquo;Kaboom!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady loaded an arrow into his bow and fired. Faith dodged it. *Whoosh* Arkady proceeded to fire another arrow, this time Faith slashed it to pieces with her sword. As quick as he is with the bow, Faith is quick with the sword, and she can block his attacks with ease.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Not bad.&rdquo; Arkady commented. &ldquo;As expected from someone who can slay so many demons in a single night.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Just by that comment, Faith had a hint about this man&rsquo;s identity. But there was no time to think in the middle of a fight.</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady gathered red energy into his arrow. &ldquo;Demonic Arrow!&rdquo; He fired it, and this arrow was different than the others, its speed is faster, and its power is greater.</p></p>

<p><p>This means nothing to Faith, however, because she has a way of countering this. She swings her blade so hard, that it caused a shockwave in the air, and this shockwave tore the arrow into pieces. The shockwave went all the way to Arkady, who jumped away to avoid it.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith jumped to the air and slashed Arkady&rsquo;s bow into pieces. They landed. Arkady drew his sword and faced his opponent. Arkady may have lost his primary weapon, but he is pretty decent with the sword. His swordsmanship puts him above most other swordsmen, one can say he&rsquo;s a genius when it comes to weapons and combat.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith and her opponent did the stare for a while. There was much tension in the air, a gust of wind came by, but both hardly noticed it.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, the wall came crashing apart, ripped apart by a power wave. Marianna fell on the ground. Ren came out from the wall.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Marianna!&rdquo; Faith yelled.</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady charged forward and they clashed on the blades. *Clang* They jumped away. Faith summoned a red rose from her left hand and used the Vine Whip technique. It is one of her special moves, where the stem of the rose extends to an indefinite length, and because of the thorns on the vine, it can be used as a whip to hurt someone. The vine tied up Arkady&rsquo;s wrist.</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady tugged his arm towards him, and the thorns pierced his skin. Faith charged forward and attacked - Arkady blocked, but Faith broke his sword, and slashed him on the chest. Arkady jumped back and winced from the pain.</p></p>

<p><p> Ren put his palms together and fired a shockwave. Marianna vanished, and reappeared on the side, where she was within striking distance of Ren. Her opponent quickly stopped the shockwave and jumped away as Marianna struck him, slashing his arm.</p></p>

<p><p>Ren and Arkady stood together side by side in their fighting stances. Likewise, Marianna and Faith stood side by side. Suddenly, the heroes sensed a strong ki approaching. Ren and Arkady moved apart when Rubeus walked in between them.</p></p>

<p><p>Just by looks alone, Faith could tell he is no ordinary man. In fact, he is probably not even a man, perhaps a demon with hidden powers they&rsquo;ve never seen before. Donning a cape that&rsquo;s black on the outside and purple on the inside, a robe with wide open sleeves, black leather pants, and a shiny pearl necklace, his appearance suggests he is a sorcerer.</p></p>

<p><p>His cold blue eyes and his silver hair give him the impression of youth and power, and there was a commanding presence about him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Faith asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How rude.&rdquo; Ren replied. &ldquo;You are looking at Lord Rubeus, the most powerful sorcerer in the kingdom.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Lord Rubeus is undefeated, and the fact he has shown up is your unlucky day.&rdquo; Arkady said.</p></p>

<p><p> Rubeus stared at the female warriors, and when he took a good look at Faith&rsquo;s face, he became surprised. (That face. I recognize it from somewhere.) &ldquo;So, you two are the ones who have been causing us so much trouble. I never expected it to be two pretty young women like yourselves.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna grunted. &ldquo;What do you mean causing you trouble? Your goons attacked us first!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>It is clear that her friend was angry, but Faith tried to remain calm. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me...You&rsquo;re trying to stop us from fighting the demons.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus smiled. &ldquo;That is correct. It took me a lot of energy to summon those demons. It would be troubling if you kept killing them.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a demon summoner? You&rsquo;re the one who&rsquo;s trying to destroy this village?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Unforgivable!&rdquo; Marianna exclaimed, clenching a fist.</p></p>

<p><p>Both Faith and Marianna charged forward in a burst of rage. Rubeus gathered energy into his palm and released a shockwave, knocking them both down. *Wham*</p></p>

<p><p>The injured Faith got back on her feet.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you can still stand after that? Impressive.&rdquo; Rubeus complimented.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith wanted some answers. &ldquo;Why would someone like you try to destroy this peaceful village?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmph.&rdquo; Rubeus retorted. &ldquo;Good question. More importantly, what is the Princess of Almerak doing in a place like this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Everybody was shocked when they heard this.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the princess?&rdquo; Ren exclaimed.<br>  &ldquo;This little girl?&rdquo; said Arkady.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna&rsquo;s eyes widened&ldquo;Crap! How does he know?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus looked like he was in deep thought. &ldquo;Yes...I can remember that face from anywhere. There is no doubt about it, you are Princess Faith of Almerak.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Everyone waited for her answer, and the few seconds of silence that followed were tense. Finally, she spoke up. &ldquo;I knew the name Rubeus had a familiar ring to it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You know him?&rdquo; asked Marianna.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t exactly say I know him. A long time ago I met him at my father&rsquo;s party...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A long time ago, King Midas held a royal banquet where all the nobles, rich folks, and government officials from across the land attended. It was the ultimate high class party to attend, only those of superior social status and birthright may be present at this party.</p></p>

<p><p>As people were sipping their wine and chatting, King Midas and others followed him as he came down the staircase. Amongst those behind him were his personal servants, as well as his only daughter, Princess Faith. She was wearing a large pink dress, shaped like an umbrella. She usually wears pants or a skirt, so this dress was uncomfortable and she felt like she could trip over it at any moment.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus was drinking wine and talking to some people. At the time, was a noble who served in the military. At the party, he was wearing the same clothes as he is now, long purple pants, a dark purple vest, and a cape of the same color.</p></p>

<p><p>He walked over to Midas. &ldquo;It is an honor to meet you, your highness.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Likewise, Lord Rubeus.&rdquo; They shook hands.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus then noticed Faith. &ldquo;This must be...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is my daughter, Faith Midas.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith bowed politely, kneeling a little, pulling the sides of her dress with her hands. &ldquo;Nice to meet you, Lord Rubeus.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard rumors of your beauty, but nothing compares to seeing you in person.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith blushed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too kind.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Rubeus is a noble who has made contributions to the kingdom&rsquo;s military. He is even serving actively himself as a lieutenant.&rdquo; said Midas.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Faith replied blankly. &ldquo;That is quite impressive.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>At the time, Faith suspected that Rubeus is more than meets the eye, but thought nothing of it. There was something about his demeanor and appearance that gives it away, the fact that he is no ordinary noble. Those milky blue eyes, that young face, that long, silver hair, and purple outfit makes him stand out against all the other gentlemen.</p></p>

<p><p>Back then, she was too inexperienced to tell who is trustworthy or not. Faith&rsquo;s intuition is usually correct. The sixth sense is the ability to summon ki and control it, but some say that one&rsquo;s intuition, or &ldquo;hunch&rdquo; is the true sixth sense.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who knew that Lord Rubeus is just a lowly criminal?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus laughed. &ldquo;Criminal? My dear, you don&rsquo;t understand a thing. You don&rsquo;t see the greatness of what I have planned.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just a murderer!&rdquo; Faith summoned a bunch of roses and threw them at him. Rubeus opened his palm and burned the roses, turning them into ashes before him.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was taken aback by his power. Her attacks don&rsquo;t work on him, so what can she do now?</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmmm. To think I&rsquo;d run into the princess at a place like this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t underestimate me just because I&rsquo;m a princess.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Are you running away from home? What would your father think?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Darian came by, walking into the conversation. Rubeus saw him and instinctively felt hatred towards him. &ldquo;Rubeus&rsquo;s power is too much for you. Let me handle this, ladies.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus smirked. &ldquo;What can you possibly do?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darian and Rubeus drew their swords, and leaped into each other, clashing their blades. They hit several times in the air and landed on a rooftop, where they continued their fight.</p></p>

<p><p>Naturally, Faith and Marianna continued their fight with Rubeus&rsquo;s henchmen.</p></p>

<p><p>Darian and Rubeus jumped to the air and clashed their blades, going past each other, and landed. Darian felt a jolt of pain on his stomach. Rubeus turned around and smirked. &ldquo;All that tough talk, and this is all the power you have?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I have no choice.&rdquo; Darian said to himself. &ldquo;I have to use this.&rdquo; He drew the flute from his cape and started playing his favorite tune.</p></p>

<p><p>At first Rubeus thought it was just music, but then his ears started to hurt. His hands covered his ears but it was no use, the music pierced his ears and entered his brain directly. His music is especially effectively against a demon like Rubeus.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Agh...what is this sorcery?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady and Ren stopped fighting. &ldquo;Lord Rubeus is losing? How can this be?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of here!&rdquo; said Ren. Arkady nodded and they jumped away.</p></p>

<p><p>Darian continued to play the flute as Rubeus groaned in pain. He fired an energy ball at Darian&rsquo;s feet, distracting him for a moment, giving Rubeus the chance to escape.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Marianna and Faith show up. &ldquo;Darian. Well done.&rdquo; Faith complimented.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He was a tough opponent.&rdquo; said Marianna.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s indeed a powerful sorcerer.&rdquo; Darian added. &ldquo;But at least I know his weakness. He will not be a threat to us.&rdquo;</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="e">[ E ] - Temple of Woes </span></p></center>


<p><p>The company of three went back to the house to take a break from all the action. Marianna and Faith are tired from fighting, as well as exhausted from all the traveling, and Darian feels the same way.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna handed Faith a cup of water. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; she replied, and gulped it down.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who would&rsquo;ve expect you to run into an old enemy in this village?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I myself was surprised at the development.&rdquo; Faith replied.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Say. If you&rsquo;re tired of traveling...you can always go back home.&rdquo; said Marianna.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be a prisoner in my own castle. Back home, I have no freedom whatsoever. Out here...it&rsquo;s dangerous and exciting at the same time. It&rsquo;s fun.&rdquo; Faith smiled.</p></p>

<p><p>Her smile puts Marianna at ease. Deep down inside, she was hoping Faith would say that. After all, traveling is more fun with a companion, traveling alone doesn&rsquo;t feel the same.</p></p>

<p><p>Everyone gathered at the living room at Darian&rsquo;s request. Tanae and her three guests kneeled on the floor in front of the bonfire.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How are you two feeling?&rdquo; Darian asked Marianna and Faith.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re fine.&rdquo; Marianna replied. &ldquo;Thank you for your concern. So...what will you do now?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Rubeus is a dangerous foe. But after today&rsquo;s incident, I do not think he will be coming back to this village.&rdquo; said Darian.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I feel the same way.&rdquo; Faith replied.</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;Since he is responsible for the demons appearing, I think the problem has been solved... for now. I am going to pursue Rubeus to make sure he doesn&rsquo;t attack other villages.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna was against his idea. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to chase him by yourself? That&rsquo;s reckless!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Even if your flute is the only thing that can defeat him, it&rsquo;s reckless to take him on by yourself.&rdquo; Faith and her friend are in complete agreement on this issue. Even though they just met Darian recently, they feel that he is a trustworthy friend. &ldquo;Besides, you don&rsquo;t even know where he ran off to.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You all have done well protecting our village. We owe you a great deal.&rdquo; said Tanae with a hearty smile.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith blushed at her compliments. &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t think anything of it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tanae then changed the topic. &ldquo;By the way...our village isn&rsquo;t the only one that&rsquo;s been attacked by demons. I heard rumors of a temple down south that&rsquo;s infested with demons.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna suddenly remembered hearing about it in the news. &ldquo;Is it the Buddhist temple that&rsquo;s near the mountains?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tanae nodded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why one ever goes there. I think that could be your next clue.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna got into thinking pose. &ldquo;Are these demons attacking villages and temples on purpose? I thought they were mindless, bloodthirsty creatures who attack randomly.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of sorcerers who can open portals to the demon world and summon lower level demons.&rdquo; Faith said. &ldquo;These demons have to obey the sorcerer and do their bidding. These sorcerers have a high power level. Someone like...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Rubeus!&rdquo; exclaimed Darian. &ldquo;He is most likely the one responsible for all these attacks. It&rsquo;s settled then. I will not stop until he&rsquo;s defeated.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I knew that one day you&rsquo;d have to leave. Be sure to take care of yourselves.&rdquo; said Tanae.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I will. You take care.&rdquo; Faith said, hugging the old woman.</p></p>

<p><p>Then it was Marianna&rsquo;s turn to hug her. &ldquo;Thank you for your hospitality.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>So Darian, Marianna, and Faith said their goodbyes to the humble old woman, and set off on their next journey. Although their time spent with Tanae was short, they will always remember her for the kind, old woman that she is.</p></p>

<p><p>So the company of three traveled on foot to their next destination, which is the temple that Tanae mentioned. To do that, they have to go through a forest located south of the village, and the temple&rsquo;s entrance is on the other side of the forest.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was worried that they might get attacked by demons in the darkness of night, but luckily, nothing happened. The most they got were chirps of the crickets and hoots of the owls, nothing more than that. Even though Faith was scared, at least she&rsquo;s with her friends. What she said to Marianna earlier is truly how she felt - traveling from village to village and having adventures is better than staying in that prison of a palace.</p></p>

<p><p>After walking a while, they finally found a long flight of stairs as at the base of the mountain, which will lead to the temple at the top.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We are here.&rdquo; Darian announced.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hey Faith, have you ever been in a temple before?&rdquo; Marianna asked.<br>  &ldquo;Once, I think, when I was little.&rdquo; Faith replied. &ldquo;But I was accompanied by several guards. I don&rsquo;t remember much.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna explained: &ldquo;Monks are supposed to be decent, honest people. Much different than commoners.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;They are also very spiritually aware.&rdquo; Darian added. &ldquo;They do not have earthly desires like other people, and thus they can access the spirit world very easily.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I want to see them with my own eyes.&rdquo; said Faith.</p></p>

<p><p>So without further ado, the three traversed up the long flight of stairs - and long means long - at the bottom, they cannot even see the temple. The temple was barely visible halfway up.</p></p>

<p><p>By the time they got to the top of the stairs, they can finally see the temple in full view. It is just what Faith expected it to be - an old, dusty building with a triangular roof. In the courtyard, there was a monk sweeping the floor.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh my, we have visitors.&rdquo; said <strong>Carmine</strong>.</p></p>

<p><p>Darian walked over to him and lowered his head a little. &ldquo;Nice to meet you sir.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The pleasure is mine.&rdquo; replied the monk, bowing. &ldquo;It is rare for us to have guests.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My name is Faith. And this is Marianna. And this man is Darian.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The monk smiled and bowed again. &ldquo;Nice to meet you. My name is Carmine. Please, come inside.&rdquo; So the monk led them to the main temple building.</p></p>

<p><p>It was lit up by candles, so the lighting was dim and the features were barely visible.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith, Marianna and Darian kneeled in front of the head monk. Two other monks stood by the doorway to stand guard.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Welcome to our temple, guests. You may call me <strong>Fuchsia</strong>. I am the one in charge here.&rdquo; Fuchsia is considerably older than the others, perhaps 60 to 70 years of age, with distinguishing features as white eyebrows and a long white beard.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It is an honor to meet you sir.&rdquo; said Darian. I will cut to the chase. My friends and I are here because there have been rumors about a demon infestation here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Demons, in this temple?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That is correct.&rdquo; Darian responded.</p></p>

<p><p>Fuchsia laughed heartily. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s ridiculous. There are no demons here. If there were, my students and I would have sensed them a long time ago.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Then what of the rumors?&rdquo; Faith inquired.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Naturally, they are false.&rdquo; Fuchsia replied, touching his beard.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Then...are we at the right place?&rdquo; Marianna asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably the townsfolk making stuff up because they get paranoid.&rdquo; said Darian.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna did a face palm to herself. &ldquo;So we came here for nothing?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was about to get up. &ldquo;I guess there is no reason for us to be here. We better get going now.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Fuchsia extended his arm. &ldquo;There is no need to hurry, young ones. You can stay the night here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to impose...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Fuchsia: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no trouble at all, I assure you. It is already late, just stay for the night. Our temple is big and empty, we could use the company.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna: &ldquo;Since you insist, we will stay here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith: &ldquo;Marianna...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. When someone is generous, you pay them back by accepting their generosity.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>It is rare for Marianna to say something so wise and sensible, so Faith agreed. &ldquo;Alright. Thank you, Fuchsia.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Fuchsia: &ldquo;Carmine, would you please show our guests to their rooms?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna and Faith walked into one of the rooms. It was old and dusty, as expected of an old temple, but it was free, so they did not mind. &ldquo;What kind monks they are.&rdquo; Faith commented.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna: &ldquo;I know. They are just like Old Lady Tanae from the village. It&rsquo;s good to know there&rsquo;s people who have a good heart in this world. &rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So this will be my room. What about yours?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mine is down the hall. Are you going to sleep right away?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take a bath first...&rdquo; Faith then smelled her shirt sleeve. &ldquo;All this traveling is making me smell.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;See ya, princess.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>As the night became quieter and calmer, the heroes finally have a chance to relax, to rest their bodies and their minds. A lot has happened in the village, including the fight against Rubeus, and their journey to the Buddhist temple. They were tired from all the fighting and traveling.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith went to the bathroom to check out the tub. To her delight, it was spacious, as the tub was meant for public bathing. But tonight, she can have this space all to herself. This reminds her of the luxuries of the palace. Back home, Faith had everything she wanted, food, clothing, and a spacious bath. But there was one thing she yearned for - freedom. And for that freedom, she gave up all those things.</p></p>

<p><p>Darian was unable to sleep. He lay down on his bed and stared at the full moon. The moon was bright and round, just like the night when he lost his kingdom. No matter where he goes, he is haunted by the vision of his kingdom burning to the ground, with him helpless to do anything about it. It is all because of that tyrant named Vega. Darian, as the leader of the fallen kingdom, will never forgive him. He will travel the entire continent if he must to find this Vega and kill him.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, a man wearing a cape and mask flew by the window. Although he appeared for a brief second, he looked strikingly similar to Vega. Darian jumped out of bed, grabbed his sword, and jumped out the window.</p></p>

<p><p>The Vega look-alike jumped from rooftop to rooftop, and Darian chased using his top speed. His heart was pounding, his palms were sweaty. Tonight he will finally get revenge for his fallen kingdom.</p></p>

<p><p>Unable to sleep, Marianna went outside to the temple grounds to practice her archery. Suddenly, something in the trees moved, and she fired her arrow at it. A man jumped down and landed. The man had blue hair and he wore black attire and carries an arrow patch on his back. There is no doubt he&rsquo;s Arkady. Marianna chased him as he ran into the forest.</p></p>

<p><p>Darian continued to chase the Vega look-alike. &ldquo;Hey you, stop!&rdquo; he yelled.</p></p>

<p><p>The look-alike turned to face him as he was running. Suddenly, they both stopped running and stared at each other. Darian drew his sword and slashed him.</p></p>

<p><p>The masked man jumped away, however, his mask was hit and it split into two, revealing his face. Darian gasped in shock. It was the face of Ren.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You?! You&rsquo;re not Vega!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh, it looks like I&rsquo;ve been busted.&rdquo; said Ren with a smirk on his face.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo; Darian scolded.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus appeared behind Darian and blasted him in the back. *Bam* Darian got up. &ldquo;It was a trap...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus: &ldquo;So you are indeed him...the Prince of Zaibach. But Zaibach doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore...so you&rsquo;re just a fallen prince.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darian: &ldquo;You...how do you know about this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard about Zaibach&rsquo;s destruction at the hands of the one named Vega. Although I have never met Vega, many people have seem him, and they know what he looks like. I&rsquo;ve heard rumors that Zaibach had a talented prince who could play the flute, a gifted genius born with a sense of music no mortal can attain. And the other night, you used your flute as a weapon, so then realized that you must him, the fallen prince.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darian: &ldquo;So you used the image of Vega to lure me into your trap? That&rsquo;s a dirty trick you played!&rdquo;<br>  Rubeus smiled.</p></p>

<p><p>Darian: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll pay for provoking me. Did you forget that my flute is your weakness?&rdquo; He takes out his flute and starts playing.</p></p>

<p><p>Ren covers his ears, falling on his knees in pain. Rubeus started doing a chant, and thus, remains unaffected by the music.</p></p>

<p><p>Darian: &ldquo;Impossible. How can the music not have any affect on you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus: &ldquo;Fool, did you think I came unprepared? The chant I did allows me to block one of my senses, and I block my hearing.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You disabled your hearing. What an unbelievable guy!&rdquo; Darian grew nervous, and took a step back.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now, play time is over.&rdquo; Rubeus opened his palm and fired a beam. Darian blocked it, but it pushed him further back. He fell off the cliff and screamed as he entered the darkness of the abyss.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna chased Arkady throughout the forest. She loaded an arrow into her bow and fired it, Arkady ducked and avoided a fatal blow to the head. Marianna loaded another one and Arkady leapt into the trees, away from sight.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna fired at the trees and she missed. Arkady fired an arrow at her, and she jumped away from it. A series of arrows came at her, and she rolled away. *twang twang*</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady jumped down and they faced each other. They just exited the forest and were now standing at the edge of a tall mountain. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s settle this, shall we?&rdquo; he said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; Marianna replied. She loaded up an arrow into her bow and put all of her spirit energy into it, and it was glowing a bright blue color.</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady did the same, and his arrow glowed red. &ldquo;Demonic Arrow!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Celestial Arrow!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They fired at the same time and the arrows hit each other. The Demonic Arrow broke through the Celestial Arrow, and Marianna had no time to dodge. It hit her right leg. &ldquo;Aaaaaah!&rdquo; she screamed.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna fell down on her knees, in disbelief that she lost in archery to someone else.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s over. With that leg you can&rsquo;t run anywhere.&rdquo; he said, loading an arrow.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna limped over to the edge of the cliff. &ldquo;This was a trap, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she asked with anger in her eyes. &ldquo;You were waiting for us at the temple.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;And you fell for it.&rdquo; Arkady replied &ldquo;You have two choices now. One, let my arrow pierce your chest, or jump off the cliff on your own.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna grunted in anger.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Either way you&rsquo;re not escaping alive. Personally, I&rsquo;d choose the arrow...at least if you die this way, there&rsquo;s still a body left.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>As she stepped on the very edge of the cliff, a few pebbles fell into the valley. It was so deep that it seemed bottomless. If Marianna was to fall off the cliff, it could be the end of her life. What a predicament for her to be in - and she wonders if this is the end of the line for her.</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady, pointing the arrow sternly at her, awaited her answer. Marianna then made her decision, and she smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not giving you the satisfaction.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady was displeased by her answer. &ldquo;Fine, so be it!&rdquo; He let go of the arrow, and it flew at her. *Whoosh*</p></p>

<p><p>Just as the arrow was about to hit her face, Marianna took a step off the edge, and fell backwards. *Whoosh* The arrow missed her and flew past her, while she fell into the bottomless pit.</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady was in disbelief. He ran towards the edge and stared at the darkness below. There was nothing but blackness down there, so there is no point in searching for a body. He assumed that his mission is complete, and walked towards the forest.</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="f">[ F ] - Fallen Monks </span></p></center>

<p><p>Faith stepped into the bath and let her body become soaked in the hot water. It felt good against her skin and she immediately became relaxed. After a long day of traveling and physical labor, she can finally take a break and let her body rest. The water was warm and just the right temperature. She sighed in pleasure and she can finally forget about all her worries.</p></p>

<p><p>The size of the bath was huge; it was meant for public bathing. Since many monks live in the temple, they would often share the bathroom and bathe at the same time. There were two bathrooms, one for men and one for women, but since no women lived in the temple, the female bathroom remained unused. But that changed upon Faith and Marianna's arrival.</p></p>

<p><p>Since Faith is by herself, the tub felt very spacious. She could even swim around if she wanted to. She washed her shoulders and her arms, and splashed water on her face.</p></p>

<p><p>But little did she know, she was not by herself. A peeping tom was watching in the shadows. He quietly crept into the room and went into the water hardly making a sound.</p></p>

<p><p>As she washed her face, Faith felt the presence of another person in the room. She turned around, covering her breasts. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; There was nothing but silence in the room. A minute has passed and there was no noise or any signs of an intruder. So Faith dismissed it, thinking she&rsquo;s just paranoid.</p></p>

<p><p>She sighed and went back to bathing. But then there were bubbles in the water. Faith turned around and gasped. What could it be?</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, a man&rsquo;s head appeared and then his face was revealed to be Cerise.</p></p>

<p><p>This caught her by complete surprise. She was naked and her guard was down, but all of a sudden, there is another man in the same water as her. Faith instinctively screamed and crossed her arms over her breasts.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hey baby&#8230;maybe we can wash each other&rsquo;s backs?&rdquo; said Cerise with an evil grin on his face. He made a grabbing gesture towards.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith shrieked and splashed water on his face, causing him to be blind for a few seconds. She quickly swam to the edge of the tub, got out of the water and snatched the pink towel and quickly wrapped it around herself.</p></p>

<p><p>The temple was dark at night, and barely lit by candles, so it was hard to navigate the place. She made it the prayer room, still dripping wet, and her hand clinging onto the pink towel she&rsquo;s wearing.</p></p>

<p><p>She saw Maroon and Magenta come into the room and instinctively screamed. &ldquo;Aaaaah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The monks were startled by seeing her and her screaming. Their jaws nearly dropped as they witnessed a woman clad in a towel and nothing else. Magenta&rsquo;s eyes scanned her from her toes all up to her face and he swallowed hard. His companion Maroon had the same reaction. In this remote temple, they don&rsquo;t get visitors often, especially female ones. This was medieval times so women dressed up conservatively, showing little skin and leaving little to the imagination. And they couldn&rsquo;t possibly remember the last time they saw a female in her natural form. Even though they&rsquo;re supposed to be celibate monks, they strayed from the path of celibacy. They&rsquo;re no longer orthodox monks, but fallen monks who have betrayed their kind.</p></p>

<p><p>They noticed the curves on her legs and how smooth her skin was. The towel barely covered the top of her thighs. Her arms squeezed the towel tightly against her torso. The skin on her arms were the same color as her legs and equally flawless. And last but not least was her face. They already knew she was attractive, but seeing her face with this naked body was a sight to behold. Her expression of fear and worry made her look more attractive to them.</p></p>

<p><p>And on top of that, water was <strong>dripping</strong> from various parts of her body...she was fresh out of the bath. Water was dripping from her thighs as well as her forearms. There&rsquo;s a few drops on her cleavage and neck. This was a rare sight indeed for these lonely men who live in isolation...perhaps a once in a lifetime opportunity.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?!&rdquo; she said.</p></p>

<p><p>Magenta snapped out of his daze. &ldquo;Ms. Faith we heard you screaming so we came right away.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; asked Maroon.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Somebody was in the bath&#8230;&rdquo; she blurted out, still catching her breath.</p></p>

<p><p>Maroon&rsquo;s eyes widened. &ldquo;You mean...you were bathing <strong>with</strong> someone else?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No! That&rsquo;s not what I meant!&rdquo; Faith yelled angrily.</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise, the one who was peeping on her, snuck into the room unnoticed. He hid behind one of them columns.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He was peeping on me!&rdquo; She could tell that the monks were leering at her body and became embarrassed. &ldquo;What are you two doing here anyway?!&rdquo; she yelled while flustered.</p></p>

<p><p>She has been living a sheltered life all this time and she no experience being in such a vulnerable situation before. She was not prepared to deal with someone spying on her in the bath and trying to harass her while she&rsquo;s naked and her guard was down.</p></p>

<p><p>These monks leering at her body made her feel uncomfortable. Even though she&rsquo;s wearing a towel it didn&rsquo;t cover much and she felt exposed.</p></p>

<p><p>Maroon opened his palms to portray his innocence. &ldquo;We heard you screaming so we came here to check up on you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;Faith_towel_drops&quot;></a></p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The one who was peeping on me is one of your monks!&rdquo; she yelled, still flustered. She even gestured by clenching her fists in front of her. &ldquo;This is the woman&rsquo;s bathroom! You can&rsquo;t just walk in and out as you please!&rdquo; Without her hands to hold onto the towel, the knot in front of her breasts slipped and the towel dropped on the floor. <strong>*Plop*</strong></p></p>

<p><p>All the monks saw her naked form and stood there like a deer in headlights. Magenta&rsquo;s eyes dilated and he did not even blink once and his jaw dropped. Cerise stared without blinking as he has a nice view of her natural form from behind.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith shrieked from the embarrassment and immediately covered her breasts with one arm and picked up the towel with the other hand. She stood back up and clasped the towel against her front.</p></p>

<p><p>Maroon folded his hands. &ldquo;Oh, praise the Buddha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about that. I didn&rsquo;t meant to look.&rdquo; said Magenta, waving his hands in front of him.</p></p>

<p><p> Even though he apologized, the look in his eyes betrayed him. No matter if they&rsquo;re monks, they&rsquo;re still men who have lust and desires, and it was obvious they enjoyed seeing her naked.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith wrapped the towel around herself and made sure the knot was tight. &ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; she yelled. &ldquo;Just get out&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A woman is raised to be prudish and conservative and not reveal her natural form to any man...but she is not just a woman but a princess. Her upbringing was even more strict than the average person. A woman&rsquo;s body is her most valuable asset and to be seen like this was taboo.</p></p>

<p><p>This was the first time in her life that a man has seen her naked and she didn&rsquo;t know how to handle it. She was angry and afraid at the same time. A normal woman would feel nervous and humiliated, amongst other strong feelings. But Faith felt those feelings a hundred fold. She revealed herself to not just one man, but <strong>two</strong> men at the same time.</p></p>

<p><p>The monks ignored her orders and tried to calm her down. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t see it anything. Honest. Right Magenta?&rdquo; said Maroon.</p></p>

<p><p>Magenta quickly jumped on the bandwagon. &ldquo;Yeah. It was so quick I hardly see anything.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Just leave!&rdquo; Faith snapped, pointing at the door.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Cerise snuck up on her from behind and grabbed her breasts. &ldquo;Heh heh heh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith gasped as she was caught by surprise. Even Maroon and Magenta were not expecting him to do this.</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise fondled her breasts, pushing them up and down, while his face was smelling her hair. &ldquo;Oooh they feel so good. So soft and firm.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The only thing between his filthy hands and her bare skin is the thin piece of fabric called a towel. He could feel the shape of her breasts as well as their firmness. Faith moaned in extreme discomfort. &ldquo;Uhhh! Uhhh! Uhhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He took a big inhale while smelling her hair. She smelled good being fresh out of the bath. This is the best time to smell a woman up close.</p></p>

<p><p>Magenta and Maroon were flabbergasted by their colleague&rsquo;s actions. They admired him for being brave enough to molest her and at the same time they were jealous he gets to touch her like that. They just stared silently without blinking, enjoying the show.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Uhhh! Uhhh! Stop...stop it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise put his lips on her shoulder and kissed it. He made successive kisses towards her neck and her cheek. Her skin tasted good and smelled good. Not only that but her skin was still wet and that made it taste even better. And he was enjoying this sensation while groping her breasts.</p></p>

<p><p>The poor girl was overwhelmed as she was violated in so many places at once. &ldquo;Uhhh! Uhhh!&rdquo; To be violated by a man in such a way was not something she was prepared for. Her fingers clenched tightly to form a fist. Even one more second of this was too much for her to handle. Her elbows flared out to the side to loosen Cerise&rsquo;s arm, then she stepped forward to make a gap between. She elbowed him in the stomach and he stuttered backwards.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh so you want to play rough eh?&rdquo; He made a grabbing gesture towards her.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith had no time to think...she threw a roundhouse kick to his face. *Thud* Cerise was not prepared for a blow like that and he fell down.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How dare you!&rdquo; she shrieked. Right now she was very upset. Her eyebrows slanted towards the center and the look in her eyes changed to one of anger.</p></p>

<p><p>The fallen monk showed his palm trying to make peace. &ldquo;No wait. Don&rsquo;t be rash. That was a joke! It was a joke!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She raised her leg up high, getting ready to stomp him.</p></p>

<p><p>From this angle, Cerise can see the area under the towel. &ldquo;I can see&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith, seeing where his eyes were leering at, realized what he meant, and quickly dropped her leg. She squeezed the towel between her thighs in embarrassment. Her face was blushing red.</p></p>

<p><p>She has never fought in a towel before and didn&rsquo;t even consider that raising her leg that high would reveal herself. This situation is beyond ludicrous and she can&rsquo;t think straight, all she can do is react.</p></p>

<p><p>With her distracted, Magenta grabbed her breasts from behind, which sent shivers all over her body. &ldquo;Since we&rsquo;re here why don&rsquo;t we have some fun?&rdquo; He squeezed her breasts in the same way that Cerise did. He was jealous that his colleague got some action but happy that it&rsquo;s his turn.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith shoved his arms away and backed up a few steps. Her hands instinctively covered her breasts after being violated in that spot. Magenta has finally revealed his true colors. He was never on her side to begin with. And that means Maroon is the same. These two just wanted to see naked and grope her body and waited for their chance.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Stop...you...you&rsquo;re perverts!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Magenta and Maroon approached her, their hands making grabbing gestures, with a lustful look on their faces.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll save you from Cerise. Come and give daddy a kiss!&rdquo; said Maroon.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith shrieked as he approached. She threw a <strong>high kick</strong> to his cheek but he caught her calf in his hand. He took some damage from the kick, but it was worth it. Balancing on one leg, she was not able to do much. Maroon turned his face sideways and kissed her ankle and shin. Her skin felt so soft and smooth against his cheek and tasted good. Faith was disgusted by his touch and struggled desperately to get her leg free. Maroon let go of her leg and she almost fell backwards.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Just what kind of monks are you?&rdquo; Faith scolded as she took a step back.</p></p>

<p><p>Magenta approached her little by little. &ldquo;Do you know how long it&rsquo;s been since we&rsquo;ve had a woman in the temple? We&rsquo;re just a bunch of lonely men.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Maroon continued: &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t seen the skin of a woman in a long time. Why don&rsquo;t you help us out?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Magenta: &ldquo;Just think of it as doing charity.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>By now, Cerise was standing up, placing his hands on his head, the part that hit the concrete during the fall.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith stepped back some more until her back hit the wall. Their leering eyes and perverted grabbing gestures made her afraid. This is a bad situation for Faith, as she is all alone, stuck in a room full of horny monks who want to strip her naked...and by the looks on their faces, they want to do a lot more than stripping.</p></p>

<p><p>Even though she&rsquo;s scared, her fighting spirit hasn&rsquo;t waned one bit. She&rsquo;s a lover but also a fighter at heart. Ever since she was a child she has trained in martial arts under strict discipline so fighting is all she knows. This is how she always gets out of danger.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m warning you&#8230;stay back.&rdquo; Faith got into fighting stance.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oooh, you want to fight? We&rsquo;ve got a tough one here.&rdquo; said Maroon in a sarcastic tone.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t underestimate me!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p></p>

<p><p>The monks did not take her seriously, they only insulted her even further.</p></p>

<p><p>Magenta: &ldquo;What can you possibly do in a towel? Heh heh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Maroon: &ldquo;Oh look she&rsquo;s angry. Ha ha ha ha.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith dashed forward, aiming for Maroon and drew her arm back, getting ready to throw a hard punch. Seeing how she was coming at him, Maroon was worried for a second. Her kicks from earlier were the real deal and she might actually pose a threat.</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;Faith_towel_drops_2&quot;></a></p></p>

<p><p>While being angry and embarrassed, Faith forget to tighten the knot on her towel. It became loose after so many movements she made. While dashing, the knot came off and her towel slipped off her body. For a quick second, she was naked while her arm was drawn back.</p></p>

<p><p>This was Maroon&rsquo;s lucky day. This view was better than last time because he can see everything from up close.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aaaah!&rdquo; Faith shrieked and quickly picked up the towel.</p></p>

<p><p>She backed away to the wall. There was a small figure of Buddha on the top of the wall, and when she bumped against the wall, it shook slightly. It was already half on the edge, about to fall at any moment.</p></p>

<p><p>Maroon: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? What happened to all that tough talk?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith tied the knot against her chest. She did not want it to fall again. The three monks were lined up and with the wall behind her, she was basically trapped like a rat in a cage.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;D-Don&rsquo;t come closer!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to fight wearing only that.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Magenta: &ldquo;I like women who have spunk. She&rsquo;s a real tough cookie, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Maroon: &ldquo;Oh. I can&rsquo;t wait to feel her soft skin against my face.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The monks continued to leer at her body and make their remarks.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;D-Don&rsquo;t come closer!&rdquo; Faith was trapped against the wall and she feared for her life. There were three of them, and one of her...and the fact that she&rsquo;s wearing a towel puts her in a compromising situation. One hand was over her breasts while the other hand squeezed the towel between her legs. Her eyes were shaking and she panted for breath.</p></p>

<p><p>The perverted monks liked the expression on her face. She appeared meek and nervous...and they like submissive women.</p></p>

<p><p>Magenta was fantasizing about what to do with her. He can&rsquo;t wait to make her a sex slave...someone who will do his bidding and never talk back. She will be forced to do all the house chores that he has to do - like scrubbing the floor. And she will be scrubbing while wearing a towel - she&rsquo;s not allowed to wear clothes when he&rsquo;s in charge. And after she&rsquo;s done her chores, he can have his way with her on the floor.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hehehehe. Someone like her will make a perfect slave.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise: &ldquo;Come here baby...let&rsquo;s take a bath together. Or maybe a sponge bath.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Maroon: &ldquo;Ohhh those breasts...those legs. She makes the perfect wife.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Magenta: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry my dear...we&rsquo;ll be gentle...at first! Hehehe.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Her left arm dropped to her side and her palm touched the wall.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was scared for her life and rightfully so...but if she doesn&rsquo;t do anything...the worst will happen. The fact that these dirty lechers saw her naked made her angry. And to top it off, they violated various parts of her body, something that should never happen to a maiden like her.</p></p>

<p><p>Her palm became a fist...and her eyebrows lowered and she made a grimace. She was not going to let them get away with their sins.</p></p>

<p><p>These monks are supposed to practice celibacy, and uphold virtues of honor and trust. Yet look at how low they&rsquo;ve fallen&#8230;</p></p>

<p><p>Her right arm dropped to the side and made a fist.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith is a princess with a pure soul and pure body. Not only did these monks lie and betray her, but they even tried to defile her purity with their dirty hands.</p></p>

<p><p>The lechers inched their way towards her, but stopped when they felt her ki. They thought she was an ordinary woman, so they were shocked, to say the least, that Faith could release such a large amount of ki. As she grew angrier, pink energy was released from her body.</p></p>

<p><p>The pink energy appeared as waves and caused her body to glow. The monks winced from the energy. Now they know she means business.</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise: &ldquo;How can this woman have this kind of power? Who is she?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Magenta: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know! Ren never mentioned this!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Her ki kept the monks from approaching her any further. They remained frozen in place. Faith continued to power up, clenching her fists and putting strain on her body. Her ponytail was waving around due to the energy being released, and she even changed the wind currents in the room.</p></p>

<p><p>The Buddha figurine on the wall was rocking back and forth on the edge, ready to fall at any moment.</p></p>

<p><p>The monks winced from the excess wind. The pink energy continued to emerge from her body. Faith herself did not realize what kind of hidden power she had inside of her. This feeling is the same feeling she had last time...that time when she was surrounded by demons. Her life was this close to death, and in that moment, something snapped inside of her, and she released her hidden power. Or at least she began to.</p></p>

<p><p>Unfortunately, that time, she was not able to harness her power. Since then, she was unable to summon this power...until now.</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;Faith_towel_drops_3&quot;></a></p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, the Buddha figurine fell off the wall and hit her on the top of the head. *Thump*</p></p>

<p><p>Faith grabbed the top of her head and groaned from the pain. &ldquo;Ugggghhh!&rdquo; In an instant the energy vanished as she suffered from the wound. With nothing holding onto the towel, it slipped off her chest and dropped on the floor. The monks got an eyeful again. Their jaws nearly dropped...and they stared with wide-open eyes without blinking even once.</p></p>

<p><p>She felt the towel slip off her body...and when she opened her eyes, she saw the monks staring at her dumbfounded. She looked down in false hope that it didn&rsquo;t happen...but it did. She was completely exposed in front of these deviants and she screamed out loud and covered her private parts with both hands. Faith fell on her knees and snatched the towel to cover herself.</p></p>

<p><p>Now that she is no longer a threat, Maroon approached her with a wicked smile on his lips. He snatched the towel away from her and she gasped. Maroon threw the towel to Magenta. He put the towel in his face and smelled it, sighing in pleasure. He threw the towel to Cerise who did the same, he stuffed it on his face and smelled it.</p></p>

<p><p>Without her towel, Faith had nothing to cover herself with except her hands. One hand was on her breasts and the other hand was between her legs. The three monks were leering at her with lustful eyes and perverted grins on their faces. Their eyes were lustful the moment they saw her in a towel. But now that she&rsquo;s naked, their eyes became completely full of lust and evil.</p></p>

<p><p>This is the worst possible situation for Faith&#8230;She was naked, and on her knees, and trapped against the wall. At this point escape is no longer possible...even defending herself was not possible she was a lamb about to be slaughtered.</p></p>

<p><p>They continue making remarks. &ldquo;So, she&rsquo;s just a regular woman after all.&rdquo; said Maroon.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...no...please!&rdquo; Faith cried out.</p></p>

<p><p>But her cries were in vain. It was clear what they wanted from the beginning...to strip her of everything and do unspeakably horrible things to her body. And now they were about to get what they want. The monks stared at her naked body like a wolf stare at its prey.</p></p>

<p><p>Magenta smiled wickedly. &ldquo;She sure gave us a scare back there.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s kinda cute when she screams like that.&rdquo; said Maroon.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s entire body trembled from fear and suspense. To be completely naked in front of these horny men is a situation that&rsquo;s beyond her <strong>nightmares</strong>...this is a scenario straight from <strong>hell</strong>. She feared for her life...what is going to happen next? But instinctively, she knows what is going to happen. Tears dripped from her shaking eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ohhh yes...I like that look.&rdquo; said Cerise. &ldquo;Submissive women are my type.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Especially if they&rsquo;re naked! Hahahaha.&rdquo; said Magenta.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now, why don&rsquo;t we have some fun with her&#8230;&rdquo; said Maroon.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...no...please!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>In her point of view the monks seem like giants...they kept growing while she kept shrinking. They approached her and their hands reached for her...while their laughter echoed in the background.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please no!!!&rdquo; More tears dripped down her cheek.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha!&rdquo; One of their hands came closer and closer to her face.</p></p>

<p><p>In her eyeball, one could see the reflection of Maroon&rsquo;s hand coming closer and closer...</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No! No! AAAAHHHHHH!&rdquo; Faith&rsquo;s screams echoed throughout the temple.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna was limping around in the darkness. It was a bad idea to move in her condition, but she somehow sensed Darian nearby. She did not know how or why, but she just knows it to be true...probably a woman&rsquo;s intuition or something greater. And it turns out she is right. Darian was heading in her direction. He was in worse shape than Marianna.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You look pretty bad.&rdquo; Darian said half jokingly.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Look who&rsquo;s talking.&rdquo; Mari replied also jokingly.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How did Rubeus&rsquo;s men find us? Was it the monks who leaked the information?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Most likely. They&rsquo;re not as innocent as we thought. We need to go back to the temple.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure you can go with your leg like that?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I can manage. We have a princess to save.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>However, before they can do any kind of fighting, they have to treat their wounds. They traveled a short distance before finding an abandoned house, the place they will stay and re-strategize.</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;TheAftermath_1&quot;></a>The Aftermath 1</p></p>

<p><p>In the dark and damp room, Faith lay on the ground butt naked. She was face flat, staring sideways at the wall, her arms were spread out diagonally, palms facing up.</p></p>

<p><p>The monks were done with her already and she has been lying in the same spot, not having moved an inch. She was in complete shock over what happened...Her eyes were wet, and a teardrop fell down her face. Her throat was dry from screaming, and her lips were pale, and her face was dirty.</p></p>

<p><p>She did not know or care how much time has passed since she has been in this dark room. The only thing on her mind was what horrors they did to her.</p></p>

<p><p>The three monks have her surrounded, she was against the wall, and that means escape is impossible. She was naked and helpless, kneeling on the ground, her arms covering her private parts. Their devilish laughter echoed through the room, their leering eyes were glowing red, piercing the darkness. These monks were not men, they were more like beasts...or rather, demons.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now, why don&rsquo;t we have some fun&#8230;&rdquo; Maroon&rsquo;s hand reached for her.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s eyes were shaking in fear and tears dripped from her eyes. &ldquo;No&#8230;please!&rdquo; She was directly in front of the wall, so she was completely trapped.</p></p>

<p><p>Maroon bent down to her level and his hand grabbed her hair. Tears drip down her face as she stared at him frightfully. &ldquo;Stop...please....&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Maroon forced his lips into hers, and the tears streamed down her face like a river. For this man to kiss her like this, it has to be the single worst moment of her life...yet it&rsquo;s only the beginning of the end.</p></p>

<p><p>Even though her eyes were tired from crying, just thinking about that moment caused her eyes to swell up with tears, and they slowly dripped down her cheek like a water faucet.</p></p>

<p><p>Her throat was dried up from screaming...when they violated her she screamed louder and longer than she ever had in her life. She could not make any noises even if she wanted to.</p></p>

<p><p>Poor Faith had to go through what no woman should ever go through...the humiliation and suffering was not something that can be described in words...it's not even something that can be imagined.</p></p>

<p><p>Her body felt the full aftermath of the torture session...she was exhausted beyond comparison...but that's only the beginning. She was thirsty from all the screaming...and hungry as well. Her lips were pale and dry...her hair was messed up and her face was dirty and bruised. There were lashes and bruises all over her body...going from her cheeks all the way down to her lower thighs. Whatever happened earlier, the monks have spared her no mercy.</p></p>

<p><p>Her entire body was aching and tired and that&rsquo;s only the physical pain. The psychological pain was one hundred times worse...maybe a thousand times worse.</p></p>

<p><p>Growing up as a princess, Faith was spoiled by everyone, especially her father. She always got what she wanted, whether it be the latest toy, or the best food, or the fanciest clothes. She had servants who did everything for her - from dressing her up on the morning to taking baths at night - everything was at her beck and call.</p></p>

<p><p>Ever since Faith ran away from home, she has faced many hardships. But she never, ever thought she&rsquo;d have to go through something like this...not in a million years. But it&rsquo;s too late for regrets, it has already happened. Her body has been defiled, and it will never go back to the way it was before...never.</p></p>

<p><p>At this time, she really regrets leaving the palace. She left a note for her father and never told him directly. Looking back, that was a foolish move. If she had not left the palace, none of this would have happened...</p></p>

<p><p>How did things turn out this way? One moment she was a princess, surrounded by luxury, and the next moment, she was having an adventure with her friends. And now, she was lying here in this dark room in this pathetic state.</p></p>

<p><p>She laid there motionlessly, wallowing in her own shame and helplessness...her body exposed and defiled.</p></p>

<p><p>The only audible sound was the occasional dripping from the ceiling. Drip, drip, drip. The sound echoed loudly throughout the small silent room.</p></p>

<p><p>She felt the cold concrete pressed against her naked body. It was uncomfortable to be in this position, her body felt a little bit chilly since all of her skin was exposed to the air. The concrete also felt cold against her sensitive skin.</p></p>

<p><p>In all her life, she only gets naked to take baths. She had the option of having servants bathe her, but she always refused, preferring to do it herself. Faith has never been naked in front of another person...she has been raised to be a prude and must never show her skin, especially to a man. She hasn&rsquo;t even been naked in front of Marianna, whose another girl and also her best friend.</p></p>

<p><p>But all her efforts to preserve herself were in vain. Her body has been exposed to another man...no, even worse, three men at once. Not only did they see her naked, but they completely had their way with her.</p></p>

<p><p>Maroon was pulling her hair and yanking her head up and down. She was moaning and groaning like a helpless animal. Then he violently shoved her head to the side, making her fall down sideways. *Splat*</p></p>

<p><p>Faith turned herself over so that she&rsquo;s facing them...one hand instinctively covered her breasts while the other covered her vital spot. While like this, she was unable to move.</p></p>

<p><p>The three monks walked over to her and leered at her exposed body with lust and perversion in their eyes. They laughed and sneered at her. Hahahahaha!</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...please!&rdquo; Faith&rsquo;s body was trembling and her eyes were shaking.</p></p>

<p><p>All of their hands reached for her.</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;No...please!! Noooooooo!!!&rdquo; She has never been this afraid in her life. She was butt naked and these monks kept laughing.</p></p>

<p><p>Their demonic faces faded and blended into the darkness, leaving behind only their deep red eyes and their hands.</p></p>

<p><p>All she could do was scream in terror...as their hands were about to reach her. &ldquo;AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A tear drop appeared in the corner of her eye and slowly dripped down her cheek. These monks have done the unthinkable to her and they not only ruined her body, but her entire life. A princess must keep her chastity no matter what. But for Faith, it&rsquo;s too late. She&rsquo;s no longer a princess, but rather a woman who is damaged goods. All her efforts were rendered useless for her entire life has been destroyed in a single night.</p></p>

<p><p>So this is it, huh? This is how things are going to end? The thought of escaping never occurred to her, because she&rsquo;s still grief stricken in her sad, lifeless state. Even if she&rsquo;s to escape, she cannot change what happened to her. For the first time in her life, Faith contemplated suicide - maybe if she was gone, then she won&rsquo;t have to feel this pain anymore.</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;AM_Cerise_comes_in&quot;></a></p></p>

<p><p><strong>Creeeeek</strong>. The door slowly opened, and Cerise came in. He closed the door carefully. Faith heard the door creek and the sound of footsteps, but she was too focused on her own pain to show any reaction.</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise bent down and placed his hand on her hamstring and felt her up. &ldquo;How are you, my dear?&rdquo; Faith showed some reaction to his touch. He slowly glided his hand from her hamstring and up to her butt. The texture of Faith&rsquo;s skin felt good against his palm, it was soft and smooth. He squeezed her butt cheek and he liked it the way it feels, it was soft yet firm.</p></p>

<p><p>His hand felt up her back and went up to her shoulder. He placed his hand on her face and brushed her ponytail out of the way. And he brushed his finger along her face. &ldquo;Shall we continue where we left off?&rdquo; he whispered into her ear.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith felt everything being done to her and heard every word he said, but showed no reaction. Her eyes did not even blink. She had no energy left to even move or say anything. Or rather, she did not even try, she has lost all hope and given up completely. She just laid there like a lifeless doll, a lamb for the slaughter.</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise kneeled on top of her bottom half and he started snickering. He&rsquo;s going to enjoy screwing this woman...it&rsquo;s like you just had a good meal and you come back for seconds. What&rsquo;s even better is that she&rsquo;s not resisting at all. The last time he screwed her, she resisted a lot and he had to restrain her. It was fun screwing a woman that had so much energy. But it will be even more fun when she doesn&rsquo;t resist at all.</p></p>

<p><p>The monk lay down on top of her completely, putting his face in her hair. He sniffed it and sighed in pleasure.</p></p>

<p><p>It was uncomfortable for Faith to have this monk lay on top of her. His body felt heavy and his touch was disgusting. She was completely naked and this monk was rubbing his body against hers. She was battered and bruised yet he continued to violate her, disregarding her well being and feelings. Poor girl, after all that suffering, she still has to go through this torture. This is probably the hell that comes after the hell.</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise kissed her face with his dirty lips. Faith showed a slight reaction to it, but she did not make a noise. She just stared at the wall blankly, ignoring the physical pain as if it&rsquo;s not real. She has already resigned herself to her fate.</p></p>

<p><p>He kissed her shoulders, feeling them fully with his lips. He glided his face along her back, tasting her and smelling her skin at the same time. He kissed her back and sighed in pleasure.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s mouth opened slightly to moan, but no sounds came out. When the three monks violated her, she screamed louder than she has ever screamed in her whole life.</p></p>

<p><p>But now her voice was gone.</p></p>

<p><p>Every second that passed by felt like an hour, and every hour felt like an eternity. She thought she could pretend that this is not happening...but it&rsquo;s impossible. Her fingers twitched a little bit...and that&rsquo;s all the movements she could do...hoping that eventually he will stop doing this to her. She continued to stare blankly at the wall while she silently cursed her fate.</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise became more turned on as he touched her more. His hands were rubbing her upper arms while his face was buried into her back. Faith breathed harder as his assault continued. He moved his face to her shoulder and kissed it all over, then put his face into her hair to smell it.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You smell good. I&rsquo;ll make you my woman.&rdquo; he whispered. He proceeded to kiss her on the cheek.</p></p>

<p><p>Those words pierced her soul as a sharp spear would. She has not even dated a man yet, and she cannot even imagine being this monk&rsquo;s woman. Her life, which has already been destroyed, is going downhill even more...to a path of no return. Being trapped here and having these monks violate her day and night is a fate worse than death itself. Right now, all she wanted to do was end her own life...but she did not have the will to do it.</p></p>

<p><p>There was something wrong here...everything felt wrong. Her lying on this floor in this room felt wrong, having this deviant on top of her felt wrong...having him say these things to her felt wrong. Faith was saving up her body for her future husband, which is what every woman&rsquo;s dream is. She wanted to experience falling in love and all the joys that come with it...but that dream has been crushed. Her body has been defiled and no man will want her, ever. Even if she&rsquo;s a man, she wouldn&rsquo;t want her either.</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;AM_Cerise_turns_her_over&quot;></a></p></p>

<p><p>Cerise was bored of this position and wanted to violate her front. He turned her body over to face him. He grabbed her by the shoulder and flipped her around, while his leg turned her hips. He leaned in and started to kiss her neck and the neckline, feeling her <strong>flesh</strong> with his face.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith turned her head to the side to avoid his face. At this point, all she can do is focus on something else instead of the pain. Her blank lifeless expression still has not changed. She did not even bother screaming or resisting even a bit. There was nothing she can do to change the past, so why bother? She just let the deviant do whatever he wants with her body while she waited for him to be done. She had no more will to live and no longer cared about what happens to her body.</p></p>

<p><p>He kissed her neckline, the area directly above the <strong>breasts</strong>, and he enjoyed it very much. The sounds of his lips kissing and smacking her skin was audible throughout the room.</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise then moved down to violate her breasts, sucking them with his mouth. He closed his eyes and enjoyed the feast, as a young child would suck on a lollipop with much glee.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s mouth opened slightly and made some noises, but it was still not a scream, only silent gasps and moans.</p></p>

<p><p>His face was stuck between her breasts, he caressed them with his lips while his hands held the outside of the breasts. Cerise enjoyed every second of this, sucking on her breasts and nipples. They were so round and firm and squishy. And the best part of all, she did not fight back, so he could do whatever he wanted without any interruptions. For him to be able to screw a woman in this state, submissive and dominated, is akin to winning the lottery.</p></p>

<p><p>To have a man on top of her was uncomfortable. Her legs were trapped between his legs but they can move a little bit. Her fingers twitched in reaction to his touches. She only had the energy to form half a fist. To be completely dominated by a man...there can be no worst feeling in the world than this.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith wondered why this happening to her... what did she do to deserve this? Is it because she ran away from home? Regardless of the reason, she has already resigned herself to fate, and she&rsquo;s already given up all hope.</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise moved his face up towards her neckline, smothering it all over with kisses. Faith&rsquo;s breathing increased and let out quiet gasps and sighs. It was so quiet it might as well have been silent.</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;AM_Cerise_kisses_her_lips&quot;></a></p></p>

<p><p>Cerise started to move up to her neck and smother it all over with kisses. Then his lips touched her chin and kissed it. Then finally...he kissed her lips. &ldquo;Mmmmmmmmmfffff...&rdquo; Fresh tears instantly swelled down her face.</p></p>

<p><p>Chewing on her lips was like eating a soft and wet candy...but there is no comparison. Candy is sweet but a young woman&rsquo;s lips were ten times sweeter and tastier. There was nothing like the joy of kissing a woman that can no longer fight back. He has her exactly where he wants her, completely submissive and dominated. For Cerise to be able to enjoy a woman like this is heaven.</p></p>

<p><p>But for Faith, this is sheer hell. Even if she is immobile, she was still conscious and felt everything being done to her. He was eating her lips and the inside of her mouth...and every bit of it was disgusting and repulsive.</p></p>

<p><p>When Cerise was done with her lips, he moved his lips on her chin and kissed it, then glided his lips down her neck, kissing and caressing it. Then he started munching on her neckline and her breasts while she suffered silently. Faith turned her sideways to stare at the wall while a stream of tears went halfway down her face.</p></p>

<p><p>For her, that kiss was sheer hell, but for him, it was nothing but a few seconds of enjoyment. He treated her lips like nothing, and now he&rsquo;s violating her body like before. This monk was treating her body like a piece of meat...to them she&rsquo;s not even a person, but a dry ragged doll they can play with and dispose of at anytime.</p></p>

<p><p>The perverted monks have already taken everything away from her - yet they continue to humiliate her further. Haven&rsquo;t they had enough? Apparently not. They are going to keep her as a sex slave and keep using her body until they get tired of her. But when will they ever get tired of this? Probably never...and she may have to be their slave for the rest of eternity.</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;AM_Faith_thinks_of_friends&quot;></a></p></p>

<p><p>At this point, just when she has given up, she thought about her best friend Marianna. If only Marianna was here...she could be saved. She remembered some words of encouragement from Marianna.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith, you&rsquo;re my best friend. But you&rsquo;re more than just that. You have so much potential within you and you don&rsquo;t even know it. With you, I feel like I can see the light. You&rsquo;ve given me hope when I have given up on myself. I&rsquo;d be lost without you. I think you have the potential to save the entire kingdom one day.</p></p>

<p><p>Those were some inspiring words that Faith will never forget. But why would she suddenly think about these words now? One time, when Marianna was playing in the garden, she injured herself. Faith put her hands over her friend&rsquo;s leg and healed the wound without knowing how. Ever since that day, they discovered that Faith has a miraculous healing ability. She saved Marianna, and she has the potential to save many more lives...if only she could harness those healing powers. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before she learns how to control those powers.</p></p>

<p><p>It is true she has so much potential...but all that is wasted. She can save lives, but who will save her? The unthinkable has already happened, so can she saved? No one can turn back the clock to undo what was done to her.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna is not here...Prince Darian is not here. No one is here for her. She is all alone in this room...naked and helpless...alone with this rapist.</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise was enjoying himself, munching and grabbing her breasts to his heart&rsquo;s content. Faith felt everything that was done to her...but still she was unable to react or move. Cerise then moved his head down to her stomach and started kissing it...then slowly moving his lips down to her belly button.</p></p>

<p><p>He continued to move lower and lower...until he reached that vital spot. He put his face on her vital spot and started munching on it while his hands held her thighs for support. It was extremely painful and unbearable. Faith&rsquo;s lips parted and let out a quiet moan. Her head tilted backwards and her pupils dilated. Tears stream down her face.</p></p>

<p><p>Her fingers twitched and her toes curled.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s situation was getting worse by the second. She has already resigned herself to her fate...but how can she just let this atrocity happen?</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna always said to never give up no matter what. The only time to give up is when you&rsquo;re dead. Her words echoed in Faith&rsquo;s mind loudly. What if Marianna shows up and finds her like this? It would be extremely embarrassing...Faith has had embarrassing moments in her life like anyone has, but this would be embarrassment times one thousand. She can&rsquo;t stand the thought that her best friend might see her in this state...practically dead on the inside and laying naked on the floor.</p></p>

<p><p>It became increasingly uncomfortable for her as Cerise kept munching on her lady parts. Whatever physical discomfort she felt, the psychological damage was a thousand times worse.</p></p>

<p><p>When he was done with her lady parts, Cerise started kissing her thigh while caressing it with his hand. He lifted her leg up towards his shoulder. One hand was holding onto her calf while the other caressed her shin. He admired her skin, making sure to caress every inch of it. He put her ankle against his cheek and rubbed it. He kissed her ankle slowly and tantalizingly. He moved his lips down to her shin, kissing every inch towards the knee.</p></p>

<p><p>A woman must take care of her body, it goes without saying. Especially if she&rsquo;s a princess. She has a morning routine and night routine she does daily. Making sure her skin is smooth and flawless...for the sake of appearances. But all that work has gone to waste. She didn&rsquo;t preserve her skin just to be touched by a rapist monk like this...</p></p>

<p><p>He enjoyed the texture of her skin...the skin of a young woman&rsquo;s leg is indescribable. But she did not enjoy it at all. His cheek felt rough and hard, his hands were disgusting, and his lips were wet and repulsive.</p></p>

<p><p>When Cerise was done with her leg, he placed his face onto her stomach and kissed it gently. He glided his lips upwards, making kisses every inch towards her breasts.</p></p>

<p><p>At this moment, she suddenly remembered something important. She has many unfulfilled wishes in her life, but this one is the most prudent to her - to find her long lost brother. Acelot ran away from home a long time ago and Faith has not seen him since. Searching for him was the reason why she ran away from home to begin with.</p></p>

<p><p>If she gives up here she will never find her brother. If she died right now her wish will never be filled for all eternity. So how can she just lay here and let this monk violate her?</p></p>

<p><p>The desire to find Acelot brought some life back to her eyes. Her fingers twitched a little bit. And some feeling returned to her hand.</p></p>

<p><p>She was staring at the wall this whole time but her vision was blurry. But in the corner of her vision she noticed something pink.. She focused her eyes on the object, and it was her towel, hanging off a hook. Her eyes opened wide and more life has returned to them. She was thinking that...if only she had the towel, then she won&rsquo;t be naked...and she will be safe. If she had the towel, she can still have a fighting chance.</p></p>

<p><p>Some feeling returned to her arms. The thought of seeing Marianna, Prince Darian, and Acelot made her want to move again. Right now, she wants to see her father, the king, even though she hated him. She wants to see these people very badly. Her right arm was able to move and she made a grabbing gesture, aiming at the towel. Even though it was far away, in her point of view her hand was grabbing it.</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise&rsquo;s face made his way to her breasts and munched on them like before. It was uncomfortable for her. Her right arm continued to grab the air. She could also feel her left arm.</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;AM_Faith_starts_resisting&quot;></a></p></p>

<p><p>Cerise was done with her breasts and he moved his lips towards her neck. Faith&rsquo;s arms can finally move and pushed his face away. This surprised him a bit and he resisted, pushing his head against her hands. Both her hands were on his face and pushed him further and further away, so he grabbed her wrists and pushed them to the side. He wanted to trap her arms on the floor but it wasn&rsquo;t working and they struggled for a few moments.</p></p>

<p><p>He was on top of her and dominated her physically, but now Faith can move her whole body. While struggling, she kept thrusting her hips against his, as well as using her legs to push him off. She managed to push him to the left, causing him to roll on his side.</p></p>

<p><p>His hands reach for her and she shoved his hands away. She quickly crawled backwards with one arm covering her breasts, while squeezing her legs together. Cerise crawled towards her and grabbed her right leg.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re alive after all.&rdquo; he said.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith screamed and tried to shake him off, but he held on tightly. She kicked him with her left leg, causing him to hit the table with his back. A pan hit his held. *Clunk* More pans fell down and hit him in the head and he fell down in pain.</p></p>

<p> <p><a name=&quot;TheAftermath_2&quot;></a>The Aftermath - 2</p></p>

<p><p>With this chance, Faith turned over to crawl on her knees and elbows. She reached the wall and grabbed onto something to help her stand up. Once the towel was within reach, she snatched it from the rack and wrapped around her body. It was a relief to finally have something to cover herself with. Leaning against the wall, she panted for breath, as her hand clings onto the towel against her chest.</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise appeared from behind her and shoved her against the wall. &ldquo;Uhhh!&rdquo; He put his face against her cheek and pressed his body against hers.</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;You should&rsquo;ve stayed still like a good girl.&rdquo; He kissed her cheek.</p></p>

<p><p>She winced because his lips felt disgusting against her skin. Cerise was in the ideal position to dominate her. His hand pinned her wrists against the wall. He pressed his body firmly against hers and felt her soft body. He put his face into her hair and sighed in pleasure. She could feel his heavy breathing and it sent shivers down her spine.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;If you behave you will suffer less.&rdquo; He started kissing her shoulders while smelling her.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was as helpless as a lamb and just endured the suffering as Cerise violated her from behind. He kissed her shoulders and back all over, moving his face from left to right and right to left. She was extremely uncomfortable as her face was pressed against the concrete and couldn&rsquo;t even see what was happening. During this time, she suddenly recalled something...</p></p>

<p><p>The three monks subdued her, disabling her movements completely. Maroon secured her arms. Magenta secured her stomach and her right leg. Cerise secured her left leg. She thrashed about violently. The monks had to keep a firm grip on her.</p></p>

<p><p>Maroon put his hand on her mouth so she can&rsquo;t scream. &ldquo;Mmmmmffff! Mmmmmfff!&rdquo; Her head kept turning left and right while moaning. Maroon had to use full force to press his hand against her mouth.</p></p>

<p><p>Maroon: &ldquo;So...who gets to screw her first?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise: &ldquo;How&rsquo;s about we all do her at the same time?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Magenta: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a stupid idea. It&rsquo;s impossible to share her like that. We should take turns and enjoy ourselves fully.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tears were streaming down Faith&rsquo;s eyes. She moaned as loud as she could and her head tossed and turned as if she&rsquo;s possessed. Every word the monks said was understood by her, and she desperately wanted escape.</p></p>

<p><p>Growing up as a sheltered princess, she had only a vague idea of what sex is. But she knew even less about rape. She only heard about it through stories, and she was horrified when first learning about it. Even the mere thought of it gave her nightmares. But now, the unthinkable was going to happen to her...right now. Her instincts knew it was going to be a fate worst than death.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mmmmffff! Mmmffff!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise: &ldquo;So the question is who gets to have her first?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Maroon: &ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m the most senior monk here. So I get first dibs.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise: &ldquo;What? That&rsquo;s not fair!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Maroon: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way things are here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Magenta: &ldquo;Tch.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Magenta and Cerise let go of her and move away.</p></p>

<p><p>Maroon removed his hand off her mouth and the screams followed immediately. &ldquo;No! Let me go! Please!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Maroon grabbed her left wrist and secured that arm. Then he lay on top of her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please stop! Please!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He put his face into her neck and violated her. Then he moved down to her cleavage and breasts and stayed there for a while. Her fingers twitched and closed up forming a fist. Her legs thrashed about. He moved his lips down her neck and her breasts and ravaged her. She screamed endlessly while her feet thrashed about.</p></p>

<p><p>Magenta and Cerise were crouching right next to them, watching the action up close.</p></p>

<p><p>Then Maroon kissed her lips. &ldquo;Mmmmmffff!&rdquo; Even more tears dripped down her eyes. Her limbs thrashed about.</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise: &ldquo;Thank goodness. Her screams hurt my ears.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Her muffled moans became more and more pathetic as her lips were being devoured. &ldquo;Mmmmfff...mmmfff!&rdquo; The poor woman continued to suffer a fate worse than death.</p></p>

<p><p>That horrifying memory sent shockwaves throughout her nervous system. If she doesn&rsquo;t resist, the same thing will happen...and she must never let that happen again. Never. Cerise has already done enough damage to her body while she was paralyzed, and even one more touch is unacceptable.</p></p>

<p><p>As Cerise violated her he became more turned on. His hand let go of her wrist and went down to grab her breasts that were squished against the wall. &ldquo;Uhhh! Uhhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith could not take anymore. Using her elbows she pushed the wall as hard as she could and pushed both of them away.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith grabbed the nearest thing she could grab, which is a frying pan that&rsquo;s on the wall, and threw it at him. Cerise blocked with his arm. *Clang* Faith grabbed another utensil and threw it at him. *Clang* Cerise was inching his way towards her.</p></p>

<p><p>She grabbed another frying pan and stepped to the side to avoid him. Cerise and her circled each other as she pointed the pan forward as a weapon. She held the pan with both arms extended fully to keep her distance.</p></p>

<p><p>But the monk was not worried but rather entertained. He noticed that despite her firm grip, her arms were shaking. He looked down and saw her legs were shaking. Her eyes were shaking from fear. Those were the eyes of someone who suffered a lot and didn&rsquo;t want to be hurt anymore. In other words, the eyes of someone who will be easily dominated.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;D-Don&rsquo;t come any closer.&rdquo; Her voice quivered.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ohhh...what&rsquo;re you going to do with that?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;D-Don&rsquo;t...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He noticed the knot on her towel was loosening. &ldquo;Your towel is slipping.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith glanced down and gasped. She quickly retracted her right hand to cling the towel against her breasts. Her left arm was still extended and holding the pan. She did not want the towel to drop again.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, the figurine of Buddha fell off the wall, and hit her head. *Thump*</p></p>

<p><p>Faith grabbed her head and groaned from the pain. Her towel dropped on the floor, and the monks got an eyeful again. Their jaws nearly dropped, and they stared with wide-open eyes without blinking even once.</p></p>

<p><p>When she opened her eyes, she saw the monks staring at her dumbfounded. She looked down, and realized that she was naked. Faith screamed out loud and quickly covered her private parts with both hands, and fell on her knees. She grabbed the towel and covered herself with it.</p></p>

<p><p>Now that she is no longer a threat, Maroon approached her with a wicked smile on his lips. He snatched the towel away from her and she shrieked. Maroon threw the towel to Magenta. He put the towel in his face and sniffed it, sighing in pleasure.</p></p>

<p><p>Without her towel, Faith had nothing to cover herself with except her hands. She was naked, and on her knees, and trapped against the wall.</p></p>

<p><p> Cerise took a step forward and grabbed her wrist and the pan at the same time. He snatched the pan from her and threw it away. *Clank*</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s hands clasped the towel against her chest as she stepped away from him in a circle. Cerise followed her like a hunter would its prey. &ldquo;Running away is pointless. There&rsquo;s no where to go.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith shook her head. &ldquo;S-Stay away...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no where for you to run to. Are you going to run into the forest in that towel?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;D-Don&rsquo;t come closer...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Face it, you&rsquo;re stuck here with us. You&rsquo;re all alone.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;N-No...my friends are waiting for me.&rdquo; In her mind she pictured Marianna and Darian. They continued to circle each other as he taunted her some more.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You mean that man and woman that came to the temple with you? Where are they now, huh? Where are they when you need them?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming for me, I know it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;They abandoned you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> Faith shook her head. &ldquo;No! That&rsquo;s not true. They&rsquo;re coming for me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;Oh yeah? Why didn&rsquo;t they save you when we had our way with you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> Faith&rsquo;s eyes opened wide.</p></p>

<p><p>The woman&rsquo;s screams echoed in the dark temple. &ldquo;No please! Please no!&rdquo; Faith cried out. Cerise had her pinned down from the right side while Maroon secured her right side. Cerise secured her wrist with one hand while the other hand held her leg in place, keeping her knee bent. Maroon secured her wrist and had his knee on her stomach. Magenta was holding onto her ankles to keep her legs in place.</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise squeezed her left breast. &ldquo;Her breasts are so round and firm.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Maroon squeezed the other one. &ldquo;Her nipples are so pink and hard.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith moaned from their touching. She kept pleading to stop over and over.</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise put his face into her breasts and munched on them. Maroon was horny and impatient. He shoved Cerise out of the way. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my turn!&rdquo; He dipped his face into her breasts.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s head tossed and turned and she moaned like hell.</p></p>

<p><p>Her eyes lost some of its light and her lips quivered. Cerise noticed that his words were working on her so he continued to hit her where it hurt the most.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t here when you needed them the most! They&rsquo;ve abandoned you and left you in the darkness!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was in disbelief. At this point her feet stopped moving and she stood still.</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming for me...they&rsquo;re coming for me...&rdquo; All she could do was repeat the same thing over and over. &ldquo;No...no...&rdquo; Faith murmured.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Your friends care about their own lives more than you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be...NO!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Face it, they&rsquo;re not coming back for you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Stop it...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;If they wanted to save you they would have been here already. Instead of leaving you here to suffer alone.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>When Maroon was finally done playing with her chest, it was Magenta&rsquo;s turn to have fun. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take a look at the part that&rsquo;s most important to a woman.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Magenta was kneeling in front of her legs. He grabbed her legs and spread them to the side. His eyes lit up from the view. &ldquo;Ohhhh. So this is what it looks like? Heh...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> The other two monks were staring at her lady parts as well. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best part of a woman&rsquo;s flesh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so pink and plump. I best it&rsquo;s tasty too!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s entire body thrashed about but it was no use. &ldquo;No...please! No!&rdquo; Tears stream down her eyes. She has never been naked in front of a man before. But these deviants have her legs spread wide open and he&rsquo;s looking at her lady parts. This is the most humiliating thing she&rsquo;s ever faced before.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see how it feels.&rdquo; Magenta stuck his fingers in there.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith screamed while her head tossed and turned.</p></p>

<p><p>He kept shoving his fingers in there, moving in and out over and over. Faith&rsquo;s head titled backwards. Tears screamed down her face.</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise and Maroon laughed and snickered while she screamed at the top of her lungs.</p></p>

<p><p>Magenta suddenly had another idea. He snatched up the statue of Buddha that fell earlier and he walked back to the woman&rsquo;s legs. &ldquo;What would happen if I do this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He shoved the statue into her lady parts.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith screamed like she never screamed in her life.</p></p>

<p><p>Maroon: &ldquo;I wonder how deep it can go?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He kept shoving the statue in and out. Judging by her screams they can feel how much it hurts. But they don&rsquo;t care. Her pain is their happiness.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...stop it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You still believe in your friends so much? Even if they wanted to save you they can&rsquo;t because they were killed by Rubeus.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s eyes opened wide again.</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise knew his words were getting to her and he continued to harass her. &ldquo;We were hired by Rubeus to keep you here as a prisoner. And we were told to lead that other woman and man into a trap. We received reports that they&rsquo;ve been killed.&rdquo; It was a lie since he received no such report. They have no intel on the whereabouts of Marianna or Darian. But he wanted to keep messing with this woman&rsquo;s head.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...you&rsquo;re lying...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t sense them anymore, can you? They&rsquo;re not coming back.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...they&rsquo;re coming f-for m-me...&rdquo; She was at her breaking point. Her eyes have lost its luster.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You know the truth, don&rsquo;t you? You&rsquo;re in denial.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...stop it. Stop it!&rdquo; Her hands covered her ears and she shook her head left and right.</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise was enjoying this, as if he&rsquo;s dealing with a child. Besides sexual torture, he enjoyed mental torture too. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way to undo what happened. I already know your body inside and out.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith shook her head harder. &ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>With nothing holding onto the towel, it dropped to her feet. *Plop*</p></p>

<p><p> Cerise got an eye of her frontal nudity. Even though he saw this moments ago, it was still refreshing to see it again. He had no idea that his taunts would have this effect on her. It was a nice bonus - it saves him the effort of having to waste energy stripping her.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith shrieked and covered her private parts. She was weak-kneed and fell down on her knees and palms. She was facing the floor, her body trembling in despair. Cerise kneeled next to her and held her by the shoulders. He whispered into her ear. &ldquo;Forget about your friends. This is your home now. At least you have a place to eat and sleep. It&rsquo;s better than wandering around isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He made her face him. &ldquo;And all you have to do is be our slave. This is like paradise isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t even have time to process how wrong those words were.</p></p>

<p><p>He leaned in and kissed her lips. Tears streamed down her lifeless eyes. During the lip lock, he pushed her onto the floor and now he was on top of her. With their lips still locked, he positioned his lower body to be on top of hers, and now he was in a position of complete dominance.</p></p>

<p><p>He finished the kiss to take a breath. Then he put his face into her neck and cleavage and continued what he started earlier. Like before, she was paralyzed from head to toe. As she was being violated, her fingers twitched as if squeezing an imaginary ball.</p></p>

<p><p>The two heroes returned to the staircase that leads to the monk&rsquo;s temple. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve figured it out.&rdquo; Darian blurted out.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna stared at him blankly. &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It all makes sense now. Why did the demons keep attacking the same village over and over? And why did Rubeus appear during that same time?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Rubeus is a sorcerer. Demons usually are scattered and disorganized. Yet at Sunrise Village, they attack in groups.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna paused. &ldquo;Wait, are you saying that Rubeus is somehow controlling the demons&rsquo; activities?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only explanation. When I was a prince, I had access to the imperial library. I used to spend days reading books, and one day I came across a particular book on sorcery and the black arts. It said that in order to open a portal to the underworld, you need a large amount of soul energy...human souls. In other words, sacrifice many lives.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So Rubeus is trying to open a portal to the underworld? And to do that he&rsquo;s...&rdquo; Suddenly she gasped. &ldquo;Sunrise Village is in trouble!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We can talk about it later. We have a princess to rescue.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna looked at Darian and nodded and smiled. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They ran towards the front gate, and upon seeing them, the monks gasped in surprise. Marianna recognized the two monks as Cerise and Carmine.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still alive?!&rdquo; Cerise exclaimed, pointing at Marianna. &ldquo;I thought Rubeus&rsquo;s men finished you off?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I see...&rdquo; said Marianna. &ldquo;So you <strong>were </strong>working with Rubeus.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darian finished her thought. &ldquo;This temple is a trap for us, isn&rsquo;t it? The rumors of demons appearing here were false...it&rsquo;s to trick us to come here so we will fall under your trap. The only demons here are you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Carmine and Cerise grabbed wooden sticks. &ldquo;Heh, we&rsquo;re just peaceful monks who followed orders.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re nothing but greedy lowlifes!&rdquo; Darian drew his sword and charged at the two monks. Carmine swings his wooden stick at him, but Darian&rsquo;s blade cut the stick in two, and cut the monk&rsquo;s chest as well. <strong>Blood</strong> splattered from his wound and he coughed blood as he collapsed.</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise, seeing his fallen friend, grew angry, and attacked Darian with his stick. *Wham* Darian blocked it with his sword.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Go now!&rdquo; Darian yelled.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; Marianna ran into the temple. At this time of night, it was completely dark, the only light coming from burning candles.</p></p>

<p><p>At the end of the hallway, Magenta and Maroon were seen, holding weapons.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh, so you&rsquo;re back, eh?&rdquo; said Magenta. &ldquo;You should&rsquo;ve stayed dead.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; Marianna asked, as if she is the boss.</p></p>

<p><p>Magenta smiled. &ldquo;Heh, you&rsquo;re not getting her back, not until you beat us.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Beat you?&rdquo; Marianna replied. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s easier done than said.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Both the monks grew angry. &ldquo;Why you...&rdquo; Magenta charged first, while Marianna dropped her sword.</p></p>

<p><p>Magenta ran towards her with the intent of giving her all his anger through his stick. Marianna took out her bow and loaded an arrow before he was halfway to her. She fired the arrow and hit his thigh, causing him to fall.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh!! My leg!&rdquo; Magenta could no longer stand up, and kneeled there, wailing and crying in agony.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Damn you!&rdquo; Maroon rushed at Marianna and swings his stick, but Marianna dodged it swiftly.</p></p>

<p><p>Maroon was confused for a moment, wondering where his target was. Marianna was behind him, and Maroon turned around and raised his stick high, ready to swing it down. Marianna released the arrow, and it went through the stick and into his chest.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ughhh...&rdquo; The pain struck him by surprise. Maroon looked down, shocked to see an arrow inside his chest, and blood dripping on his clothes. Without any time to acknowledge his defeat, his body gave up and he fell down. *Splat*</p></p>

<p><p>After that, Marianna went over to the fallen Magenta. &ldquo;Help me!&rdquo; he cried out, his hand reaching forward.</p></p>

<p><p>Maroon backed away. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re on your own man!&rdquo; He ran away.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Looks like you fallen monks don&rsquo;t uphold values of friendship.&rdquo; said Marianna.</p></p>

<p><p>He was crying like a little baby and when he saw Marianna come over. He crawled back to the wall. &ldquo;No...please! Have mercy!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna didn&rsquo;t even bother to strike him. &ldquo;Tch. You are pretty weak. I can&rsquo;t waste any more time here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Having been to the temple only once, Marianna was not familiar with the hallways. But she was able to sense Faith, somehow, and determine her location. This has never happened before to Marianna, and she wonders why she knows where Faith is. It&rsquo;s as if she can feel her friend&rsquo;s life force from where she is. Is this the instinct of a best friend...or something else?</p></p>

<p><p>In any case, Marianna found her friend in a dark room. Faith was curled up in the corner, sitting against the wall. Her face was buried in her knees and she did not react to the sound of the door opening. She was still wearing a pink towel. Mari noticed something was different about her friend but unable to pinpoint what it was.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Faith?&rdquo; Mari walked over. &ldquo;Faith. It&rsquo;s me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith unburied her head to look up. One would expect her to be full of joy and her eyes to light up. She was indeed in disbelief to see her best friend but her reaction was slow. She just stared at Mari with a blank expression on her face. She was so damaged physically and mentally that even seeing her best friend didn&rsquo;t restore the light in her eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I came here to rescue you. You&rsquo;re free now.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Her friend still showed no reaction. Mari still didn&rsquo;t know why she was acting this way. But suddenly it came to her. She was wearing nothing but a towel...and she was captured by the greedy monks...it could only mean one thing. Mari kneeled down.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. It&rsquo;s okay now.&rdquo; Mari grabbed her friend by the hand and helped her stand up. Actually it was more like she had to drag her friend up on her feet. Still holding her by the hand like she would a child, Mari took her out of the dark room.</p></p>

<p><p> *Wham* Darian slammed Fuchsia against the wall, pointing a sword at his chin. &ldquo;Why did you betray us?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The old monk raised his palms up. &ldquo;Please, young man...we had no choice.&rdquo; he said, his voice quivering. &ldquo;Rubeus threatened our lives.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darian noticed how scared the monk was of him. He did not like this situation one bit...it makes him feel like the bad guy. The monk was very old, maybe in his eighties and his ethics won&rsquo;t allow him to hurt an elderly man. &ldquo;Tch. Some noble monks you are.&rdquo; Darian put his sword back into its sheath and walked away.</p></p>

<p><p>Fuchsia feel on his knees and palms and gasped for breath. His life was spared and he escaped death due to luck.</p></p>

<p><p>Mari dragged Faith by the hand to take her to the prayer room, the largest room in the temple. With her right hand being held, Faith&rsquo;s left hand clinging was still clinging the towel against her breast. Even though she was in a mindless state, her womanly instincts were still active.</p></p>

<p><p>Darian came back to check up on the two ladies. &ldquo;Is the princess okay?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; Mari replied. She let go of Faith&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;What happened to the others?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The monks were a bunch of weaklings so I didn&rsquo;t bother with them. I tried to get information out of one of them. But they don&rsquo;t know anything.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;When I injured one of them, the rest of them didn&rsquo;t help their friend...they left him for dead. They&rsquo;re a bunch of lowlifes.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Did you kill him?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t even worth killing. The guy I injured...what was his name? I think it was Magenta. He begged for his life.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith had a reaction when she heard that name. Her eyes opened wider and her breathing became irregular. Her left hand dropped to the side, leaving nothing to hold the towel in place. It slipped and fell to the floor. <strong>*Plop*</strong></p></p>

<p><p>Darian saw everything and his jaw dropped. Marianna&rsquo;s jaw dropped as well. Faith wondered why they were staring at her like that. Then she felt that nothing was covering her body and she looked down and shrieked. She kneeled and picked up the towel and draped it against her body.</p></p>

<p><p>Darian looked away while Marianna jumped in front of Faith. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry...&rdquo; said the embarrassed prince.</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="g">[ G ] - The Recovery 
</span></p></center>


<p><p>Darian and Marianna took Faith back to an <strong>abandoned house</strong> where they will stay for the next three days. Mari and Darian had to nurse each other&rsquo;s wounds they received from falling off the cliff. Faye stayed in a room of her own - it was so small that it was like a prison cell. There was hay on the floor and no room for a bed or anything else. There was only a window and hay on the floor. She did not care about any of this...this physical prison is a manifestation of the prison inside her heart.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna entered the room. Faye was wearing her usual outfit - a pink blouse with baggy pink pants and toeless shoes. She sat on the floor with her back against the wall and she has been staring at the window without moving a muscle. One can presume that she hasn&rsquo;t this whole time.</p></p>

<p><p>Mari put a tray of food next to her friend. Faye was unresponsive.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s beef stew. You should eat it while it&rsquo;s hot.&rdquo; said Marianna.</p></p>

<p><p>Still, Faith did not respond or even look at her, and continued to stare at the window with a sad look in her eyes. Marianna grew frustrated but remained patient.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You must be hungry. Try some.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not hungry.&rdquo; Faye finally responded. Her eyes have no light and her voice was low and monotone.</p></p>

<p><p>Mari was getting worrisome. &ldquo;Look...you need energy to recover and you can&rsquo;t recover on an empty stomach. I know beef stew is your favorite.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>There was no response.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for what happened to you. But please eat something.&rdquo; Mari stood up and walked out of the room. If she stayed in there she would get mad and end up yelling. Faith is her best friend after all and she does not want to see her in such bad shape. She had a slight hope that the smell of the stew will make Faye hungry enough to eat it.</p></p>

<p><p>Darian came by and asked Marianna: &ldquo;Any luck?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s like she&rsquo;s dead on the inside. I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I will comfort her.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darian, upon walking into the room full of hay, headed for the window and stared at the full moon.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Princess...ahem, I mean Faith. You haven&rsquo;t touched your food.&rdquo; There was no response. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t stay like this forever. Marianna is worried about you.&rdquo; After a few seconds of silence, Darian kneeled down in front of her. Faye still didn&rsquo;t look at him, but continued to stare blankly at the window. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just trying to help.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need help.&rdquo; Faye replied. &ldquo;Just leave me be.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The look in your eyes is the same...the same as mine. I&rsquo;ve had that look for the longest time.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faye finally showed some reaction as her eyeballs glanced at him for a second.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the look of anger and the desire for revenge. All those feelings are festering inside of you...you feel helpless, don&rsquo;t you? I felt the same when I lost my kingdom...and everything that I held dear to me.&rdquo; One can tell Darian was speaking from his true feelings.</p></p>

<p><p>Although his read on her was wrong - her look wasn&rsquo;t one of anger but helplessness and resignation - however him talking about his pain made her pay attention.</p></p>

<p><p>Darian noticed her words were getting through to her so he continued. &ldquo;I thought to myself...if only I had the power. If only I could&rsquo;ve prevented the tragedy from happening. But it&rsquo;s up to you what you want to do with this anger. You can let it make you depressed, or you can do something about it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all?&rdquo; she asked coldly.</p></p>

<p><p>The prince was startled. He thought he was getting through...so he did not expect a reaction like that. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t let this tragedy ruin your life.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a man, how can you possibly understand a <strong>woman&rsquo;s suffering</strong>?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darian became silent as he did not have a response to that. She was right though, men and women are opposites. Men don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to be violated by another man...it&rsquo;s just not something that a man should be giving advice on. Not only that, the way that Faye said it...with that dead expression of hers really hit him hard. Suddenly he became angry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make this right somehow! I&rsquo;ll make those monks pay!&rdquo; He stormed out of the room and slammed the door.</p></p>

<p><p>Judging by the sound of the door slamming, Mari knew it didn&rsquo;t go well. &ldquo;No luck either huh?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darian walked past her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to do something about it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wait...you don&rsquo;t mean...are you going back to that place?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The prince did not answer her inquiry and left the house.</p></p>

<p><p>Mari came into the small room carrying a cup of water. &ldquo;I thought you might get thirsty.&rdquo; She placed it on the tray of food. She noticed that the food hasn&rsquo;t been touched and she grew annoyed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Faith, you haven&rsquo;t eaten for three days. And you still won&rsquo;t talk to me.&rdquo; Marianna&rsquo;s patience has officially run out. She grabbed her friend by the shoulders ad shook her. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t keep going on like this!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Being shaken like that was annoying, but the girl has lost all the light in her soul so she just allowed it to happen. She glanced at her friend&rsquo;s eyes, then stared at the floor. &ldquo;Just let me be.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>At this time, Marianna had a flashback. She reminded her friend of these memories.</p></p>

<p><p> When the two girls were younger, they were hanging out in the vast garden of the imperial palace. Faye and Mari would run about the grass fields until they were out of breath, then they&rsquo;d lie down on the grass and stare at the clouds. One such day, while they were catching their breath after some exercise, they started to talk about the future.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith pointed at a cloud. &ldquo;That one looks like a sheep.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah! And that one is like a cow!&rdquo; Mari replied.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It does not look like a cow.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You have to look at it from a certain angle.&rdquo; said Mari. &ldquo;Tilt your head slightly to the left.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith did as instructed. &ldquo;Ohh. You&rsquo;re right, it does kinda look like a cow!&rdquo; Both girls burst into laughter.</p></p>

<p><p>They both calmed down from the laughing and then Marianna broke the silence. &ldquo;Say Faith, have you ever left the palace on your own?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, never.&rdquo; Faith answered. &ldquo;I rarely get to go out, and when I do, I&rsquo;m always accompanied by guards. But one day...I am going to leave the palace and explore the world.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ehhh? You&rsquo;re going to leave the palace? Your father will never let you do that.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith did not change her resolve. &ldquo;I know. But I can&rsquo;t live in this palace all my life. There are so many cities and villages in the kingdom, so many people to see, and things to eat that are different than our own. And I heard that traveling is lots of fun!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ohhh. I want to have fun too.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Say, Marianna. When I leave one day, will you come with me?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You betcha. I&rsquo;m tired of being a thief. Maybe being a traveler isn&rsquo;t so bad.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Little did Faith know, her dream might come sooner than she thought. One day, King Midas gave her a lecture about being friends with a thief. He forbids Faith to associate with a thief, and she fought him tooth and nail, but it was no use, the old man was too stubborn to listen. As a result, Midas grounded his daughter, forbidding her to leave her room.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith became so fed up with this and decided that tonight is the night that she makes her escape. She isn&rsquo;t cut out to be princess, and it&rsquo;s time for her to chase her dreams.</p></p>

<p><p>Tying the curtains into a rope, she made her escape out the window without being detected. After sneaking out of the palace, she met up with Mari.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure you want to do this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already made up my mind. I am not turning back.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Do you remember? We&rsquo;re best friends. We always open up to each other.&rdquo; Despite her words of encouragement, there was still no reaction from Faye.</p></p>

<p><p>By now, even Marianna was losing hope. She was grief stricken over her best friend&rsquo;s current state. She used to be so upbeat and cheerful...but look at her now. She has gotten skinny and weak and can&rsquo;t even speak properly...no different than a living corpse. This person lying before her is not her friend...no it&rsquo;s not the same person.</p></p>

<p><p>On a particularly warm summer day, the two girls sat on the grass plains of the palace grounds. Faith suddenly stood up. &ldquo;Hey Marianna. Have you ever thought about the future?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The future?&rdquo; she replied blankly.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Uh huh. Like what you plan to do in the future? Is there any you&rsquo;ve always wanted to do?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well. I certainly don&rsquo;t want to be a thief forever. Maybe I&rsquo;ll find a prince and marry him.&rdquo; Mari replied. &ldquo;What about you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faye turned towards the sun. &ldquo;Sometimes I feel trapped in this palace...it&rsquo;s like a prison. But one day I&rsquo;ll break out of this prison and see the world and all it has to offer. I know I&rsquo;m meant for much bigger things than being a princess. I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot of news and the outside world is suffering.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. I was born in the ghettos so I had no choice but to become a thief.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faye then turned to face her friend. The sun was directly behind her head. &ldquo;If there was more kindness in this world then people won&rsquo;t have to suffer anymore. There won&rsquo;t be any starvation, crime or murder. The only way to kill someone is to kill them with kindness.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mari&rsquo;s eyes opened wide as if she&rsquo;s seen the light...figuratively and literally. It wasn&rsquo;t just Faith&rsquo;s words that had an impact...but the way she said it and the fact that the sun was behind her made her look enlightened. She had no words to say...Faith&rsquo;s message was so pure and inspiring that she didn&rsquo;t want to taint her message.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was still a teenager when she made that speech so it wasn&rsquo;t that long ago. But all it took was one tragedy to destroy all that enthusiasm and hope. This hurt Marianna more than words can describe. Her best friend was such a nice girl and pure of heart...but the light in her eyes has been snuffed out. And it&rsquo;s all because those fallen monks did something unforgivable to her...it&rsquo;s something that should never happen to any woman.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna leaned into her friend to give her a hug. &ldquo;I swear I&rsquo;ll return you to normal.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith felt the warmth of the hug and also the conviction in Mari&rsquo;s words. Unfortunately, she still showed little to no reaction to this warm gesture.</p></p>

<p><p> Now that the princess was once again alone, she continued to stare at the moon outside the window. Her head was turned to the side as she leaned against the wall. She regretted driving Marianna and Darian away but she was in so much pain she didn&rsquo;t know what else to do. Tears drip down her lifeless eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>She abandoned them because she abandoned herself.</p></p>

<p><p>The three monks have her surrounded, she was against the wall, and that means escape is impossible. She was naked and helpless, kneeling on the ground, her arms covering her private parts. Their devilish laughter echoed through the room, their leering eyes were glowing red, piercing the darkness. These monks were not men, they were more like beasts...or rather, demons.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now, why don&rsquo;t we have some fun&#8230;&rdquo; Maroon&rsquo;s hand reached for her.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s eyes were shaking in fear and tears dripped from her eyes. &ldquo;No&#8230;please!&rdquo; She was directly in front of the wall, so she was completely trapped.</p></p>

<p><p>Maroon bent down to her level and his hand grabbed her hair. Tears drip down her face as she stared at him frightfully. &ldquo;Stop...please....&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Maroon forced his lips into hers, and the tears streamed down her face like a river. For this man to kiss her like this, it has to be the single worst moment of her life...yet it&rsquo;s only the beginning of the end.</p></p>

<p><p>That recent memory still haunts her to this very moment. She did not want to think about it but her mind was running on its own. The memory was so vivid and painful that Faith&rsquo;s hands grab the hay and squeezed it.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith has been sitting in the same spot for an unknown amount of time. It could be minutes, hours or days. Her stomach was growling. The sound was clearly audible in the silent, empty room. For the first time in days, she wanted to eat something just to calm her stomach. There was a tray of food across the room - but the room was small, only ten feet wide.</p></p>

<p><p>Her arm reached for the beef stew but her body remained in place so her arm was dangling there.</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;Recovery_MealTime&quot;></a>Meal Time</p></p>

<p><p>In the dark storage room Faith was lying naked, her arms diagonal, her legs slightly apart. She was in here for an unknown amount of time. There was no way to track how many hours or days or weeks she&rsquo;s been in this room.</p></p>

<p><p>Magenta came into the room with a tray of food. He placed the tray close to her shoulder. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s dinner time.&rdquo; he said with much glee. He was finished with his chores and his reward was to be able to see Faith again. Seeing a naked woman&rsquo;s body gave him much joy. The temple was a boring place - the decoration was boring, the food was boring and the chores were boring. But this is the highlight of his day, to be in this room alone with a naked defenseless woman.</p></p>

<p><p>He put the spoon into the bowl to scoop up some congee, then put the spoon on her lips. &ldquo;Eat this.&rdquo; he said.</p></p>

<p><p>But her lips did not open. She remained lifeless like a statue.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Eat it while it&rsquo;s hot.&rdquo; he said. He kept gently pushing the spoon between her lips but they still would not open. He thought he&rsquo;d just use brute force and pry them open with the spoon if he pushed hard enough.</p></p>

<p><p>She tilted her head to the side and the congee spilled on the <strong>corner of her mouth and chin</strong>.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh. You made me waste all that food.&rdquo; Magenta grew frustrated. She was no different than a child who refused to eat. He grabbed her by the neck and forced her head to face up. &ldquo;In the temple food is scarce so we do not waste it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>His grip on her neck tightened, forcing her mouth open, then he shoved the food inside. She did not want the food inside her mouth. But she didn&rsquo;t have the energy to spit it out, so she had no choice but to swallow the congee. It tasted bland.</p></p>

<p><p>He took out a napkin. &ldquo;Look at the mess you&rsquo;ve made.&rdquo; He was about to wipe her mouth, but then he got a wicked idea.</p></p>

<p><p>He lowered his face to meet hers. He licked the congee off her cheek... and his <strong>tongue</strong> brushed against the <strong>corner of her lips</strong>. His slimy, wet tongue touched her slowly and tantalizingly. It felt disgusting to have a man lick her in such a way and every second felt like an hour. Her head turned to the right.</p></p>

<p><p>Then a wicked smile grew upon his face. &ldquo;Oh I get it. You want me to feed you mouth to mouth eh?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Magenta poured the congee into his mouth and lowered his face to meet hers. He planted his lips into hers, forcing her mouth open, and the food spilled into her mouth. This came as a surprise to Faith. Her eyes opened wider. The food was in her mouth and she was forced to swallow. *gulp gulp* It went down her neck. Her elbow twitched and her fingers flexed. When he was done with the kiss he lifted his head up to look at her. He noticed that she had a slight reaction to the feeding, which he enjoyed.</p></p>

<p><p>He dipped the spoon over her breasts and the congee spilled on her breasts. &ldquo;Oops.&rdquo; he said. Then he poured some congee on her stomach, making a straight line. to her belly button. &ldquo;Ohhh. What a mess. I guess somebody has to clean it up.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He lowered his face to her <strong>stomach</strong> and licked the congee off - very slowly. He glided his tongue in a straight line moving up. His tongue touched her belly button and he dipped his tongue in there, making sure to get every drop of congee.</p></p>

<p><p>Magenta stayed there for a while, as it&rsquo;s not every day he gets to see a woman&rsquo;s belly button. He is by nature a weakling who relies on his other monks to get his prey, whenever they get a woman to play with he always has to share. But right now, he gets to be alone with this naked woman, so he is going to enjoy it fully. He will explore every inch of her body while taking his sweet time.</p></p>

<p><p>He continued to move to the bottom of her breasts. He made sure the congee covered most of her <strong>breasts</strong> including the nipple. He placed his hands on the floor for support and started to dig in. By far this was his favorite part - he licked off every drop of congee on her breasts, leaving no area untouched.</p></p>

<p><p>He glided his wet, slimy tongue to the nipple and licked the <strong>nipple</strong> as well. He slurped the nipple over and over while his hands squeezed her breasts. Then he started to suck on her breast like an infant drinking breast milk.</p></p>

<p><p>At this point he forgot that he was supposed to feed her. But he was so turned on that he did not care. This is what feeding time should be - this time and every time from now on.</p></p>

<p><p>When he was done with that, he started sucking the other breast. Then he dug his face into the valley between hills and let his tongue run wild. There was no congee but he wanted taste her bare skin.</p></p>

<p><p>He wanted to lick food off other parts of her body. He poured congee on her <strong>shin</strong>, making a straight line to the knee. He lay himself on his stomach and positioned himself so he is sideways to her leg. He lifted her by the calf a few inches off the floor and began licking, starting from the bottom. As always, he did it slowly to savor the taste. The congee tasted bland but her skin tasted much better.</p></p>

<p><p>*Sleeerp sleeerp* He became more aggressive as he glided his tongue back and forth. Some of his saliva remained on her skin, only to be licked dry again.</p></p>

<p><p>He poured the congee all over her <strong>thigh</strong> and some on her <strong>vagina</strong>. Starting from the knee, he licked his way to her thigh. He also licked the outside thigh and the inside thigh.</p></p>

<p><p>He inched his way towards her vagina...and then he dug in. Faith&rsquo;s eyes widened as he was eating the congee off her lady parts. This was the inevitable...there was no use hoping it wouldn&rsquo;t happen. After a long time, Magenta was finally done violating her lady parts and removed his face from it to take a break.</p></p>

<p><p>After exploring so many parts of her body, he wanted to explore her lips again. He put more food into his mouth and then lay on top of her. He placed his hand on her forearms and lowered his face so that they were face to face.</p></p>

<p><p>He placed his <strong>lips</strong> into hers and forced her mouth open...and the food spilled into her mouth. She had an immediate reaction to this. Her eyes opened wide open. Her arms shuddered but didn&rsquo;t move an inch as they were held in place. His hands slid down her forearm and secured her wrists.</p></p>

<p><p>The food was in her mouth and she was forced to swallow. *gulp gulp* It went down her neck. His hand moved even lower and secured her fingers. Now their fingers were locked on both right and left hand. Tears streamed from the corner of her eyes and hit the floor silently. Her legs shuddered and her toes curled and brushed against his pants.</p></p>

<p><p>There was no more food left to swallow but Magenta remained like this, his lips planted into hers. He was enjoying the kiss too much and continued to suck on her lips.</p></p>

<p><p>Even though she was paralyzed, she was not completely immune to what was being done to her body. This probably the worst case scenario - to be unable to move yet still feel the torture on your body. Faith was no better than a vegetable...which is exactly what the monks want.</p></p>

<p><p>There is something very wrong with this picture. Not only was Magenta feeding her through her mouth, but their fingers were interlocked as if they were lovers. She has never faced such humiliation before...no one has ever fed her through the mouth like this. It was disgusting on every level...her mouth was violated on the outside and inside. This was more painful than death itself.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Faith was lying on the floor. She wasn&rsquo;t even facing the food, but rather, crawled towards the wall in front of her. These flashbacks not only hurt her mind, but her spirit and body as well. She crawled an inch before stopping. She literally didn&rsquo;t know how to deal with what happened to her in the temple. Her fingers squeezed the hay tightly because she felt as if she&rsquo;s being violated right now.</p></p>

<p><p>Back at the temple, the monks were cleaning up the mess caused by the previous fight. Several of them had brooms and they were sweeping the floor. Fuschia was fixing things on the table. All of them with the exception of Fushia was injured in some way and had bandages in various parts of their body. Carmine had bandages over his chest and his right forearm.</p></p>

<p><p> Upon hearing footsteps, the monks became startled. Darian entered the room. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re back!&rdquo; said Carmine. He ran to the wall to grab a wooden stick.</p></p>

<p><p>Darian&rsquo;s sword was already drawn. He swings it at Carmine, breaking the stick and cut his leg. &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; He fell down.</p></p>

<p><p>The other monks ran away. &ldquo;Hey don&rsquo;t leave me behind!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re on your own!&rdquo; said Magenta.</p></p>

<p><p>Darian approached the fallen Carmine. &ldquo;Looks like your friends don&rsquo;t care about you as much as their own lives. You are an insult to real monks.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wait, don&rsquo;t kill me. You&rsquo;re after my life, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No. I still have a use for you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faye was asleep on the hay, lying in the position she was earlier. She awoke upon hearing the loud slam of the metallic door opening. She turned around to lie down on her back. Mari extended her hand. &ldquo;I have something you need to see.&rdquo; Faye obediently took her friend&rsquo;s hand and consequently she was able to stand up with help.</p></p>

<p><p>When the two went to the living room, Faith gasped and stepped back. Carmine was on his knees with Darian standing next to him.</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;OldMonkTemptation&quot;></a>The Old Monk's Temptation</p></p>

<p><p>In the room down the hallway, Fuchsia and Carmine were playing poker. The temple is a boring place with almost nothing to do. When they were done with cleaning duty, these two usually past time by playing cards for money. Just now, they heard a noise from outside.</p></p>

<p><p>Fuchsia became alarmed. &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Could it be a thief?&rdquo; said Carmine.</p></p>

<p><p>They both got scared and took precautions. Fuchsia grabbed a wooden stick and stood by the left side of the door, whereas Carmine stood by the right side. If the intruder were to enter, they&rsquo;d have the element of surprise.</p></p>

<p><p>As they waited, footsteps can be heard in the darkness. They grew louder by the step, so the monks knew the intruder was coming in this room.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Faith ran into the room, and Fuchsia hit her on the head. *Whack* She fell down.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; Fuchsia exclaimed, dropping the stick.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a thief?&rdquo; asked Carmine.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What have I done?!&rdquo; said Fuchsia</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s our guest, Miss Faith. And she&rsquo;s naked.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We have to do something!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Carmine bent down and turned her over. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right...we need to do something...we should take advantage of her while we can.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Fuchsia gasped. &ldquo;What? No that&rsquo;s wrong&#8230;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Everyone else had fun with her. Why not us?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Carmine stared at the woman&rsquo;s body, clad only in a pink towel. He put his hand on her right breast and squeezed it like play dough. Then he put both hands on her breasts and played with them. Faith moaned in her sleep. &ldquo;Uhhh...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Fuchsia was completely against his friend&rsquo;s actions. &ldquo;No, you must stop this...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, what&rsquo;s the harm in doing this?&rdquo; He continued to squeeze her breasts. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have desires too, old man?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Fuchsia did not reply, and instead, stared at his friend while he engaged in debauchery with the unconscious woman.</p></p>

<p><p>Carmine started touching Faith&rsquo;s thighs. &ldquo;This is the skin of a young woman. When&rsquo;s the last time felt a young woman&rsquo;s flesh?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Fuchsia started to sweat a little bit, watching Carmine&rsquo;s hand get closer and closer to the gap between her legs. He swallowed hard.</p></p>

<p><p>Carmine put his hand between her legs, causing her to moan louder. &ldquo;Uhhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Fuchsia was born and raised a Buddhist, and he has followed the ways of the monk for decades. But despite all that training, he still cannot rid his desire for a woman&rsquo;s skin - no matter what, deep down inside he is still a man.</p></p>

<p><p>Indeed, being in a temple, he has not even seen a woman in many years. Especially not a naked woman. Yet there is a naked woman lying before him, clad in only a towel, and completely unconscious and helpless. She is ripe for the picking.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith moaned in her sleep as Carmine was rummaging in her private parts. Fuchsia&rsquo;s repressed desires start to surface as he observed his fellow monk violate this girl&rsquo;s privates. Fuchsia wonders what is between her legs, and gazed at the area where Carmine&rsquo;s hand is. Even a monk is curious about a woman&rsquo;s body - what exactly is in the void that is between those legs? Faith&rsquo;s legs thrashed about as she was being violated, and she moaned a little. Fuchsia watched the whole thing without blinking, and he swallowed hard.</p></p>

<p><p>Fuchsia likes the way that her face looks when she&rsquo;s moaning. Her eyes are closed and they twitch while she&rsquo;s in pain, and her eyelashes are pretty. And the way her lips look so plump, like a fruit that is ready to be bitten into. And the way she sounds when she moans. Perhaps Carmine is right, he cannot repress his sexual nature while witnessing this feat.</p></p>

<p><p>Carmine was enjoying it, judging by the perverted look in his face. Then he lifted up her leg and rubbed it against his face. Then he looked at Fuchsia. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to feel this woman&rsquo;s skin? It feels so good...&rdquo; Indeed, he liked the feel of the soft texture of her thigh against his cheek and lips, and rubbed it back and forth.</p></p>

<p><p>Fuchsia was becoming turned on, and Carmine knew it was working. For some reason, he got a kick out of tempting this reserved old man, and at the same time, enjoying himself as he violated this poor woman. Carmine began licking her leg with his tongue, gliding it along her ankle, and moving it to her shin, and her knee, and her upper thigh.</p></p>

<p><p>Fuchsia, no long able to control himself, grabbed Faith&rsquo;s other leg.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right...&rdquo; Carmine said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to try it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Fuchsia was hesitant to do anything, so Carmine grabbed Fuchsia&rsquo;s hand and guided it to various parts of her leg.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right...feel the warmth of her skin. Now...&rdquo; Carmine let go of Fuchsia&rsquo;s hand, so that he can do it himself.</p></p>

<p><p>Fuchsia lifted her leg up so he can observe it closely. He brushed his hand along her ankle, down to her shin and down to her thigh.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;There you go...you can do it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Fuchsia&rsquo;s hand grew closer and closer to the towel. His face became ecstatic, like that of a little kid about to open a present. Finally, his hand has reached into her private spot, causing Faith to scream out loud.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Faith&rsquo;s eyes opened and she came into consciousness. The very first thing she saw were two perverted men, and one of them has his hands on her legs. She screamed and trashed about. &ldquo;Aaaah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s thigh hit Fuchsia&rsquo;s chin, knocking him down. Then Carmine grabbed her other leg and pinned it down. She kicked and thrashed about, until her leg hit Carmine in the neck, knocking him away.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith crawled backwards to get as far away from them as she can. Carmine crawled towards her, with a wicked smile on his face. &ldquo;Come here, you.&rdquo; he taunted. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be scared. We&rsquo;re not going to hurt you...unless if you resist.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She crawled until her back hit the wall, and now that there&rsquo;s no room to run to, she gasped, putting her arm over her face. Her eyes were shaking in fear, and her limbs were trembling.</p></p>

<p><p>Carmine thought he had her where he wants her, backed up against the corner, like prey waiting to be devoured by its predator. Because her legs were folded, he could see the area that&rsquo;s under the towel, the void that&rsquo;s between her legs. His eyes widened and he had this stupid smile on his face, which gave away what he saw. Faith gasped, and quickly shut her legs, and pressed the bottom of the towel tightly against her spot.</p></p>

<p><p>Carmine leapt at her, and she kicked him in the chin, knocking him down. Faith quickly stood up with her back against the wall. She inched her way down to the end of the room, but there was only a corner. Carmine approached her with a perverted grabbing gesture.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith didn&rsquo;t know what to do, and just turned sideways to avoid his grabs. &ldquo;No...&rdquo; she whimpered like a frightened mouse. The monk grabbed her arms and pressed his body up against hers, and smelled her hair. She winced from disgust.</p></p>

<p><p>Then he went lower, and kissed her back. Faith moaned in pain. He put his lips next to her ears. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry baby...it might hurt at first. But you&rsquo;ll get used to it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Those words sent chills down her spine. Which one is more disgusting, the fact that he&rsquo;s violating her from the back, or the fact that he&rsquo;s whispering dirty words to her, as if they were making love?</p></p>

<p><p>Something in Faith&rsquo;s psych snapped and her fingers clenched into fists, and she pushed herself off the wall, which pushed Carmine as well. He was caught by surprise, and she turned around and shoved him in the chest, causing him to stumble backwards. Then she stepped forward and decked him in the cheek.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My my, you like to play rough, don&rsquo;t ya?&rdquo; he taunted. &ldquo;Come over here, you!&rdquo; Carmine tried to attack her, and she did a round house kick on him. *Wham*</p></p>

<p><p>He was knocked against the table, and one of the bowls fell on his head, knocking him unconscious.</p></p>

<p><p>Now that Carmine is out of the way, Faith walked over to Fuchsia, who has no intentions of fighting. He showed his palms. &ldquo;No, wait. Hold on!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith wasted no time and punched him in the stomach. *Thud* Then she grabbed him by the collar and shoved him against the wall.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to fight! Have mercy on an old man.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was too angry to listen to his pleads. She tightened her grip in his collar. &ldquo;You call yourselves monks!? How dare you...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t my idea, honest! It was Carmine&rsquo;s doing.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You tricked me! How could you!&rdquo; she yelled. &ldquo;And to think I trusted you...do you monks have no shame? You&rsquo;re a disgrace to real monks everywhere!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> While she was yelling, Fuchsia was staring at her breasts. The towel covered most of them, but the cleavage was showing.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith noticed that Fuchsia&rsquo;s eyes were looking down in that direction, and she realized what he&rsquo;s staring at. Embarrassed, she backed away and covered her breasts with her hands.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You...pervert!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t staring on purpose. Honest!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Carmine woke up from his daze. He snuck up behind Faith while she was yelling at Fuchsia. When he was close enough, he pulled the towel off her body with one tug. *Whoosh* Once she realized she&rsquo;s naked, she screamed. Instinctively, she fell down to her knees and covered her private parts with her hands.</p></p>

<p><p>Fuchsia just saw a naked woman and he stood there like a deer in headlights. Carmine tossed the towel away. &ldquo;Heh, in the end you&rsquo;re just a woman.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Poor Faith could not move in her position, lest she should reveal herself to the monks.</p></p>

<p><p>Carmine stood behind her and grabbed her by the hair, pulling her head up. &ldquo;Uhhh!&rdquo; Faith winced from having her hair pulled.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now, where were we?&rdquo; he said into her ear.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;S-Stop...please.&rdquo; she mumbled, while opening one of her eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>Carmine looked at Fuchsia. &ldquo;Watch carefully, old man. This is how you savor a woman.&rdquo; One hand was pulling her hair, and he used his other hand to grab her chin and make her face him. He kissed her lips violently and tears drip down her eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>Then he shoved her on the floor, and got on top of her and did whatever he felt like. Even Fuchsia thinks that&rsquo;s going too far.</p></p>

<p><p>While she screamed in agony, Fuchsia got down on his knees, in front of a statue of Buddha and prayed for her.</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;W-What&rsquo;s he doing here?&rdquo; Faith asked fearfully. She hid behind Marianna.</p></p>

<p><p>The prince had the tip of his blade pointed at Carmine&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;This is the man that hurt you, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t kill me! Spare my life!&rdquo; Carmine pleaded.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna stepped to the side to stop shielding her friend. &ldquo;You have to watch this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo; Darian asked coldly.</p></p>

<p><p>Tears streamed down his eyes. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kill me! Please! I beg of you!&rdquo; He fell on his palms.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was watching without blinking. Carmine was the same man as before, yet he was different. Everything was different about him. He no longer had a menacing and perverted look on his face. He did not look like a demon...but rather a <strong>person</strong>. A helpless person crying and begging for his life.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna was watching Carmine but actually she was observing Faye&rsquo;s reaction.</p></p>

<p><p>The monk&rsquo;s begging continued. &ldquo;Please...show some mercy! don&rsquo;t kill me, I beg of you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>It was strange to see him crying and begging like this. It reminded her of herself when she was crying and begging when the monks violated her. He is the same as her. Actually no. He&rsquo;s worse. He&rsquo;s just a coward who values his own life too much. So this is what Darian wanted to show her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please have mercy! Don&rsquo;t kill me!&rdquo; Carmine has never been more scared in his life. Despite his fear, he was plotting something. He has a dagger hidden in his sleeve and he planned on using it as a surprise. He has a feeling that Darian will kill him no matter what, so he might as well try.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, his dagger came out of his sleeve and was hidden behind is palm. Marianna noticed it and had a reaction. Darian noticed her reaction. Carmine fell down on his back and threw the dagger and Darian dodged. The dagger hit his shoulder instead of his neck. Darian <strong>stabbed</strong> his sword into the monk&rsquo;s chest and made a twisting motion to make sure he&rsquo;s dead. Carmine coughed blood and uttered his last breath.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was shocked at what transpired. All that happened within seconds and the whole time she stood there like a deer in headlights.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna went to check on Darian&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo; he insisted.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith went over to him without thinking. &ldquo;Let me do something about this.&rdquo; She placed her hand over his shoulder and her hand glowed. Darian had no idea what she was doing so he just watched dumbfounded. His shoulder wound gradually disappeared until it was not there at all. In fact, all the injuries on his body vanished.</p></p>

<p><p>Then she went over and bent down to heal Marianna&rsquo;s leg. Within moments, her leg was healed. And just like that, Faith returned to her room.</p></p>

<p><p>Darian was confused. &ldquo;What just happened?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ever since she was a child, Faith had this hidden ability to heal others. Unfortunately, she can&rsquo;t control it. It happens spontaneously.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s amazing!&rdquo; exclaimed the prince. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing short of a miracle. She&rsquo;s still human right?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Of course. One hundred percent human. But just now she was able to activate her powers with her own will.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The door to her room was shut. Faith was lying in the same position as she always was, leaning against the wall and her head facing the window. Only this time, there were two differences. She actually fell asleep. Usually she was haunted by nightmares and stayed awake all the time. But she was tired and for the first time in a while, slept like a baby.</p></p>

<p><p>And secondly, the bowl of food was empty and so was the cup of water.</p></p>

<p><p>Not long afterwards, Faith exited the room of her own will for the first time. &ldquo;I have somewhere I want to go.&rdquo; she announced.</p></p>

<p><p>Mari and Darian were surprised yet happy at the same time. It looks like their friend is returning to normal. &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I want to go to the temple on Star Hill.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Star Hill?&rdquo; Darian repeated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard of it. Why there?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Because that&rsquo;s where I will find my mother.&rdquo;</p></p>
