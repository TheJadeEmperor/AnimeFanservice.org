<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="a">[ A ] - Mystery of the Healing Power. Origin of the Queen</span></p></center>

<p><p>The king and his daughter were having dinner at the dining table. The table was large enough to fit twenty people. Midas sat at the head while Faith sat to his right. All the food was placed near their corner, while most of the table remained unused. As expected, the food was top quality, made fresh from the ingredients from the best part of the animals. But tonight she was not interested in the food.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Father, I&rsquo;ve always wanted to know, what happened to my mother?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Midas stopped eating his food. &ldquo;What brought this up all of a sudden?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any memories of my mother. Last time I asked you, you said to wait until I&rsquo;m older. I want to know about her. And the origin of my healing abilities.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The king put down his fork on the plate. &ldquo;I suppose you are old enough...it&rsquo;s time you knew the truth.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith listened with all ears and without blinking even once.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s mother, the queen, was a priestess from a small town in the Almerak Kingdom. Named <strong>Emilia</strong> by birth, she spent her life helping other less fortunate people - the elderly, the children and the homeless. She was the very definition of a saint and motherly figure, admired by all and hated by none. But fate is twisted and cruel because she was carrying a terminal disease, one that cannot be cured by the technology of the time.</p></p>

<p><p>She left home with two other missionaries. They traveled to a larger town with a large poverty rate so they can volunteer.</p></p>

<p><p>One day, Emilia and her two missionaries were passing out rice to the villagers. All the villagers were grateful for their generosity and thanked them many times over. One particular townsfolk was an old man in beggar&rsquo;s clothes. After receiving the bag of rice, he bowed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Thank you my dear. You are truly a blessing from the heavens. You will be gifted with a long life.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Upon saying that, Emilia stared at the floor and the two missionaries glanced at each other.</p></p>

<p><p>The old man raised one eyebrow. &ldquo;Did I say something wrong?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo; replied the missionary.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; said Emilia. &ldquo;There is no need to deny the truth. The truth is I have a terminal disease. It is hereditary and we have searched for a cure but so far no doctor says there is a cure.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;An angel like you stricken with a deadly disease? Aye, fate is a cruel. But alas, don&rsquo;t lose hope. Have you heard of Star Hill?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Emilia and the two young men glanced at each other. &ldquo;Star Hill?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aye. It is known as the highest mountain any man is able to live on. At the top of that mountain is a temple. The monks who have lived there have no worldly desires and live a life of celibacy and peace. They pray in the bath water every day. The water has absorbed their pure energy for thousands of years. It is said that the water can heal any injury or disease.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Is this true?&rdquo; asked Emilia.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It is merely a rumor. But it is something you may want to look into. You&rsquo;re going to die anyways, might as well check it out right? Hohoho.&rdquo; The old man started to walk away.</p></p>

<p><p>The first missionary said: &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Emilia and her two companions have a renewed sense of hope - light was seen in her eyes for the first time. They were skeptical but at least they have hope.</p></p>

<p><p>Their hope kept them going for a while. They went from village to village, doing volunteer service while asking for any clues about Star Hill. At long last, they have found its location thanks to a traveling monk. Time is of the essence so they went there immediately. It turns out the temple was located at the top of the mountain; that is why it is called Star Hill, it is the hill that reaches the stars. The only way there is to walk up the impossibly long flight of stairs starting at the base of the mountain.</p></p>

<p><p>Emilia and her two missionaries reached the mountain&rsquo;s base by horse. They were weary of traveling, and upon seeing the endless stairs, they sighed. Emilia hopped off her horse. &ldquo;I can take it from here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But my lady...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I can manage by myself. Star Hill is just up these stairs. Thank you for all you&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>As she requested, her two companions leave her alone to walk the stairs herself. She was tired from her journey and it took her several hours to walk up the stairs. When she finally reached the top she saw an old, run down temple. No one has maintained it for hundreds of years. This set her expectations for what&rsquo;s inside. Emilia pushed the doors open, making a creaking sound. She stepped inside a big empty room. &ldquo;Hello? Anyone here?&rdquo; There was no reply, so she thought the temple must be empty. There was a life-sized buddha statue at the wall, amongst various other artifacts disperse throughout the room. She walked slowly, admiring her surroundings, her eyes studied every detail of this legendary temple.</p></p>

<p><p>Just now, the doors opened and old monk appeared. &ldquo;Oya oya...I haven&rsquo;t had guests in a long time. To whom I have the pleasure of speaking with?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Emilia bowed. &ldquo;Greetings abbot. I am called Emilia. I have traveled a long way to come here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The abbot bowed. &ldquo;I am called <strong>Thulian</strong>. It is a pleasure to meet you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The pleasure is mine.&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Are there others who live here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not, my lady. All the monks who lived here died many years ago. We monks do not have children and we don&rsquo;t get new members. I am the only one remaining. I alone look after this temple.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been living here by yourself all this time? Wow. It must get lonely here?&rdquo; Emilia asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m used to it.&rdquo; replied the abbot.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Is it true that the sacred water can heal anything?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ah, of course. You came here for the sacred water. Let me bring you to the bath house.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Thulian took her to the bath house where there was a large pool of water. He stepped into the water in a loincloth as Emilia watched. He stayed in the middle of the pool and put his palms together and started praying. His chanting was incompressible but the effects can be seen by the naked eye. His body created ripples and he began to glow.</p></p>

<p><p>Emilia was awed by the sight. So the legend is true after all. She can finally be at ease knowing that she will conquer her terminal disease.</p></p>

<p><p>Thulian left her alone so she can bath in the sacred water. She disrobed and dipped her toes. The water was chilly but not too cold. She dipped her whole body into the water. She splashed water on her face and it was refreshing. She drank the water. It was cold and tasted like regular water. But she felt her body being healed just by being here for a few minutes. Then she sank into the water little by little, until her head was completely submerged.</p></p>

<p><p>Inside the water, she was curled up in fetal position with her eyes closed. Bubbles from her mouth went to the surface.</p></p>

<p><p>she felt her whole body change, can&rsquo;t explain it</p></p>

<p><p>Several days have passed since Emilia started living in the temple, and every day she would bathe in the sacred water. Although she felt refreshed every time, there was no change physically. That is, until one day Thulian had an accident in the woods. He told her he would go outside to collect some wood for the fire, but he did not come back for a while. Emilia went outside to search for him, and heard him crying out.</p></p>

<p><p>Thulian was on the ground, his ankle was <strong>bleeding</strong>. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; asked Emilia.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too clumsy in my old age. My leg got caught by a branch from the soil.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let me see.&rdquo; Emilia&rsquo;s hands hovered over the wound, thinking she could heal it. She has never done this before, but her gut reaction says she can do it. Her hands glowed and her ki sprinkled over Thulian&rsquo;s ankle. Both of them were shocked, especially the abbot, who raised his eyebrows all the way. Within a minute, his wound closed up completely.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You did it...but how?&rdquo; asked the abbot.</p></p>

<p><p>Emilia stared at her own palms in disbelief. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. That&rsquo;s the first time I ever did that, but for some reason I felt like I could.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the sacred water. It has changed your body. It&rsquo;s a miracle!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t that mean you have the same ability?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I have been bathing in the sacred water my whole life, but it has no effect on me, unfortunately. It does not work on everyone, and we don&rsquo;t know why. But it is working wonders on you. You are the chosen one, the creator of miracles.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Chosen one?&rdquo; Emilia asked, smiling. &ldquo;There has to be a better explanation for this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>After discovering her newfound powers, Emilia decided it is best if she uses it to help people. A village near the temple was struck with poverty and many people often lie on the streets, unable to afford a doctor. A certain man had bandages on his arm as he was bitten by a demon. Emilia walked over to him and began to heal him in the same fashion as before &ndash; she hovered her palms over the wound and transferred her energy to him.</p></p>

<p><p>A man in a hood and robe walked by and happened to see this miracle. He was <strong>Prince Midas</strong>, the crown prince of the kingdom. His eyes grew wide open as he witnessed Emilia made the man&rsquo;s wound disappear before his very eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>The wounded man thanked her over and over. Prince Midas walked over to them. &ldquo;I cannot believe I witnessed such a miracle. Who are you, young lady?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Emilia saw Midas and she was immediately drawn to him. His clothes were that of a traveler, but there was an elegance to him that suggests he is more than meets the eye. She has no idea that he is royalty, soon to be the king of the entire kingdom, but she can sense it from him. &ldquo;I am Emilia, a priestess from a small town.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Upon first sight, the two were drawn to each other like moths to a flame. It is not an exaggeration to say that it was love at first sight. Prince Midas was pretending to be a commoner because he wanted to explore the towns before he became the king. Once he becomes coroneted, he will not get a chance to travel like he is doing now. They started to spend time together and they got along well, so well that the time they spent together was smooth and it felt like time flew by. Despite him being the crown prince, his status did not matter to either of them.</p></p>

<p><p>Only a month later, Midas <strong>proposed</strong> to her...and she said yes. The sun was setting in the background and they stood at the edge of a cliff. It was the best proposal anyone could ask for. They hugged and kissed in the evening sky.</p></p>

<p><p>After accepting the proposal, Emilia said goodbye to the abbot in the temple and set off to start her new life. The next few years were dream like, as she lived in the imperial palace with Prince Midas. She served as a doctor to dukes and other nobles and many dubbed her the miracle priestess.</p></p>

<p><p>Unfortunately, their dream life did not last. One day, Emilia fainted and a doctor examined her. Her disease was still active, the sacred water did not heal her at all. She can heal others but she cannot heal herself...it&rsquo;s an ironic power she gained.</p></p>

<p><p>Midas kneeled on the bed and took her hands. &ldquo;I swear I will find a cure for you. I will summon the best doctors in the land. If I have to I will even resort to using doctors who use black magic, whatever it takes!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Emilia nodded and smiled. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s find a cure together.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A year later, she gave birth to a son, they named him Acelot. About a year later, she gave birth to a daughter named Faith. During this time, Midas sought the best doctors and had them examined his wife, but to no avail. Shortly afterwards, Emilia passed away. The children were too young to understand death, but Midas was devastated and he did not handle her death well. He started to drink heavily and eat like a glutton. Not only did his health suffer, but he neglected his children.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith exited her room and the door slammed open. Mari and Darian were surprised she left the room on her own will. Their friend&rsquo;s demeanor and body language was different - she was no longer the defeated, sad woman she was before. &ldquo;I have somewhere I want to go.&rdquo; she announced.</p></p>

<p><p>Mari and Darian were surprised yet happy at the same time. It looks like their friend is returning to normal. &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I want to go to the temple on Star Hill.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Star Hill?&rdquo; Darian repeated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard of it. Why there?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Because that&rsquo;s where I will find my mother.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Your mother?&rdquo; asked Marianna. &ldquo;The queen? But didn&rsquo;t she pass away a long time ago?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;She used to live in a temple on the top of Star Hill. I want to see the temple that my mother lived in.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Fuchsia and the other monks were cleaning up the mess from the fight the previous day. Magenta, Maroon and Cerise were injured but still had to work, like mopping the floor and repairing doors. They stopped when an announced visitor arrived. &ldquo;What a mess.&rdquo; said Ren.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sir Ren?&rdquo; said Fuchsia. &ldquo;What brings you here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to remind you of our deal.&rdquo; said Ren.</p></p>

<p><p>The monks had a flashback of Ren&rsquo;s first visit to their temple. When he arrived, the monks had a look of mistrust on their faces. The one who spoke to him was Fuchsia. &ldquo;You are Rubeu&rsquo;s representative?&rdquo; asked Fuchsia.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The name&rsquo;s Ren, that&rsquo;s all you need to know. My master has a proposal for you. Soon two women and one man will visit this temple. Your job is to separate them. You will hold the woman named Faith here as a hostage and wait for further instructions. Here is an advance payment.&rdquo; He tossed a bag of cold on the floor. *Clunk*</p></p>

<p><p>The monks&rsquo; eyes glittered with greed. Magenta and Maroon kneeled down and grabbed the coins, letting it slip through their hands and drop on the floor. &ldquo;This is a lot of money!&rdquo; exclaimed. Magenta.</p></p>

<p><p>(These guys are so greedy that they&rsquo;re easy to read.) thought Ren. (It&rsquo;s hilarious that they consider themselves monks.)</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You have failed. And my master is not happy about this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But Sir Ren,&rdquo; said Fuchsia. &ldquo;Marianna and Darian came back to attack us. You said you&rsquo;d take care of them!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ren raised his cap a little bit. &ldquo;Those two are alive? Tch, damn it. That&rsquo;s still no excuse for letting the princess escape.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Princess?&rdquo; Maroon repeated. &ldquo;Who are you talking about?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me...the woman we captured is the Princess of Almerak?&rdquo; asked Cerise. &ldquo;We had no idea she was that important. Had you told us-&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter! Your job was to keep her hostage. Now go and capture the princess or Rubeus will have your heads!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>All the monks trembled with fear. &ldquo;Do not worry, we will find her.&rdquo; said Fuchsia.</p></p>

<p><p>Darian put his sword shell inside his belt. &ldquo;Where will you go?&rdquo; asked Marianna.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I am going to find the monks. They work for Rubeus so I can get a clue to their whereabouts. After I get the information I need from them, I will finish them off.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Do you think they are still at the temple?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t be if they&rsquo;re smart. What will you do?&rdquo; Darian asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to follow Faith to Star Hill. I&rsquo;m still worried about her.&rdquo; Marianna said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Very well then. Let us meet again soon and continue our adventure.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Definitely.&rdquo; Marianna replied.</p></p>

<p><p>Without wasting any more time, Marianna set off to follow her best friend&rsquo;s trail. Faith was riding a horse so she followed the footprints of the horse. Fortunately, she did not get that far. She was taking a break by the lake. The horse sipped water while Faith was petting her. After the break was over, Faith hopped on the horse and they galloped away. Marianna followed her in the trees while staying hidden. Like a ninja, she jumped from tree to tree while staying as silent as possible.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith did not take any more breaks and traveled non-stop for half a day. She was excited to see the temple that her mother lived in. Marianna did not have a horse and she was exhausted after hours of trailing her friend.</p></p>

<p><p>The Sacred Temple is located on the top of a hill, according to rumors of the nearest town. But to get to the top of it, one needs to climb up a long staircase starting at the very bottom. As soon as she saw the staircase, Faith got off her horse. She petted it. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re free now.&rdquo; The horse whined as if it understood her words, but it remained in place.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith looked up at the endless stairs but she was not phased at its size. She was more focused on getting to the temple, because that is where everything began. After taking a deep breath, she took the first step and from there, her feet took her upwards.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna appeared and stood in front of the stairs, standing at the very spot Faith was just five minutes ago. By now she should be halfway up the hill. Following her friend has made her tired, so she sat down, putting her chin in her palms. Marianna sighed as she waited. She has no intentions of going into the temple, as this is her friend&rsquo;s journey, and she did not want to disturb her.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith entered pushing through the front door, which made a creaking sound. Creeeek. &ldquo;Hello? Is anyone here?&rdquo; she shouted. Her voice echoed throughout the big room. It was full of dust and spider webs and showed not a sign of life. She checked every room in the temple and found no one, and concluded that the monk who lived here died already.</p></p>

<p><p>There was a portrait of a monk on the wall with his name labeled on the frame. Faith put her palms together in praying pose. &ldquo;Rest in peace Abbot Thulian. Forgive the intrusion but I&rsquo;m going to use this temple for now.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>One particular room in the temple was unlike the others, it looked like a cave. There was a pool full of sacred water. Faith approached the bath slowly and bent down in front of it. She splashed her face with the water. It felt really refreshing and noticed this was different than normal water. Rumor has it that the sacred water can heal literally anything.</p></p>

<p><p>She grew curious and decided to test it out. She took off her clothes and hopped into the pool and sat down. The water felt cold but a tolerable kind of cold. She poured water on her face. She can feel the water healing her body as well as her mind and spirit. This is exactly what she needed, after having her spirit broken.</p></p>

<p><p>So this is the pool where her mother bathed in many years ago? Faith never met her so this pool of water is the only connection she has to her mother. She dove her entire body into the water and curled up into a fetal position...the bubbles from her mouth reaching the surface.</p></p>

<p><p>She remained in fetal position with her eyes shut for the rest of the bath. Her face was buried between her knees. This sacred water is the only thing that can make her body clean again. She wanted to stay submerged for as long as humanly possible because she was desperate to get rid of the filth on her body. But even if her body is clean her mind was still haunted by those memories.</p></p>

<p><p>Without her towel, Faith had nothing to cover herself with except her hands. One hand was on her breasts and the other hand was between her legs. The three monks were leering at her with lustful eyes and perverted grins on their faces. Their eyes were lustful the moment they saw her in a towel. But now that she&rsquo;s naked, their eyes became completely full of lust and evil.</p></p>

<p><p>This is the worst possible situation for Faith&#8230;She was naked, and on her knees, and trapped against the wall. At this point escape is no longer possible...even defending herself was not possible she was a lamb about to be slaughtered.</p></p>

<p><p>They continue making remarks. &ldquo;So, she&rsquo;s just a regular woman after all.&rdquo; said Maroon.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...no...please!&rdquo; Faith cried out.</p></p>

<p><p>But her cries were in vain. It was clear what they wanted from the beginning...to strip her of everything and do unspeakably horrible things to her body. And now they were about to get what they want. The monks stared at her naked body like a wolf stare at its prey.</p></p>

<p><p>Magenta smiled wickedly. &ldquo;She sure gave us a scare back there.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s kinda cute when she screams like that.&rdquo; said Maroon.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s entire body trembled from fear and suspense. To be completely naked in front of these horny men is a situation that&rsquo;s beyond her <strong>nightmares</strong>...this is a scenario straight from <strong>hell</strong>. She feared for her life...what is going to happen next? But instinctively, she knows what is going to happen. Tears dripped from her shaking eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ohhh yes...I like that look.&rdquo; said Cerise. &ldquo;Submissive women are my type.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Especially if they&rsquo;re naked! Hahahaha.&rdquo; said Magenta.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now, why don&rsquo;t we have some fun with her&#8230;&rdquo; said Maroon.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...no...please!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>In her point of view the monks seem like giants...they kept growing while she kept shrinking. They approached her and their hands reached for her...while their laughter echoed in the background.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please no!!!&rdquo; More tears dripped down her cheek.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha!&rdquo; One of their hands came closer and closer to her face.</p></p>

<p><p>In her eyeball, one could see the reflection of Maroon&rsquo;s hand coming closer and closer...</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No! No! AAAAHHHHHH!&rdquo; Faith&rsquo;s screams echoed throughout the temple.</p></p>

<p><p>As that image haunted her mind, she clenched her legs even tighter against herself. She was clearly in pain and anguish as her head turned left and right. She was reminded of Cerise&rsquo;s words.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming for me, I know it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;They abandoned you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith shook her head. &ldquo;No! That&rsquo;s not true. They&rsquo;re coming for me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah? Why didn&rsquo;t they save you when we had our way with you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s eyes opened wide.</p></p>

<p><p><strong>Faith was in a towel running in complete darkness. In the sky were images of Marianna and Darian&rsquo;s face. She was chasing their image, her arm reaching for them and screaming their name. But they didn&rsquo;t see her or hear her voice. The monks were directly behind her, chasing her and they were catching up. But they did not take the form of humans, but rather demons with claws. Their bodies were black and their limbs were twisted like that of a tree. They had the faces of Cerise, Maroon and Magenta, except much more uglier and sinister. They don&rsquo;t have eyeballs and they had sinister smiles across their faces. </strong></p></p>

<p><p><strong> &ldquo;Marianna!&rdquo; she cried out. &ldquo;Help! Marianna!&rdquo; </strong></p></p>

<p><p><strong> The demons&rsquo; laughter echoed in the darkness. They caught up to her and one of their tentacles grabbed her arm. Another claw grabbed her shoulder and another one got her right arm. They pulled her towel off and she continued to run while naked. But she did not get far...their claws caught her feet. </strong></p></p>

<p><p><strong> She was unable to run further and their claws snatched her arms and shoulders. </strong></p></p>

<p><p><strong> &ldquo;Marianna! Darian!&rdquo; she cried out in vain. </strong></p></p>

<p><p>The three monks have her surrounded, she was against the wall, and that means escape is impossible. She was naked and helpless, kneeling on the ground, her arms covering her private parts. Their devilish laughter echoed through the room, their leering eyes were glowing red, piercing the darkness. These monks were not men, they were more like beasts...or rather, demons.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now, why don&rsquo;t we have some fun&#8230;&rdquo; Maroon&rsquo;s hand reached for her.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s eyes were shaking in fear and tears dripped from her eyes. &ldquo;No&#8230;please!&rdquo; She was directly in front of the wall, so she was completely trapped.</p></p>

<p><p>Maroon bent down to her level and his hand grabbed her hair. Tears drip down her face as she stared at him frightfully. &ldquo;Stop...please....&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Maroon forced his lips into hers, and the tears streamed down her face like a river. For this man to kiss her like this, it has to be the single worst moment of her life...yet it&rsquo;s only the beginning of the end.</p></p>

<p><p>Maroon was pulling her hair and yanking her head up and down. She was moaning and groaning like a helpless animal. Then he violently shoved her head to the side, making her fall down sideways. *Splat*</p></p>

<p><p>Faith turned herself over so that she&rsquo;s facing them...one hand instinctively covered her breasts while the other covered her vital spot. While like this, she was unable to move.</p></p>

<p><p>The three monks walked over to her and leered at her exposed body with lust and perversion in their eyes. They laughed and sneered at her. Hahahahaha!</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...please!&rdquo; Faith&rsquo;s body was trembling and her eyes were shaking.</p></p>

<p><p>All of their hands reached for her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...please!! Noooooooo!!!&rdquo; She has never been this afraid in her life. She was butt naked and these monks kept laughing.</p></p>

<p><p>Their demonic faces faded and blended into the darkness, leaving behind only their deep red eyes and their hands.</p></p>

<p><p>All she could do was scream in terror...as their hands were about to reach her. &ldquo;AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p><strong> The demon&rsquo;s dark tentacles surrounded Faith&rsquo;s naked body and began to devour her. Their laughter echoed in the background. The monk&rsquo;s heads twisted and turned as they continue to make their lewd remarks. </strong></p></p>

<p><p><strong> &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, be our woman.&rdquo; said Magenta.</strong></p></p>

<p><p><strong> &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just a bunch of lonely old men.&rdquo; said Maroon. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t had a woman in ages.&rdquo;</strong></p></p>

<p><p><strong> Faith was screaming and moaning the whole time. &ldquo;No, please, stop!&rdquo; </strong></p></p>

<p><p><strong> One tentacle wrapped itself around her right shoulder, making circles around her arm, reached her elbow, and eventually reached her hand.</strong></p></p>

<p><p><strong> &ldquo;Help me...Squire...father...anyone...&rdquo;</strong></p></p>

<p><p><strong> Tentacles have wrapped themselves around her legs. By now, most of her body was covered by the dark tentacles. </strong></p></p>

<p><p><strong> The Magenta head bit her on the shoulder. *Schleb* She shrieked. </strong></p></p>

<p><p><strong> The Maroon head bit the side of her stomach. *Schleb* She shrieked. &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; The Cerise head bit her thigh. &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</strong></p></p>

<p><p><strong> The demon heads&rsquo; laughter echoed in the darkness and her body was slowly surrounded by the darkness...</strong></p></p>

<p><p>The woman&rsquo;s screams echoed in the dark temple. &ldquo;No please! Please no!&rdquo; Faith cried out. Cerise had her pinned down from the right side while Maroon secured her right side. Cerise secured her wrist with one hand while the other hand held her leg in place, keeping her knee bent. Maroon secured her wrist and had his knee on her stomach. Magenta was holding onto her ankles to keep her legs in place.</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise squeezed her left breast. &ldquo;Her breasts are so round and firm.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Maroon squeezed the other one. &ldquo;Her nipples are so pink and hard.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith moaned from their touching. She kept pleading to stop over and over.</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise put his face into her breasts and munched on them. Maroon was horny and impatient. He shoved Cerise out of the way. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my turn!&rdquo; He dipped his face into her breasts.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s head tossed and turned and she moaned like hell.</p></p>

<p><p><strong> The tentacle that tied up her right arm turned into a demon head with Magenta&rsquo;s face. His tongue was sticking out as he stared at he in a lewd way. She was gasping in fear and she winced as he drew closer. He licked her cheek and she winced with tears dripping down her eyes. </strong></p></p>

<p><p><strong> Then the Magenta head looked down. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s over here?&rdquo; The head stuck itself between her breasts. She glanced down and saw the demon head down there. Most of his face was obscured by her breasts. He looked up at her and smiled wickedly. It was a weird and disgusting sight to behold. Not only was he violating her but he was smiling at her. </strong></p></p>

<p><p><strong> The Maroon head was licking her back, enjoying himself to the fullest. </strong></p></p>

<p><p><strong> The Cerise head wrapped itself around her legs. It licked her legs. &ldquo;I wonder what&rsquo;s down here? Hehe.&rdquo; The head went to her private parts and started eating it.</strong></p></p>

<p><p><strong> Faith groaned as she was violated everywhere at once. &ldquo;Uhhh! Uhhh!&rdquo; </strong></p></p>

<p><p><strong> Her arms were tied to her hips and her body was completely surrounded by the black tentacles. </strong></p></p>

<p><p><strong> The demons laughed non-stop as they devoured her body. </strong></p></p>

<p><p>The images were too painful to bear and she put her hands on her head and screamed inside the water. *Splash* Her head appeared atop the water and panted for breath. Water was dripping down her hair and facial features. Taking a bath was not as relaxing as she thought it would be so she decided to get out of the pool.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna sighed and then saw a man in the distance and became curious as to who it was. As he came closer, she recognized him by his black clothes, it was Prince Darian. She did not get up to greet him, but just waited until he came to her. &ldquo;Yo.&rdquo; she said casually.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you inside the temple?&rdquo; he asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My job was to follow Faith here, not go inside with her. The temple holds meaning for her but not for me. Why are you here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I lost track of the monks. They&rsquo;re slippery like snakes.&rdquo; Darian replied.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Our princess has found her place. So, what now?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Darian said, pounding his own palm. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we visit Sunrise Village again?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna&rsquo;s face lit up. &ldquo;Yeah! That sounds like a plan. I want to see Tanae again.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith came into the bathroom to take a bath again. She walked into the pool standing up and then sat down. Her clothes were folded neatly nearby. The water somehow felt medicinal, healing her body, mind and soul. Not only that, but she can sense traces of her mother in the water.</p></p>

<p><p>She extended her arm and washed it with water. *Sploosh* She washed it from the hand up to her shoulder, letting the water drip back into the pool.</p></p>

<p><p>When she was done, she stepped out of the pool and wrapped a pink towel around her torso, and used another towel to dry her hair. Suddenly, she heard footsteps coming her way. &ldquo;Marianna?&rdquo; she asked.</p></p>

<p><p>To her dismay, it was Cerise, Carmine and Maroon standing before her. Her eyes grew wide open and her jaw dropped open, and her legs grew weak. The small towel in her hand dropped. *Plop*</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise leered at her from the toes to her head. &ldquo;Well well what a surprise. If it isn&rsquo;t you, the woman from before.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Did we catch you at a bad time?&rdquo; said Carmine.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh heh heh. Were you taking a bath?&rdquo; said Maroon. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s about we wash your back for you? Heh heh heh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...no...stay away!&rdquo; Faith said while stepping back.</p></p>

<p><p>The three monks approached her slowly while making grabbing gestures.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...don&rsquo;t come closer! No!&rdquo; She tripped on a rock and fell backwards. &ldquo;Ugh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let me scrub those legs of yours. Hya hya hya.&rdquo; said Cerise.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith crawled back while shrieking. On her right was the wall and Cerise and Magenta were in front of her, while Cerise were on her left. She was surrounded with no where to go. &ldquo;No...don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ll make you squeaky clean.&rdquo; said Carmine. &ldquo;All over your body.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;TheSpongeBath&quot;></a></p></p>

<p><p>Their shadows covered the wall as they approached her inch by inch. In her perception, their perverted grins became twisted and their eyes glowed white. Their hands became like claws. &ldquo;No...no! Aaaaaaaaaah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="c">[ C ] - The Place of Healing. Mystery of Star Hill</span></p></center>


<p><p>*Drip drop* A drop of water hit the concrete floor next to the fallen woman. That was only audible sound heard in the silent room. Faith was laying on the concrete butt naked. She was face flat, staring sideways at the wall, her arms were spread out diagonally, palms facing up.</p></p>

<p><p>Carmine was done with her and left her in this dark and damp room, and she has been here for an undermined amount of time.</p></p>

<p><p>She was naked, exhausted and unable to move an inch. She tried to escape but it was all pointless. She ended up being back here - in the same place in the same position.</p></p>

<p><p>A teardrop escaped the corner of her eye. She no longer had the will to move...and remained motionless.</p></p>

<p><p>The wooden door opened. *Creeek* Cerise came in, carrying a bucket of water with him. Once inside, he shut the door behind him, and proceeded to walk towards the fallen woman. He was wearing nothing but a loincloth. He placed the bucket down and took out a sponge from the bucket.</p></p>

<p><p>He could no wait to get started on giving her a sponge bath, it was clear based on the look of glee on his face. &ldquo;How are you, darling? It&rsquo;s time for your sponge bath.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He put some soap on the sponge, then he squeezed the sponge by twisting it, forcing the water to pour in the bucket. He began by placing the sponge on her calf and glided it up to her thigh. He did it slowly and carefully, making sure every inch of her skin was covered in soap. He was enjoying this very much.</p></p>

<p><p>Even though he wasn&rsquo;t touching her directly, his eyes got a treat. He moved the sponge up to her butt cheek. He moved it in a circular motion to make sure to get her entire cheek.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make sure you&rsquo;re clean...<strong>squeaky clean</strong>.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise moved the sponge to her other butt cheek and repeated the same actions. After he was sure to get every inch, he moved it down to her right thigh. Then he raised her leg by the knee to wash her calf.</p></p>

<p><p>Then he placed the sponge on her lower back and glided it from left to right.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is the life, isn&rsquo;t it? I want to give you a sponge bath every single day.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>His hand made its way to her upper back, making sure every inch was clean. After all, her body is now property that belongs to him. So he has to make sure she&rsquo;s clean so he can sexually violate her again. He brushed her pony tail out of the way and continued to wash her back.</p></p>

<p><p>He lightly touched her cheek with the sponge. He glided the sponge on the edge of her shoulder and moved it up and down. He proceeded to wash her other shoulder.</p></p>

<p><p>Her back side was complete, so now it&rsquo;s time to wash her front. He flipped her over to expose her front side. She still did not move a muscle, but rather just let him do what he wants. He stuck the sponge on her face, she turned her head to the side to stare at the wall. The poor girl had no life left in her and just endured the continued humiliation.</p></p>

<p><p>He washed her chin and her neck and the front of her shoulders. Then he raised her right arm and placed the sponge on her wrist and scrubbed his way down to her shoulder. He scrubbed up and down. Sounds of the scrubbing and soap can be heard. He also washed the underarm as well. When he was done with the right arm, he proceeded to repeat the actions with her left arm.</p></p>

<p><p>He went over to the other side of her body and raised her left arm. Her head turned to the opposite side to avoid looking at him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you lucky?&rdquo; said Cerise. &ldquo;To have someone give you a bath like this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s face showed no reaction, but who knows what she really felt on the inside. It was certain that his words repulsed her. To be in a situation like this is the worst situation any woman can ever be in. It is a true nightmare. But according to Cerise&rsquo;s twisted logic, she is lucky. The truly lucky one is Cerise, who gets a thrill out of this.</p></p>

<p><p>He moved the sponge down to her breasts. He squished it into the valley between the breasts, sliding it up and down. He also washed her breasts with circular motions, making sure to get every inch. One hand washed her right breast, while his other hand squeezed the other breast. He was cleaning her and violating her at the same time.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is the life, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>There are several stages she goes through before getting to this point. At first, Faith fights back. She is a trained fighter and swordsman who has been training since the age of ten. Despite her feminine nature, she is a fighter at heart.</p></p>

<p><p>When the three monks tried to violate her in the bathhouse, she fought back. Despite being embarrassed, towel clad and having her skin exposed, she fought to the bitter end. But there are times when she cannot fight back...as what happened before. When she lost her towel and she kneeled naked in front of the monks.</p></p>

<p><p>If she cannot fight back, she will plead for mercy - just as what any helpless woman would do. She will plead and scream until her throat dries up and her lungs give up. But after that stage is when she completely gives up - this is the current stage she is in.</p></p>

<p><p>In this condition, she does not even put up a resistance or even beg. She just endures whatever happens to her, hoping the assault will stop eventually.</p></p>

<p><p>When he was done playing with her breasts, he proceeded to wash her stomach. He stayed in the belly button for a few seconds. Then he inched the sponge down to his favorite body part...this is the part he&rsquo;s been looking forward to for a few minutes. He patiently washed her upper body and now...it&rsquo;s time for him to indulge...</p></p>

<p><p>He glided the sponge onto her lady parts and brushed it up and down. Then he squished the sponge against her lady parts, resulting in soap oozing out of the sponge. Cerise&rsquo;s face was like a vile villain, and at the same time, child like as he was excited.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s face showed some reaction to it...her eyes twitched a little bit. Her lips parted further as she breathed hard. Her fingers twitched a little...and her toes curled.</p></p>

<p><p>He kept pushing the sponge against it, causing her much discomfort. That&rsquo;s a woman&rsquo;s most sensitive area and it must be washed gently. And he&rsquo;s treating it like his toy.</p></p>

<p><p>Despite her bodily reactions, Faith was unable to offer any resistance. In her mind, she had to endure this...no matter how painful and humiliating this was. Eventually he&rsquo;ll be done and will leave her alone.</p></p>

<p><p>When Cerise was finally done playing with her private parts, he moved the sponge towards her inner thigh and began to wash that area.</p></p>

<p><p>Then he grabbed her calf and raised her leg against his chest. He scrubbed her ankle and shin. He was staring at her shin with a perverted and greedy look in his face, like he would money or gold.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Your skin is so soft and smooth. You&rsquo;ve been taking care of yourself...and now your body belongs to me only.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise moved the sponge to her feet and scrubbed it thoroughly. When he was done with her feet, he put down this leg and proceeded to wash the other leg.</p></p>

<p><p>He was done washing every inch of her body. He dropped the sponge near her hip and walked towards the bucket of water. He poured the water on her body. *Splash* It was cold. Some of the water hit her face.</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise proceeded to kneel on top of her hips. She was still looking sideways with the same expression the whole time. &ldquo;How about we take a bath together? I&rsquo;ll wash you with my own body.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Despite being in a state of shock, Faith heard and understood every word he whispered to her. She made no movements but it clearly showed in her eyes how creeped out she was.</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise lay on top of her flat and began to rub his body against hers. He had just bathed her so her body was slippery - so he slid up and down as if he&rsquo;s a washboard.</p></p>

<p><p>This became extremely uncomfortable for the poor girl. Not only was a man&rsquo;s body on top of hers, but he was sliding up and down, causing more discomfort. He was wearing just a loin cloth while she was butt naked and unfortunately they felt each other&rsquo;s skin. She could feel his stomach grind against hers, his chest rubbing against her breasts, as well as his legs rubbing against hers. The monk was panting for breath as he enjoyed himself, and she could feel his breathing on her face.</p></p>

<p><p>She had planned to silently endure the sponge bath and all the torture that he would do to her, but it was becoming increasingly difficult to endure this. Her pain and suffering before was nothing compared to what it is right now. Not only did she have to endure the humiliation of being given a naked sponge bath, but now... Cerise was violating nearly every part of her womanly body.</p></p>

<p><p>She felt everything being down to her - his skin rubbing against her skin, his breath on her face, and worse of all, he was rubbing his genitals against her lady spot. Her fingers twitched a little bit, her eyes squinted and opened wider, and her lips parted slightly.</p></p>

<p><p>Her right arm moved a few inches towards her side and happen to touch the sponge. She instinctively grabbed onto it and began to squeeze it. But her grip was so weak that it could barely be considered a squeeze.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s eyes grew wet and she was on the verge of tears. Cerise was enjoying this a lot. This was too much for her to bear. Every time he stroked her, her grip on the sponge tightened, squeezing water out. She remained silent this whole time until now...she let out quiet moans. The room was silent so her noises were audible.</p></p>

<p><p>Eventually the monk grew bored of this and stopped. Faith&rsquo;s squeeze on the sponge loosened and she can take a breath of relief.</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise put his face next to her cheek and whispered: &ldquo;And now...I&rsquo;m going to give you a bath with my tongue. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She tried her best to endure the torture...but this was becoming too much. Not only were his words disgusting, but his breath was nasty as well. She could feel his rotten breath on her cheek and ear.</p></p>

<p><p>Even worse, right after he said that, he kissed her on the cheek. His touches sent chills down her spine. Her eyes twitched a little bit.</p></p>

<p><p>The monk started his assault on her neckline - he kissed it with open mouth kisses and moved down towards her cleavage. After kissing her cleavage all over, he proceeded to violate her breasts with his mouth and hands. His hands squeezed her breasts firmly while he sucked on her nipples. Every few seconds or so he would switch to the other breast. After sucking, he started licking them.</p></p>

<p><p>Her fingers tightened their grip on the sponge, squeezing out a little bit of water. To be able to suck on a young woman&rsquo;s breast like this is every man&rsquo;s wet dream. Her breasts tastes good, especially after bathing her. She was fresh and ripe for the picking. He could have stayed here all day, but eventually he grew bored. He moved his face higher towards her neck and began licking her neck.</p></p>

<p><p>Her face was sideways the whole time, revealing her left cheek. He licked her cheek, gliding his tongue from the jaw to nearly the eye. Faith winced from digest, shutting her eyes completely. Her grip on the sponge became tighter, oozing out drops of water.</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise went back to kissing her neck. Faith&rsquo;s head turned to the right to avoid him. Her grip on the sponge loosened. He kissed her neck and her head titled upwards. His lips made their way to her chin, and finally, their ultimate destination, her lips.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mmmmmmmfffff!&rdquo; Faith squeezed the sponge hard and a lot of water came out.</p></p>

<p><p>He sucked on her lips like a kid would a lollipop. It tasted sweet and soft and wet. Tears stream down her eyes as her hand squeezed the sponge hard. Her toes curled.</p></p>

<p><p>The lip lock was only a few seconds, but for her, it felt like hours. When he was done, he lifted his head up to look at her face. Tears were on her cheek. Her expression had changed from before - her eyes looked sad. He liked that look.</p></p>

<p><p>Then Cerise moved down to her neck, and back to her breasts and continued to suck on them.</p></p>

<p><p>The poor girl could not move at all, except for squeezing the sponge in her hand, and the occasional turn of the head.</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise moved his face towards her stomach. Making kisses on her stomach. Then he licked her belly button.</p></p>

<p><p>Cerise moved his face down to her lady parts and began munching on it.</p></p>

<p><p>She squeezed the sponge hard, and more water came out. Tears stream down her eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>When he was done with that, he kneeled on top of her legs. He stuck his hand into her lady parts.</p></p>

<p><p>She squeezed the sponge harder, nearly all the water was out. The sponge was dried up - just like her life.</p></p>

<p><p>Fresh tears stream down her face. He kept squished his hand in there, he snickered with a perverted face. She let out a quiet moan.</p></p>

<p><p>By now, the sponge was dried up and only small drops of water came out.</p></p>

<p><p>He lay down on her, putting his legs on top of hers, and his face into her breasts. He continued his assault. She squeezed the sponge but there was no water left, not even a drop.</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="d">[ D ] - The Eye Opener...Village in Ashes</span></p></center>


<p><p>After much traveling, Marianna and Darian were getting close to Sunrise Village. They memorized the path; first they have to go through the thick forest, and eventually the forest will start thinning out, leading to the front of the village.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tanae was sure nice to us, even though we were strangers.&rdquo; said Marianna.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;She showed us hospitality and welcomed us with open arms.&rdquo; Darian replied. &ldquo;I wonder if everyone in the village is like her?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Probably. But no one can cook like her. She must have a lot of practice.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll be happy to see us. And she might even feed us that soup.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ah, yes. It was so hot and it smelled good.&rdquo; Marianna said excitedly.</p></p>

<p><p>They were almost at the entrance and they smelled something afoul in the air. &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s not right.&rdquo; Darian announced. He did not know exactly what&rsquo;s wrong with the village, but his intuition told him something terrible has happened. The air smelled like death and despair.</p></p>

<p><p>They hurried over to the front gate of Sunrise and noticed that the houses were damaged, as if it was raided. They went past the front gate and Marianna gasped in horror, seeing the dead bodies on the ground.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What...what&rsquo;s going on?!&rdquo; she asked with wide open eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Something happened...were they killed by bandits? No...&rdquo; Darian saw the bite marks on the victims. &ldquo;It was demons!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>From three streets down, there was a red demon devouring the corpse of a young woman. The demon bit her flesh while ripping the corpse apart with its claws. Suddenly, upon smelling fresh meat, the demon stared at Darian and Marianna, with blood still dripping from its teeth.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna clenched a fist. &ldquo;This is unforgivable!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darian noticed her rage. &ldquo;Marianna...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She drew a sword and charged at the demons. &ldquo;Yaaaah!&rdquo; Three demons rushed at her, only to be slashed and killed. *Slish Slice Slish*</p></p>

<p><p>By now, she was so angry that she&rsquo;s beyond logic and reason. Her strength has doubled because of her anger, and she pushed her body to its limits, swinging her sword hard.</p></p>

<p><p>Everyone in the village is dead, including Old Lady Tanae, who was so kind to her and Faith during their stay here. Marianna wanted to return the favor, but it is too late now. The demons killed the old woman, and Marianna is going to give them hell.</p></p>

<p><p>After stabbing the last demon, it fell down, with her sword still lodged in its limit. Marianna pulled the sword out of its flesh and stabbed it again, causing the beast to cough blood. Marianna kept stabbing it in the same spot over and over, while screaming like a madman.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Take this! Die! Die!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Blood splattered on her face, but she kept stabbing the demon. Darian grabbed her from behind and pulled her away. &ldquo;Enough...it&rsquo;s dead already.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna looked at the demon, and indeed, it was no longer moving. She was too blinded by rage to notice that it died already. Marianna dropped her sword. *Cling*</p></p>

<p><p>After taking a few breaths, she calmed down. &ldquo;If only we came earlier...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is terrible. But there&rsquo;s nothing more we can do.&rdquo; Darian said softly. &ldquo;Right now the important thing is to go back to the temple and find Faith.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; Marianna replied in a meek voice. She was staring at the ground, ashamed of her earlier actions. (Sorry Tanae...I will avenge you...I promise)</p></p>

<p><p>Indeed, Darian&rsquo;s words are correct - everyone is dead and they cannot be brought back to life, no matter how much anger you feel. Although it may cold, they must move on. Marianna appreciates Darian being objective at a time like this - after all, he has seen a massacre before - the fallen Kingdom of Zaibach. The death of a village compared to that of a whole kingdom is nothing...isn&rsquo;t it?</p></p>

<p><p>The two traveled back to Star Hill, silent the entire trip. When they reached the long staircase, Darian finally said something. &ldquo;Listen, what happened to Sunrise Village we should hide it from Faith.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Why? She has a right to know.&rdquo; she asked as they walked up the steps.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;She is dealing with a lot right now. I don&rsquo;t want to her to have any more stress.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna sighed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. We&rsquo;re both tired so let&rsquo;s just stay at the temple for the night.&rdquo; Suddenly, she stopped walking. &ldquo;Footprints.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not Faith&rsquo;s. Whose footprints are they?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I have a bad feeling about this.&rdquo; Marianna ran up the stairs, causing Darian to match her speed.</p></p>

<p><p>The staircase stretched throughout the entire height of the hill, so it was a long climb up. When the both of them reached the top of the hill, they were both tired and panting for breath. But there was no time to rest, if Marianna&rsquo;s intuition was right. They charged into the temple and saw Magenta, a monk they recognized. He had a dumbfounded look on his face for a few seconds, then he ran away.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna saw a door that leads to the kitchen. She did not bother using the knob, she just kicked the door and broke it down. *Crack* They both entered the kitchen and gasped. They saw Faith lying on the floor, covered by a towel. Despite her eyes being open, she was lifeless and motionless.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna became full of anger and bloodlust and ran towards the main room, with Darian just a step behind her.</p></p>

<p><p>Magenta just told the other monks what happened. Cerise, Maroon, and Magenta stood in a straight line, holding wooden sticks and stood in fighting stance. They screamed and charged at the heroes. &ldquo;Yaaahhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mari loaded an arrow and shot Cerise in the thigh. *Schleb* He fell forward and dropped his stick. &ldquo;Ugh! This hurts!&rdquo; He looked up and saw Mari pointing the arrow at him and he panicked. &ldquo;No, wait! Have mercy!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> Those words did not register at all. Mari was still feeling the lingering anger of seeing the village burnt to ashes. And she has just seen her best friend in such condition. Being kidnapped and violated by monks not once, but twice? Usually, Mari is fair and shows mercy but right now she is beyond reason. Without hesitating, she shot the arrow into his heart.</p></p>

<p><p>*Schleb* Cerise had a look of shock on his face. His hand grabbed the arrow stuck to his chest to make sure it was real. In the last few moments of his life, he saw blood dripping down his clothes before he fell down, never to be awoken again.</p></p>

<p><p> Magenta attacked with his wooden stick. Darian blocked with his sword. *Clack clack* The prince knocked his stick away and slashed the monk in the chest. *Schleb* Magenta fell face flat on the floor and crawled away, trying to reach his stick. He was slow as his body felt one hundred times heavier. He was mere inches away from the stick and his hand desperately reached for it. *Schleb* Darian stabbed his neck.</p></p>

<p><p>Tears were seen dripping down his eyes as blood oozed out of his mouth. He never thought his life would end this life&#8230;in such a pathetic way. Darian pulled the sword out of his neck and flicked the blood away.</p></p>

<p><p>Meanwhile, Fuschia was hiding behind a column, watching his comrades get killed. Being an old man, it&rsquo;s only natural that he does not fight. He never cared about his fellow monks anyhow, he was worried about his own safety. He grew scared while seeing Magenta lose so much blood before getting killed in cold blood. Fuschia did not want to end up like that.</p></p>

<p><p>Mari fired arrows and Maroon knocked them away by spinning his stick like a fan. She ran out of arrows and tossed her bow away in frustration. She drew her katana and charged. She and Maroon exchanged blows. *Clack clack* It was clear that Maroon was no match for her as he kept retreating from her powerful blows.</p></p>

<p><p>He tripped on a rock and fell backwards. Mari stabbed him and blood splattered on her clothes. She did not care and continued to stab him until he did not move any longer.</p></p>

<p><p>While everyone was distracted, Fuschia slipped away undetected.</p></p>

<p><p> Mari panted for breath as she stared at the bloody corpses of the fallen monks. Darian wiped the blood off his blade with a napkin. &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; asked the concerned prince.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;ve calmed down a bit.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry this had to happen. Do you want to check on your friend now?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, let&rsquo;s clean up these dead bodies. I don&rsquo;t want Faith to see this mess.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>For an unknown amount of time, Faith has been lying in the same spot. It could have been hours or days, as there is no way to keep track of time in the isolated temple. Marianna bent down holding a cup of porridge. &ldquo;Faith, you can&rsquo;t continue like this. You have to eat something.&rdquo; She put the bowl of porridge in Faith&rsquo;s line of sight. But she showed no reaction. It&rsquo;s as if she is a living vegetable.</p></p>

<p><p>Mari grew frustrated and decided to use force. She took a spoon full of porridge and pressed it against Faith&rsquo;s lips. There was still no reaction from her. Mari pressed the spoon harder, causing Faith to turn slightly to the right. The porridge dripped down the tip of the spoon and onto her cheek, running down to her jawline.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Fine. Don&rsquo;t eat. If you think being like this will help you, then stay like this!&rdquo; Marianna put the bowl next to her friend&rsquo;s head and left the room in frustration.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How is she?&rdquo; Darian asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in bad shape, even worse than last time. She won&rsquo;t eat, talk or even move.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> Darian sighed and stood up. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve already eliminated the monks so we avenged her. The rest is up to your friend.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;I have an idea.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna barged into her friend&rsquo;s room and without saying anything, she dragged Faith by the arm and shoulder. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; Faith made no attempt to get up or resist, so basically she is just deadweight. Her body felt a lot heavier than Mari anticipated. But nonetheless, she dragged Faith&rsquo;s torso up so that she was in a sit up position.</p></p>

<p><p>She snatched both of Faith&rsquo;s arms and forced her to stand up, and then holding her by the hand, dragged her out of the room.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; Mari said to Darian, who nodded in response.</p></p>

<p><p>Holding onto Faith&rsquo;s hand, Marianna took her down the long flight of steps of Star Hill. Faith, whose mind was still shut down, followed her like a puppet. She had to move at Mari&rsquo;s pace, which was pretty fast. Several times she nearly tripped and fell, but luckily did not.</p></p>

<p><p>After traversing the forest for a few hours, Faith was tired from walking and holding Mari&rsquo;s hand. She had her first thought in a while. &ldquo;Where are you taking me?&rdquo; she finally asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh so you can talk?&rdquo; Marianna replied. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something you have to see.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting tired. Hey, isn&rsquo;t this the path to Sunrise village?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It <strong>was</strong> Sunrise village.&rdquo; Darian responded.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Faith saw the burnt down village and her facial expression and the color of her eyes changed. &ldquo;No...&rdquo; She ran towards the front gate, hoping it is some kind of prank.</p></p>

<p><p>She took a quick glance at the houses and noticed they were burned down or destroyed, and there were dead bodies lying around. Faith, who has never seen anything like this, was in a state of shock, and she put her hands over her mouth. She wanted to scream, but no sounds came out.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith stepped back until she bumped into Marianna. &ldquo;What...what this??&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna answered her. &ldquo;By the time Darian and I came here, it was already like this. The demons did it. Faith...they&rsquo;re all dead. Every single one of them.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No! It can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo; Her eyes darted left and right, looking for a particular person. &ldquo;What about Miss Tanae?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone. Everyone is.&rdquo; Marianna responded. One can tell she did not want to say the truth, but at this point, Faith needs to know the truth. Marianna herself was on the verge of tears, but she held back, clenching a fist.</p></p>

<p><p>Being locked up in a castle all her life, the princess rarely had to deal with death. But she is now experiencing death in the outside world...it&rsquo;s nothing close to what she thought it&rsquo;d be. The grotesque looks of the corpses, the rotting flesh, and the smell of corpses and smoke...all of these sensations hit her senses at once.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith thought about Old Woman Tanae, the one who showed her much kindness, even thought Faith was practically a stranger. The old woman took her in, fed her and gave her a place to sleep. Everyone in the village is kind just like Tanae. But she&rsquo;s gone...all the young men who fought the demons with pitch forks...they&rsquo;re gone too... all the women and children of the village, they&rsquo;re gone too.</p></p>

<p><p>Unable to handle all the emotions surging in her body, Faith fell down on her knees and sobbed. Marianna was about to touch her friend&rsquo;s shoulder, but Darian stopped her.</p></p>

<p><p>The tears were endless and they dripped on her fists. &ldquo;Tell me...why...why did this have to happen?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It was Rubeus.&rdquo; Darian answered. &ldquo;He sacrificed this village just so he can collect souls. Faith, what are you going to do now?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What am I going to do?&rdquo; Faith pounded her fist on the ground. *Pow* &ldquo;Rubeus must pay! They must pay. They must pay!&rdquo; She kept pounding her fist angrily, making a hole in the dirt. But then she unconsciously released a pink aura from her body, which Marianna and Darian could feel.</p></p>

<p><p>She kept pounding the ground, making a bigger and bigger hole with her powered up fist. Then Faith stood up, the energy still surging throughout her body. Darian and Marianna were surprised to see her energy level increase that much just from anger. Faith before compared to now is like day and night - Marianna has never felt such a strong ki before - except for one other time.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s back was against a tree, and there was no where left to run. One of the demons leapt at her. She shrieked and fired a pink beam, completely destroying it. The other creatures continued to inch their way towards her.</p></p>

<p><p>Her heart beat rapidly, knowing that she was at death&rsquo;s grip. She has been in countless fights before, but never in a situation as dangerous as this one.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, something in her snapped, and the expression in her eyes changed. She grew angry and screamed out loud, releasing a shockwave. The demons felt it, and they remained still, not wanting to advance further. Faith&rsquo;s body began to glow, releasing a pink aura, and that aura turned into electricity.</p></p>

<p><p>Both Marianna and Darian felt the energy, and they stared at Faith. They were both surprised at what they saw, especially Marianna, who thought she knew Faith&rsquo;s strength.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&#8230;is this?&rdquo; said Marianna. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never felt anything like this from Faith.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith continued to release the electricity from her body, while clenching her fists. Her hair was waving from the winds generated by her energy. It looked as if she was a bomb ready to explode. But her body was unable to handle such a high energy output, and she grew exhausted, and the energy disappeared completely.</p></p>

<p><p>Indeed, Faith&rsquo;s power now is the same as back then. Marianna and she have been friends for ten years, and Marianna had no idea her friend is this powerful. But then again, Faith is never one to give up and makes miracles happen during the darkest of times. As she stared at Faith&rsquo;s glow, Marianna smiled, since this is the Faith that she knows best.</p></p>

<p><p>The light coming from Faith&rsquo;s glow made Darian cover his eyes. &ldquo;Wow. Is this her true power?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna answered while smiling. &ldquo;No, this is not even half of it. But with her, we have a fighting chance against Rubeus.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I agree.&rdquo; Darian replied.</p></p>

<p><p>Not wanting to stay at the dreaded village, the group of three went back to the forest. Faith did not say a word the whole time.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, a stray red demon came out of the bushes and hissed at them. Everyone shrieked except for Darian, who immediately drew his sword. The demon charged at them, trampling on some roses, and Darian charged forward and slashed it. The demon was killed and blood spilled everywhere.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna sighed in relief. &ldquo;That gave me a scare. Was that a demon that attacked the village?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Most likely.&rdquo; Darian replied. &ldquo;There are more of them around. They must be stopped before they destroy another village.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith noticed a rose standing by itself. All the roses around it were dead but this one somehow survived, although it had the demon&rsquo;s blood. She bent down and picked it up to examine it closely. She felt that the rose represented her, in a way. A rose is strong, firm independent and can stand on its own. Just like her, this rose has survived many hardships throughout the seasons&#8230;and even survived a demon attack.</p></p>

<p><p>Without realizing it, she put her ki into the flower.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; Darian announced.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith put the rose into her pocket.</p></p>


<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="e">[ E ] - The Summoning Ceremony. Save the Kingdom!</span></p></center>

<p><p>Three suspicious figures in black hoods and rags have gathered in the forest. The two henchmen were holding torches so that Rubeus can read what&rsquo;s in the book he&rsquo;s holding.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus pulled his hood down, revealing his face. &ldquo;After destroying the Village of Sunrise, I finally have enough souls to summon a powerful demon.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Way to go, boss!&rdquo; Ren exclaimed. &ldquo;After we get the demon under our control, we can rob banks and get rich!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ren, you&rsquo;re thinking way too small. I&rsquo;m not doing this so we can commit petty crimes - oh no - I have much bigger things in mind.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Like what, boss?&rdquo; asked Arkady.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I am going to rule the Kingdom of Almerak.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p><strong> &ldquo;Rule the kingdom?&rdquo; </strong>they both replied.</p></p>

<p><p>Ren was impressed. &ldquo;Wow, as expected of Lord Rubeus. Your goals are always grand!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now, without further ado.&rdquo; Rubeus flips his cape over, revealing the book he&rsquo;s holding, and opens up to the middle of it. He begins chanting some cryptic words that no one understands.</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady and Ren are clueless when it comes to sorcery, so they waited in suspense for something to happen.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus&rsquo;s left hand began to glow as he raised it to the air. The souls were coming out from his hands and began flying into the forest. Then a black hole appeared on the ground. Ren and Arkady stepped away from it like frightened little children.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the portal to the demon world?&rdquo; asked Ren.</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady then said: &ldquo;I can sense a deep evil coming from it. I&rsquo;ve never felt anything like this before!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A claw came out of the hole and grabbed the dirt, causing Ren and Arkady to scream. The demon crawled its way up and plant its feet on the ground.</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady wiped his forehead. &ldquo;Phew. It&rsquo;s only a demon.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Look, there&rsquo;s more!&rdquo; Ren exclaimed, pointing at the hole.</p></p>

<p><p>A second demon crawled out of the hole, then a third, then they came in groups of two or three. Soon, there were too many to even count.</p></p>

<p><p>One of the red demons sniffed something with its nose. They have a keen sense of smell, especially when it comes to human blood.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith, Marianna, and Darian arrived at the forest and they could feel that something&rsquo;s wrong. &ldquo;Do you sense that?&rdquo; asked Marianna.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Darian replied. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of bloodlust coming from that direction.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A bunch of red demons appeared. These are the same type of demon that attacked Sunrise village. They are named as such because of their red skin, but also because they eat people, so they are associated with murder and blood. They are low in intelligence and they limp about like zombies, but when provoked, they can be pretty aggressive.</p></p>

<p><p>The heroes drew their swords and charged directly into the demon group. Although physically strong, red demons are slow, so the heroes have no problem taking them down.</p></p>

<p><p>After slashing the last demon, Faith noticed the villains. &ldquo;Rubeus!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re still alive?&rdquo; Ren asked, staring blankly.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take care of this.&rdquo; said Arkady.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus stopped chanting and opened his eyes. &ldquo;Hmm. What happened to the monks?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna raised her fist at him. &ldquo;Do you think an obvious trap like that would work?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady chuckled. &ldquo;Heh. You survived the fall down the cliff, you&rsquo;re stronger than I thought. But that was luck, and your luck runs out now.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>With three people on each side, everyone knew there&rsquo;s going to be three 1 on 1 battles. They all chose an opponent and split up to fight them.</p></p>

<p><p>Darian played a tune on his flute, but Rubeus was unfazed. &ldquo;I told you, your flute is useless against me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Then I have no choice.&rdquo; Darian drew his sword and charged forward.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus drew his sword as well and ran into Darian fearlessly, and they clash blades.</p></p>

<p><p>Ren used the <strong>Power Wave</strong> - he punched the ground, causing a shockwave that hurled towards Faith, and she jumped back to avoid it.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it past your bed time, princess?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith drew her sword. &ldquo;I can take anything you throw at me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh. Let&rsquo;s find out!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He powered up and his body was glowing. He threw a fireball at her, and Faith knocked the balls away like a baseball bat. *Whack*</p></p>

<p><p>Ren threw another one, and Faith knocked it away the same way. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all you got?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ren grew angry and he threw fireballs non-stop. Faith knocked them away like they were nothing. Then she swings her sword hard, causing a wind shockwave that hit him, knocking him on the ground.</p></p>

<p><p>Darian&rsquo;s sword was broken, and he&rsquo;s panting for breath. Rubeus, on the other hand, was unscathed. Darian threw away his sword and charged head on. Rubeus charged up an energy ball and it hit Darian in the chest. *Bam* It knocked him on his butt and he cannot get up anymore.</p></p>

<p><p>Meanwhile, Marianna had her grudge match with Arkady. &ldquo;Things won&rsquo;t be like last time.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady smiled. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see. This time I&rsquo;ll pierce both your legs!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Both archers took out their bow at the same time and loaded an arrow, and fired it at the same time. Marianna dodged the arrow by tilting her head, and Arkady ducked, avoiding the incoming arrow. They continued to run closer to each other, but kept their distance. Marianna loaded another arrow and fired it. Arkady dodged it, and he loaded up three arrows and fired it.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna jumped over the arrows and rolled on the ground, then landed on one knee, and aimed her arrow at her target. Arkady disappeared into the darkness of the forest. No longer visible, Marianna stood up and searched for him.</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady was hiding on one of tree branches, and his target was within his view. As he loaded an arrow, he thought that his victory was assured. Marianna closed her eyes and let her sixth sense do the searching for her. She could feel the arrow guiding her in the darkness.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, she felt a life force from above, and faced Arkady&rsquo;s direction. Arkady was shocked that she can see him. She unleashed the Celestial Arrow and Arkady jumped away, and the arrow hit the tree and exploded.</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady landed on the ground. (How did she find me?)</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna loaded yet another arrow and fired it. It hit the tree Arkady was hiding behind, causing it to explode. Arkady rolled out of the way.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s useless. No matter where you hide, I can sense you.&rdquo; said Marianna.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Arkady revealed himself. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve gotten stronger since our last fight. If hiding is useless then I will confront you directly. &rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna smirked. &ldquo;This is just what I was hoping for.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Both archers loaded their arrows at the same time and put their ki into it. Arkady fired the Demonic Arrow, an arrow charged with red ki, full of hatred and despair. On the other hand, Marianna&rsquo;s Celestial Arrow has a glow of a blue light, a ki full of hope and belief.</p></p>

<p><p>The Celestial Arrow broke through the Demonic Arrow, and went into Arkady&rsquo;s chest. The pain got him by surprise, he could see the blood gushing out of his wound. As he fell in slow motion, he had a few moments to think about his defeat. The enemy&rsquo;s attack was stronger than his Demonic Arrow, and not only that, but he was struck by it, something that moved faster than he can see. As he laid there on the ground, Arkady wondered if this is the end for him. With this kind of humiliating defeat, it might as well be. He closed his eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>Even though Marianna has won, there is no time to rest, as the demons are about to attack her. Marianna put away her bow and took out her sword, and charged into the league of demons, hacking away.</p></p>

<p><p>As Marianna is occupied with the lower demons, only Faith and Rubeus remain. As they face each other, Faith felt like this is her moment of truth - as if it&rsquo;s her destiny to fight this sorcerer. All that has happened so far - her leaving the palace - befriending the people at Sunrise village - her stay at the temple - and the destruction of the village - it was all leading up to this final battle.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Rubeus, why did you kill everyone in Sunrise Village?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It was all for this.&rdquo; He pointed at the elliptical black portal. &ldquo;This is the gateway between the human world and the demon world. It&rsquo;s magnificent, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You slaughtered everyone just for that stupid reason?! You&rsquo;re going to pay for their deaths.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmm. Can you actually stop me?&rdquo; Rubeus responded.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus threw an energy ball at Faith, and she knocked it away with her bare fist. Then Rubeus gathered three energy balls and threw them at her. She used the Energy Shot to counter them - gathering energy at the tip of her index finger and releasing it like a gun. *Bang* All three balls blew up.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Not bad.&rdquo; Rubeus commented. &ldquo;But how about this?&rdquo; This time, he gathered countless energy balls, perhaps a dozen or more. As a sorcerer, a trick of this level is nothing to him, but will Faith be able to receive this attack?</p></p>

<p><p>Faith seemed unfazed by this. She opened her palm and a dozen roses appeared. Both of them shot their projectiles into each other, all the roses hit the balls and exploded on impact. *Boom boom boom*</p></p>

<p><p>When the sparks were over, both of them were still standing. Rubeus then turned the energy in his hand into a sharp sword. Faith summoned a rose in her hand, and its stem extended all the way into the ground. This is her Vine Whip technique.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus charged at her and started hacking away with his makeshift blade, and her whip did well against it.</p></p>

<p><p>Then Faith&rsquo;s vine whip started to circle her and protect her. This is her Vine Shield technique. As Rubeus whipped his blade into the shield, it broke. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he blurted out, surprised by this new development.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Nothing can get past my Vine Shield.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He jumped away. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about it.&rdquo; He threw energy balls at the shield, but to no avail.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s useless.&rdquo; Faith declared. &ldquo;No amount of energy will break this shield.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get cocky, little girl. I&rsquo;ll show you the difference between an amateur and a professional!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus folded his hands together and chanted something, and his body glowed a white color. Then ground broke apart like an earthquake. The ground she&rsquo;s standing on started to rise, then shattered into pieces, causing her to fall.</p></p>

<p><p>Giant fingers came out of the black hole and grazed the dirt. The hand of a giant demon was coming out of the portal. Its skin is red and its fingers thick with sharp nails, like the talons of an eagle.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith, Marianna, and Darian noticed it.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus opened his eyes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re here at last...the high level demon, <strong>Beelzebub</strong>.&rdquo; He continued to chant to make the hole bigger.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re after...so summon a demon of this caliper.&rdquo; said Marianna with an angry tone.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;And what of it?&rdquo; Rubeus replied with indifference.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What do you intend to do with it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I want to control it, of course. With this powerful demon at my beck and call, I can accomplish anything.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna got angry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard enough!&rdquo; She loaded an arrow into her bow and fired it. Rubeus opened his palm and the arrow disintegrated before it ever touched him.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna gasped in surprise. &ldquo;What?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus fired a beam at her, knocking her away.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith, who was lying face down, saw her friend getting blown away. &ldquo;Marianna!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Darian showed up. &ldquo;Rubeus!&rdquo; He charged forward with his broken sword. Even though he knows he has no chance of wining, he figured he&rsquo;d try anyway, it&rsquo;s better than sleeping on the ground and biting the dust.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus blasted him away, Darian hit a tree and fell down. *Thud*</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Darian!&rdquo; Faith cried out. She tried to crawl, but did not have the strength to do so. &ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Then Rubeus walked over to the portal. By now, there were two giant hands coming out of the pit of darkness. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Not quite.&rdquo; Marianna replied.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You just don&rsquo;t know when to give up. Like an annoying insect.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, Marianna!&rdquo; shouted Faith desperately.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna loaded an arrow, but this time, Rubeus blasted her before she could even fire it. *Bam*</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Noooooo!&rdquo; Faith pounded her fist on the ground. &ldquo;Damn it. Is this how it&rsquo;s going to end?&rdquo; As if answering to her cries for help, she hears a voice, the familiar voice of an old man. She looked around, thinking the voice is coming from the sky, but it&rsquo;s actually coming from inside her head.</p></p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s the voice of her father, King Midas, a strong and proud man. &ldquo;Faith...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;F-Father?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A long time ago, when the princess was a little girl, she was playing in the garden. Her father came over and pet her on the head.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Faith, you&rsquo;re the daughter of the Midas family. We have been rulers of the kingdom generation after generation. We are a proud family of conquerors and rulers, and just like your father, you have the blood of royalty. I am proud of you, my daughter. You can become anything you want to be, you can more powerful than you even think - because you&rsquo;re a Midas. Never forget that.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>At that time, she was too young to understand his words - she completely forgot about it - until now. Now she understands what he means. Midas&rsquo;s encouraging words give her strength. Faith&rsquo;s father was the first one to teach her combat basics - despite her being a girl. Everything she knows about martial arts and swordsmanship she learned from Midas.</p></p>

<p><p>With Faith&rsquo;s newfound strength, she can stand up on her feet again, despite being battered and bruised all over. Suddenly, her tiredness mattered not anymore. A pink aura began emanating from her body and Rubeus can feel it.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What? You can still stand?&rdquo; Rubeus cried out. &ldquo;What is this ki I&rsquo;m feeling?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith clenched her fists and held her arms out, and she looked up at the sky as the energy surged throughout her body. Her hair was flowing and she felt light as a feather, like never before.</p></p>

<p><p>So this is what it feels like to be on top of the world? This is the best feeling ever - and she had the potential all this time. Several times before she almost unleashed her full power - that time outside the Sunrise Village, when Faith was surrounded by demons - and that time when the monks surrounded her - and that time when the village was destroyed.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith screamed out loud, releasing all the excess energy stored inside of her. A gust of wind blew everything. *Froom*</p></p>

<p><p>Darian opened his eyes. &ldquo;This is the princess&rsquo;s true power? Amazing!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna smiled, despite hurting all over. &ldquo;Faith...so this is your true power, eh? I always knew you could do it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus was taken aback by this new development. &ldquo;This can&rsquo;t be right. She&rsquo;s just a little girl! She&rsquo;s supposed to be weak!&rdquo; The wind blew in his face. &ldquo;Aaagh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was done powering up, and the dirt and rocks around her dropped down. A pink outline surrounded her body. And the look in her eyes is completely different than before. &ldquo;Rubeus...your time is up.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The giant arms continued to crawl its way out of the dark portal, and the demon&rsquo;s head appeared. It was shaped like a skull, its eye sockets were empty and lifeless, and as a dark as the portal itself.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus smirked in disbelief. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re threatening me, Princess of Almerak? You don&rsquo;t know who you&rsquo;re dealing with.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just a petty thief and a murderer.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; Rubeus formed an energy ball in his hands the size of a volleyball, and he threw it at her.</p></p>

<p><p>*Boom!* Faith formed the Vine Shield, rendering his attack useless.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus gathered dozens of energy balls and threw them at her. Faith charged into the balls, confident she can get through them. The balls hit the ground and exploded, and Faith jumped over those. Some balls hit her on the arm and exploded in her face, but that did not slow her down at all.</p></p>

<p><p>The sorcerer panicked, seeing how fast she&rsquo;s running at him. Faith drew her fist back. &ldquo;Tiger Fist!!&rdquo; She hit him in the stomach with everything she&rsquo;s got, and Rubeus coughed saliva.</p></p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s the first time he&rsquo;s been struck this badly by anyone, and he stumbled backwards, grabbed his wound and coughed. &ldquo;Ugh...uhhh...you little shit.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing compared to the pain you caused the people of the village.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Is this where your power is coming from?&rdquo; Rubeus asked, with one hand on his stomach. &ldquo;Revenge? Why do you care so much about those weaklings?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith got angry and fired a beam at him. *Wham* It hit him in the shoulder and knocked him on the floor.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus stood up with a hand over his shoulder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to defeated by a princess!&rdquo; He folded his hands and started chanting.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith knew he&rsquo;s up to no good. She fired the Energy Shot, but an invisible force field protected him, and the shot bounced off him. The spell allows Rubeus to release all the energy he has stored up until now in the form of a beam. He can fire it at will, essentially turning his body into a ticking time bomb.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith winced from the light. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going all out. Fine, I will do that too!&rdquo; She gathered all the energy she had into her palms, forming a pink ball of energy.</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady and Ren watched dumbfounded at this turn of events. They&rsquo;re both defeated, and all they can do is pray for their master&rsquo;s victory.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus opened his eyes, and he released the Spirit Beam. Faith fired the Mega Beam, a thick, pink beam of pure energy that destroys anything it touches. The two forces collided...and the Mega Beam, as it&rsquo;s more concentrated, broke through, and hit Rubeus directly, pushing him away. &ldquo;Uuhhhh! Impossible!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Everything suddenly became white and he was sent flying to the air. (I lost to her?) Suddenly, Rubeus&rsquo;s whole life flashed before his eyes. Everything he&rsquo;s done up to now was for the summoning ceremony - and he&rsquo;s only moments away from achieving his goals - but now he&rsquo;s going to lose? He spent so much time planning and scheming things, and he&rsquo;d even go as far as to ruin an entire village just to collect souls - did he do all that work for nothing?</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus was about to fall into the dark portal, and the demon&rsquo;s hand grabbed him. The portal was closing, and the demon was sinking into the hole, pulling Rubeus down with him. &ldquo;No! NOOOOOO!&rdquo; screamed the frantic sorcerer. The demon sunk completely into the darkness, and the portal closed.</p></p>

<p><p>Nothing&rsquo;s left but the ground, and it seems like there was never a portal to begin with. Now that it&rsquo;s over, Faith suddenly feels tired and weak in the knees. She fell on her knees and sighed in relief.</p></p>

<p><p>The princess&rsquo;s long journey has come to a conclusion at last. A lot of things has happened since Faith ran away from the imperial palace, and she has visited new places, met some interesting people, defeated bad guys, and experienced many new things, both good and bad. The danger is over and now she can finally take a break and take in everything that&rsquo;s happened so far.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus was nowhere to be found, so they presumed him dead. Faith, as part of her newfound abilities, can now heal whenever she wills it. She healed Marianna and Darian just by touching their skin. As for the criminals Ren and Arkady, they have been arrested by the police and sent to prison for a long, long time. Still in grief over their master&rsquo;s death, they did not fight back, and let themselves be at the mercy of the authorities.</p></p>

<p><p>Now that the crisis is over, the heroes return to the abandoned house to say their goodbyes. &ldquo;You have go so soon?&rdquo; asked Faith.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I have no time to waste.&rdquo; Darian replied. &ldquo;I must find Vega and get revenge for my fallen kingdom. It was a pleasure meeting you both.&rdquo; He went over to kiss Marianna&rsquo;s hand and Faith&rsquo;s hand. They were both delighted at his gentlemen-like ways.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ll see each other again.&rdquo; said Marianna.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps one day.&rdquo; Darian replied while walking away. He took out his flute and played it one last time for the ladies, a farewell requiem as a token of their friendship.</p></p>

<p><p>Although they were both sad to see him go, they knew that Prince Darian cannot stick with them forever. Eventually he has to part ways, for he has his own journey to complete. But Faith has a feeling that they&rsquo;ll meet again - perhaps sooner than they think.</p></p>

<p><p>Marianna then turned to her best friend. &ldquo;So...after all that&rsquo;s happened, you must be tired of the outside world. I&rsquo;d understand if you want to go back to the palace.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith turned her head. &ldquo;No way. There&rsquo;s so much to see in the world. All the places that we&rsquo;ve been to were nothing compared to the size of the world.&rdquo; Then she stared at her best friend. &ldquo;Like I said, I won&rsquo;t be satisfied until I experience <strong>all</strong> the world has offer, remember?&rdquo;</p></p>
