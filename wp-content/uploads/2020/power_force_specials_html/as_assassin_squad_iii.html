</span></p></center>


<p><p>After much struggling and fighting, Tyson finally found the room where they kept Faith. It felt like forever since they&rsquo;ve been separated, but time is nothing when it comes to love. However, his body was worn out, and despite that, he continued to fight his way into the lab. Two soldiers lay unconscious on the floor. Those were the last of the enemies.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson was too tired to stand up and he grabbed his wounds and fell on his knees, but the keyboard panel broke his fall. &ldquo;Ugh...Faith...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She was sleeping in the glass tube, filled with water, or some form of liquid. She was naked, wrapped in a towel, with wires attached to her limbs. Despite the wires and the mechanical surroundings, she still looks beautiful, like an angel who&rsquo;s been sleeping for a hundred years. Since they were separated, Tyson had a hard time sleeping or eating, or even thinking. All he could think about was to get Faith back, all his energy was focused into that single goal. And now, his goal has finally been accomplished.</p></p>

<p><p>He pushed the red button on the keyboard, and then fell down on the floor. The machines started making mechanical noises, and the glass tube door released some air. The water was drained the chamber, and the wires detached from her body. Finally, the door opened, and she fell out of it, along with a puddle of water.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson crawled forward, reaching his hand for her. &ldquo;F-Faith! Wake up! Wake up!&rdquo; She was all the way across the room, and it felt like she&rsquo;s very far from him. He screamed her name desperately, while inching his way towards her.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s eyes blinked a little, and as Tyson kept calling her name, she came into consciousness. Her vision was blurry and her hearing was distorted, but there&rsquo;s a man&rsquo;s voice crying out her name, and he sounds like Tyson. Then she became fully awake and saw Tyson in front of her. &ldquo;Tyson!&rdquo; she said.</p></p>

<p><p>As he crawled towards Faith, she crawled towards him. Eventually, their fingers touched and they held each other&rsquo;s hands tightly. &ldquo;I found you at last.&rdquo; he said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d come for me.&rdquo; she replied.</p></p>

<p><p>To be reunited under these circumstances was not exactly the ideal reunion. But in that moment, they forgot about the fact that they are in the enemy&rsquo;s spaceship. They are inside a lab with broken machines, broken glass and water on the floor, and two other unconscious soldiers. Enemies could pop into the room at anytime. But all they can see is each other, all they have is each other...<strong>it is a world for two</strong>.</p></p>

<p><p>Both of them have been through hell, they were tired both physically and mentally...especially Faith. Tyson held her hand tightly, and this time he will not let go no matter what. They just stared at each other without saying a word. They both had no words to say, they just smiled stupidly.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, some white wires appeared out of thin air and headed towards Faith. These wires were thin and looked like wires made of light, and it seemed that all of them originated from the same point on the wall.</p></p>

<p><p>When Tyson saw them coming, he was dumbfounded. His guard was down and he thought he finally found a moment of peace, but it seems that peace will be taken away from him by some dark, invisible force.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; she asked innocently.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; he blurted out.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was confused, but the look on Tyson&rsquo;s face was serious. She felt something on her leg and gasped. The tentacle-like wires wrapped itself around her left leg, and the others wrapped themselves around her waist, causing her to scream. &ldquo;Aaaah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Faith!!&rdquo; Tyson yelled.</p></p>

<p><p>The wires moved quickly, they migrated from her waist to her torso, and some of them caught her arms. At the same time, the wires that have her legs pulled her away.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tyson!&rdquo; she screamed. Faith has no idea what is going on, but she only knows one thing for sure - she does not want to be separated from Tyson again. There was fear in her eyes...the fear of losing her loved one, after waiting so long to see him again...</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No!!&rdquo; With him lying down, he could not do much, except for holding onto her wrist. He could only grab her wrist with one hand, as his other hand was on the floor and being used to leverage his head off the floor.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;T-Tyson!&rdquo; Faith screamed desperately.</p></p>

<p><p>He lost his grip on her wrist, but he still held onto her fingers. The wires kept on pulling her body, and unfortunately, no matter how hard he held her fingers, the wires were stronger. He was in a weakened state, and it was only a matter of time before their hands were pulled apart, and they stared into each other&rsquo;s eyes like desperate lambs about to be slaughtered.</p></p>

<p><p>Seconds later, her fingers slipped away from his grip. <strong>&ldquo;No!! Faith!&rdquo;</strong></p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No!!&rdquo; Faith screamed. When their fingers lost touch, their world fell apart. She was devastated as she was pulled further and further away. She can&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s behind her or what&rsquo;s pulling her, but she can sense it&rsquo;s definitely something sinister and evil.</p></p>

<p><p>The wires had already tied up both her arms and her shoulders, and her stomach, and they pulled her away, inch by inch. She tried to crawl forward, but her arms did little to resist the wires. Poor Faith was helpless as she was being dragged away from the one she loves.</p></p>

<p><p>Her face was one of fear and pain...and since she can&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s behind her, it is like being dragged into the darkness itself...</p></p>

<p><p>Faith has been through a lot already, getting thrown from one compromising situation to the next. She was captured and taken to Indigo&rsquo;s ship, and treated like a lab rat, tortured mercilessly. They did all kinds of unspeakable things to her body, and it felt like she spent an eternity in captivity. It is too much for a delicate woman like her to handle.</p></p>

<p><p>She resisted with her entire body...not wanting to be dragged into the darkness again. All those horrible memories suddenly entered her mind...</p></p>

<p><p>And now, she finally finds one moment of peace, only for it to be taken away. She only saw Tyson in her vision, and kept yelling his name in vain. Her arm desperately reached for him, but she was dragged further and further away from him.</p></p>

<p><p>The wires pulled on her limbs, forcing her to get on her knees. &ldquo;Uuuh...&rdquo; Now Faith was kneeling and her arms extended horizontally to the side. The wires movements were methodically, as if being controlled by a single mind. They looped around her arm, moving towards her wrist, and then tightened its loops.</p></p>

<p><p>Wires were wrapped around her thighs, and the loops grew tighter, causing Faith much pain. &ldquo;Ugh! Uugh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Other wires appeared and looped around her waist, traveled up to her stomach, and wrapped themselves around her breasts, squeezing the towel against her body. The wires were merciless as they systematically took over her body and tightened the loops on her breasts, arms and thighs. &ldquo;Ugh...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?!&rdquo; Tyson crawled with both arms, but he only moved a little bit.</p></p>

<p><p>One of the wires was wrapped around her neck, and it became extremely uncomfortable for Faith. Her whole body was being bound and now she&rsquo;s choking as well. &ldquo;Ugh...uuh!!&rdquo; she moaned.</p></p>

<p><p>Poor Faith can&rsquo;t even catch a break. After all she&rsquo;s been through, all she wants is a moment of peace, so she can be alone. She&rsquo;s been experimented on and tortured, and her body and spirit was exhausted. She had no strength left to fight back, let alone escape. She barely has energy to stay awake.</p></p>

<p><p>Her eyes were shut as she moaned and groaned from the pain the wires caused her. They grew tighter around her legs, and tighter around her breasts. She felt as if her body&rsquo;s going to be torn to pieces, much like a vase that&rsquo;s been dropped on a hard floor.</p></p>


<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="b">Taken Away By Force </span></p></center>

<p><p>Tyson cannot stand the sight of his woman being in such pain. He crawled forward, reaching for her, despite the pain in his ribs. He stopped crawling when he heard a devilish laughter. The origin of the voice was behind Faith. Suddenly, the man became visible.</p></p>

<p><p>He was wearing a black suit, actually it&rsquo;s more of the body armor variety. His entire body was clad in metal, from head to toe. His boots were made of a silver alloy, which goes up all the way to his shin. There was a plate around his waist, and its color matches the boots. His forearms were covered in silver armor as well. The only parts of his body not covered were his bare hands and his face. Tyson also noticed he has black shoulder pads, a chest plate, and a head piece. His eyes were slanted and narrow, and he has dark blue hair tied to a pony tail.</p></p>

<p><p>He had his arms crossed and was laughing the whole time he became visible. Now it is clear that all the wires were protruding out of his body&rsquo;s armor. Some came out of his arms, some his legs, but most of them came out of his obliques.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson instantly hated this guy. &ldquo;Who are you?! Let her go!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oops, did I interrupt your little moment?&rdquo; <strong>Saran</strong> had remained invisible, waiting for this moment.</p></p>

<p><p>He snapped his fingers and the wires moved according to his will. They dragged Faith into the air, hanging her like a puppet. &ldquo;Aahhh!!&rdquo; she screamed.</p></p>

<p><p>Everything the tentacles did caused her pain, and she was constantly screaming.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Stop it!!&rdquo; Tyson said, reaching his arm forward.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You care about this woman, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The wires made Faith&rsquo;s arms extend horizontally as the loops tightened around her skin. Her fingers wanted to form a fist, but she had no strength left to do so, so her palms remained open. The wires all over her body tightened, causing her pain all over. They tied up her breasts and squeezed them hard. &ldquo;Ugh...uhhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The wires on her legs continued to expand to cover up her whole leg, extending from the knee to the ankles, and the knee to the thighs. The wires on her thighs inched their way into the towel, violating the area between her legs. &ldquo;Ughhh uhhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The wire that&rsquo;s around her neck made another loop, causing much discomfort on her neck. &ldquo;Ugh! Uhhhh!&rdquo; she groaned in agony.</p></p>

<p><p>She was nothing but a mere puppet in Saran&rsquo;s control. Her body was being treated like it&rsquo;s a ragged doll, ready to be torn apart at any moment.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let her go! You&rsquo;ll regret it!!&rdquo; Tyson shouted angrily. Saran noticed the look in Tyson&rsquo;s eyes, and became concerned for a split second. Those were the eyes of an angry sayan who&rsquo;s about to explode and destroy everything in his path. Normally those eyes would pierce the confidence of the strongest warriors. But Saran hardly took him seriously, considering that Tyson is lying on the floor, unable to do anything.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran smiled wickedly. Staying invisible and waiting for the right moment to strike was well worth the wait. He is not worried at all, since this situation is to his advantage. Tyson is injured and lying down like an animal, and the woman is completely helpless, hanging in the air with her life at his disposal. It&rsquo;s a situation of complete dominance for Saran.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ooh, scary. You want to save your woman, don&rsquo;t you? But what can you do in your condition? Haha.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Saran snapped his fingers. The wires from his body began to glow. The <strong>electricity</strong> traveled all the way from Saran to Faith&rsquo;s body. Once it reached her, she screamed in agony. &ldquo;Aaaaaaahh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Not only was she being suspended in the air, bound by tentacles, but now she&rsquo;s being electrocuted.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; screamed Tyson, pounding his fists on the ground. Not be able to save Faith has taken his frustration to the extreme. He already failed to save her once, when Spidey kidnapped her. But no matter how angry he was, his body would not respond to his will.</p></p>

<p><p>Poor Faith was helpless as she was dangled in the air. Her eyes were closed and she screamed at the top of her lungs from being electrocuted. The wires drained her of her energy and transferred it into Saran. Absorbing her energy made him ecstatic and it felt good. He extended his arms to the side, opened his palms, and laughed out loud.</p></p>

<p><p>Her fingers closed up to form a fist, but the zapping was too much to handle, and she couldn&rsquo;t even control a single part of her body. Her fingers opened up as she continued to suffer and scream for her dear life.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let her go...she&rsquo;s got nothing to do with this!&rdquo; Tyson said. At this point, he accepted his own helplessness and would even resort to begging. Anything is better than watching the woman he loves suffer before his very eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran snapped his fingers. The wires then put Faith on the floor, directly in front of Saran. Her legs were spread out diagonally and her arms extended horizontally. She was barely conscious and her head was facing down and her eyes were shut.</p></p>

<p><p>Some of the wires have released themselves from her body, the ones on her wrists and ankles remained to lock her movements.</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;So this is your woman, huh? Mind if I borrow her for a moment?&rdquo; He put his arm around her neck, forcing her to lift her head up. He smelled her hair and sighed. &ldquo;Mmmm she smells good.&rdquo; His fingers held her chin up and his face was in her hair. But half his face can be seen, and he was smiling. He was doing this just to make Tyson mad, but he was also enjoying himself.</p></p>

<p><p>He moved his hands under her arms and grabbed her breasts. Faith <strong>groaned</strong> from the discomfort. He smelled her hair while groping her. &ldquo;Oooh so round and soft! Mmmm.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Stop!!&rdquo; Tyson yelled. Enough is enough...there&rsquo;s only so much one man can handle. He pushed himself off the floor, and managed to get on his knees.</p></p>

<p><p>A soldier came from behind and whacked him with the back of his rifle. *Wham* This caught him by surprise, causing him to fall down on his face.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran laughed. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Both him and the soldier chuckled.</p></p>

<p><p>The soldier was someone that Tyson had knocked out earlier, but now he&rsquo;s awake, and he was behind Tyson all this time, waiting to make a surprise strike. Tyson was weak to begin with, and after that hit, there is no way he can stand up again.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran continued to squeeze Faith&rsquo;s breasts. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t even save a single woman? How pathetic!&rdquo; he taunted. &ldquo;Heh heh heh.&rdquo; The soldier chuckled as well.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith moaned as she was being violated. Tyson was angry, but he couldn&rsquo;t move his body. His arm reached for her while he watched helplessly as his woman was being mistreated.</p></p>

<p><p>He was enjoying this very much, taunting the fallen warrior and violating this helpless woman. His hands showed no mercy at all as they squeezed her breasts firmly, pulling them apart and squishing them together like they were his toys.</p></p>

<p><p>But he was not done yet, he wanted to take this even further. Saran&rsquo;s left hand moved down her back and grabbed her butt, causing her to moan a little. His hand went around her hip and to the front of her thigh.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now...I wonder what&rsquo;s down here...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No! Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Tyson yelled.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran&rsquo;s hand glided its way on her thigh, inching towards her womanhood. &ldquo;Almost there...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, his hand went into the towel and started violating her lady spot. Faith screamed out loud, her head tossing and turning. She squirmed and her legs were shaking.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran&rsquo;s right hand was still groping her right breast, while his left violated her vital spot. He laughed.</p></p>

<p><p> Tyson was angry but he had no strength left to stand. He pounded his fists on the floor. The soldier laughed.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran then bent down, hugging her waist from behind. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s good, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He put his hand between her legs, moving it up the towel. She screamed. Then he grabbed her left leg and he licked it. He licked her shin, and moved it all the way to her quad, his face really close to the towel.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith couldn&rsquo;t do anything. All she could do was moan as he violated her in front of Tyson.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran stood up and put his arm around her shoulder, and the other hand holding her arm. He started to lick her wrist, and sliding his tongue slowly down her forearm. He wanted to taste her arm completely and did it as slow as possible. His tongue went from her forearm to her triceps, and continued the licking to her shoulder.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith moaned. He licked her shoulder and her neck. She turned her head to the side. &ldquo;Ugh!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>For some reason, violating this poor woman in front of his enemy is a turn on for him. Saran enjoyed this savage behavior... and now he will take it to the next level...</p></p>

<p><p>He placed his right arm around her torso, while his right hand was holding her left shoulder, forcing her to lower diagonally. This was the moment he was waiting for all this time. He leaned in and kissed her on the lips.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was taken completely by surprise. &ldquo;<strong>MMMMFFFF</strong>!!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Saran wanted to do this from the start, as everything before this was just foreplay. He wanted to explore her body piece by piece...licking it and groping it all over...and now it's time for the main course. He swallowed her lips completely, tasting every inch of it...and his eyes were closed as he wanted to savor every second of it.</p></p>

<p><p>Poor Faith was completely helpless in this situation...all she could do was make a moaning noise while her lips were devoured by him. Her eyes were shut and they twitched from the discomfort. She was too tired and had no energy left to move, not even enough to open her eyes. Although seemingly unconscious, she was still awake, and felt the pain entirely. She felt everything that was being done to her, especially now.</p></p>

<p><p>The poor woman was nothing more than a doll, literally a stringed puppet under the mercy of this cruel man. Her whole body shook from the shock of the kiss, but the shaking was minimal due to the wires. Her fingers twitched a little bit...but those were all the movements she could make.</p></p>

<p><p>And she had no idea how or why this was happening to her. First, she saw Tyson in front of her, and in the next moment, she was violated by a bunch of wires. And some guy appeared out of nowhere and started violating her. And now his lips are swallowing hers.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson was really mad, and he pounded his fists on the ground in frustration. &ldquo;Stop it! Stop it you bastard!&rdquo; But no matter how hard he screamed, his lower body would not respond, and he continued to watch in rage and helplessness as the enemy violated his woman&rsquo;s lips further.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran made the lip lock last as long as possible, ignoring the fallen man&rsquo;s tirade.</p></p>

<p><p>When Saran was finally done with the kiss, he released his lips from hers, putting her body back in front of him.</p></p>

<p><p>The wires from his body bounded her arms behind her back. She moaned from the pain.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well it&rsquo;s been fun.&rdquo; Saran snapped his fingers.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, the wall exploded. *Kaboom* There was a big hole on the wall, and they can see the sky. The ship was already flying and everyone can feel the wind coming from the hole.</p></p>

<p><p>The soldier from the rifle covered his eyes from the excess wind. Faith was still semi-conscious from the torture. Things were happening too fast, and having no control of her situation, she has no idea what&rsquo;s going on, nor does she care. She only knows that she will be separated from Tyson...and enter the darkness again...</p></p>

<p><p>Her eyes opened slightly. &ldquo;T-Tyson...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>From the hole in the wall, they can see another spaceship not far away.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran quickly glanced behind him. &ldquo;Oh look, my ride is here. By the way, this ship is set to crash into the nearest mountain in...oh say 10 minutes.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson gasped.</p></p>

<p><p>Soldier: &ldquo;Wait, what about me?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Saran smiled. &ldquo;Good luck to ya! Later, suckers!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Saran jumped into the air, taking Faith with him. They flew into the neighboring ship.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No!!&rdquo; screamed Tyson.</p></p>

<p><p>The current ship, was falling and heading to certain doom, and Tyson screamed as his fate went with the spaceship.</p></p>


<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="c">Saran's Spaceship - 1 </span></p></center>

<p><p>Saran was standing inside the observation room of his ship. The room was entirely empty, except for a chair in the middle, the chair that Saran uses to meditate. Faith was lying on the floor unconscious. She just woke up and became startled.</p></p>

<p><p>She quickly rolled over to her back, so her back was on the floor and crawled away. Saran slowly approached her as she crawled backwards.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran had a wicked smile on his lips. This ship is his domain, where he has control over everything, including her life. Without anyone in the way, he can take his time and have fun with her. He grew excited, thinking about all the dirty things he wanted to do to her. And since they have all the time in the world, he will devour her slowly.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...stay away!&rdquo; Faith crawled as his shadow approached.</p></p>

<p><p>His wires came out of his limbs and chest and went for her. Faith gasped. &ldquo;No! Please!&rdquo; She remembered the pain the wires has caused her, and she did not want to go through that again.</p></p>

<p><p>She turned over to her stomach and crawled towards the wall. The wires grabbed her right ankle and tied a knot around it. She crawled for her dear life. The wires tied up her left ankle and pulled her legs.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran was chuckling the whole time as the wires did the work for him. They pulled her closer to him.</p></p>

<p><p>The wires made her turn over to face him, and they kept on coming. She screamed in terror. The wires caught her wrists. She struggled but in vain. She was too weak to fight back. Even at full strength, she doubt that she can resist the wires.</p></p>

<p><p>Poor Faith has never been violated in such a way before. Never would she thought this is how it ends up.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran was of course enjoying this. He controls the wires with his mind. This is like a walk in the park for him.</p></p>

<p><p>No matter how much she struggled, it was all futile. She kept her arms over her chest and her knees bent. The wires on her wrists spread into her forearms, tightening the loops. The wires on her ankles looped themselves up the shin. Faith was losing every second...she held on as long as she could, but only for a short time.</p></p>

<p><p>The wires pulled her arms to the side, and spread open her legs. &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; she screamed. They stretched all her limbs, causing her much physical pain. Faith moaned the whole time.</p></p>

<p><p>The wires then pulled her body up, making her stand up. Her arms were raised vertically. She was helpless against the wires, unable to put a decent struggle. But now she can&rsquo;t even move...Then Saran walked towards her. Her eyes opened slightly. &ldquo;W-What do you want?&rdquo; she asked meekly.</p></p>

<p><p>He grabbed her chin and kissed her lips.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mmmmffff!&rdquo; Her eyes grew wide open as she moaned.</p></p>

<p><p>The spaceship just crashed into a mountain, resulting in a big explosion and pieces of metal flying everywhere. Moments later, things quieted down and smoke came out of the ship&rsquo;s remains.</p></p>

<p><p>A man&rsquo;s hand reached out from the pile of rubble. Then Tyson stood up, and pieces of metal and rock fell off his body. He was in very bad shape, injured from the explosion, and he was already exhausted to begin with. His shirt had holes on it and his pants have rips and holes. Blood dripped out of his forehead. This crash would have killed anybody, but not Tyson Spade. But still, he barely made it out alive in his condition. He panted for breath, barely having enough strength to stand up, even stay awake.</p></p>

<p><p>He swore revenge on Saran, someone he just met, but hates deeply. But before that, he felt like taking a nap. He collapsed on the pile of rubble. *Smash*</p></p>

<p> <p>Faith could not move a muscle as her wrists and ankles were tied up by wires protruding from Saran&rsquo;s torso. Even though they were thin, each one was as sturdy as steel and sharp as a needle. With all her limbs disabled, she was nothing but a sitting duck, completely dominated by this man.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran was standing in front of her, leering at her body.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please...don&rsquo;t do this!&rdquo; she begged. Her voice was pretty desperate, but who can blame her, considering her situation? His hand grabbed her breast and squeezed it through the towel.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;S-Stop...uhhh! Uhhhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmmm, very soft, yet firm.&rdquo; he commented. He moved his head forward so that his cheek was touching her cheek. His hand kept squeezing her breast.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Uhhhh!&rdquo; She continued to moan, her face wincing and her head turning to the side. &ldquo;Uhhhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, he was done playing with her breast. &ldquo;Hmm. This is too easy...how boring.&rdquo; Both his hands wrapped themselves around her torso, caressing the towel on her back. He placed his lips on her shoulder and kissed it, smacking his lips all over it, and gliding his lips towards her neck. Faith moaned lightly from his touches. &ldquo;Uhhh...uh...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Where was all that feistiness you showed earlier? I saw your fight with Spidey.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>One of Faith&rsquo;s eyes opened. &ldquo;Spidey?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>When looking at her opponent, Faith suddenly grew angry instead of scared. Spidey is probably not even human, it is uncertain what he is. He may be smaller than average, but he is more perverse and creepy than other Assassin Squad members. Not only he is a dirty creature, but he fights dirty as well. With those goggles, the long nose, the long chin, and his wet, slimy tongue, he&rsquo;s nothing short of grotesque.</p></p>

<p><p>And this is the creature that groped her breasts and did all those dirty things to her. Faith grew more and more annoyed, and she let her arms drop to the side, and her fingers clenched into a fist.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So...everyone in the Assassin Squad is like you?&rdquo; Her fists clenched harder. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll...you&rsquo;ll pay for this you creep!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith charged forward and let out a fury of fists. Spidey dodged them all. *Whoosh whoosh*</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha! In the Assassin Squad I am the fastest and most versatile one!&rdquo; he bragged, while dodging left and right.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right...I was watching.&rdquo; said Saran. As he talked, he continued to kiss her shoulder and neck. His hands moved lower on her back. &ldquo;Despite your situation, you were magnificent...such a strong will...&rdquo; One hand grabbed her butt cheek and squeezed it.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Uhhh...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So strong and firm...&rdquo; He squeezed her butt cheek harder. The towel was thin and he could feel the contents under it.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Uuhhhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;And your fight with Navy...you showed such potential...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith continued to power up, releasing all the ki she had in reserve. Electric sparks flared from her body. *Froom* The shield continued to expand little by little, and with each passing second, its power increased dramatically.</p></p>

<p><p>The assassins winced from the excess wind. They were bewildered by her abilities.</p></p>

<p><p>Navy&rsquo;s jaw nearly dropped as he checked his scouter. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be&#8230;how can this woman have such a high power level?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua and Teal were just as shocked as he was. But it&rsquo;s still too early to be surprised &ndash; because she still has a lot of unused ki left to be summoned.</p></p>

<p><p>As Faith powered up, she grunted heavily, as the energy puts a strain on her body. Her legs were bent, her elbows bent, her fists clenched tightly. Her body produced electric sparks as powerful as 10,000 volts of electricity. Zzzzzzzzzt. Even the ground began to shake.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith released a shockwave, screaming at the top of her lungs. &ldquo;Hyaaaaaah!&rdquo; She exploded as if she was a bomb, destroying the landscape around her. *Boom* The assassins winced and covered their eyes from the brightness.</p></p>

<p><p>All that&rsquo;s left of the grass fields was a big crater, with Faith in the center of it. Chunks of dirt and rock floated up all around Faith, and the electricity smashed them into pieces.</p></p>

<p><p>The assassins, still standing on the crater, were bewildered. Teal clenched his fists in disbelief, as he can clearly see this woman&rsquo;s power. Navy checked her power reading again, and he grunted angrily.</p></p>

<p><p>As her power increased, more rock chunks floated up. The electricity from her body became more intense, turning into a vibrant pink color.</p></p>

<p><p>While that was happening, Saran was invisible, watching the whole thing transpire from a distance.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Your energy, your form, your body...Such elegance, grace and beauty.&rdquo; He squeezed both her butt cheeks, causing her to moan some more. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I must have you...make you mine.&rdquo;</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="d">Saran's Spaceship - 2 </span></p></center>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo; Upon Saran&rsquo;s will, the wires tossed her body against the wall. *Thud* She moaned from the impact. The wires untied her limbs, much to her surprise. &ldquo;Since I&rsquo;m such a nice guy...I&rsquo;ll give you a chance. Let&rsquo;s see what you can do.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith leaned against the wall and she instinctively cross her arms over her breasts.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon.&rdquo; Saran said, spreading his arms out to the side. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m giving you a chance to fight back.&rdquo; He decided to release her because he did not see her as a threat, but rather, a form of entertainment. He was relaxed and not worried a bit.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith panted for breath as she stood there like a deer in headlights. Her hand clutched the towel against her breasts tightly. Her body was completely exhausted after all she&rsquo;s been through. She could barely stand up straight, and her legs were shaking. Perhaps shaking from the exhaustion, or the fact that she&rsquo;s afraid of Saran, but whatever the reason is isn&rsquo;t important...she is in no condition to fight back.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran grew bored of waiting and he took a step forward. &ldquo;Well, c&rsquo;mon? What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>With each step he took, his shadow on the wall grew bigger, and Faith grew more frightened. She was very well aware of Saran&rsquo;s abilities...he&rsquo;s too dangerous a foe to face...he may look like a man but to her, he&rsquo;s a monster. The wires that his body produces are not normal at all... Even if she wasn&rsquo;t exhausted, she knows she is no match for him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon. This is your one chance to escape.&rdquo; Saran took a step to the side, and his shadow moved with him.</p></p>

<p><p>The word escape caused her to have a glimmer of hope. If she can escape, she can finally be free and won&rsquo;t be tortured anymore. She&rsquo;s been violated by the wires over and over, and the last thing she wants is to be touched by those things again. Right now, escape is all she wants and the only thing in her mind.</p></p>

<p><p>Her right hand dropped to the side and she attempted to form a fist. But her fingers were shaking and unable to close. Even though she was tired and scared, she had to try...she willed her fingers to close and form a first.</p></p>

<p><p> It will work, she thought to herself. It has to work. She took a deep breath and shut her eyes for a whole second, and just charged forward. Without any hesitation, she threw her fist at him.</p></p>

<p><p>*Woosh* Saran side-stepped to avoid it, and grabbed her forearm with his fingers. The wires on his forearms went to her arm and tied it up.</p></p>

<p><p>She freaked out, trying to pull away. Her left hand grabbed the wires to pry free, but it was no use. The wires made their way to her elbow and biceps...they circled her arm and the ends pierced into her skin. Some of them caught her left hand, and continued to expand like a parasite.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran&rsquo;s free hand reached around Faith&rsquo;s back he lowered her torso and kissed her lips. Faith moaned while her eyes widened with shock. &ldquo;Mmmmmm!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Not only were her lips being violated, but it&rsquo;s even more humiliating to be in this position. She could do nothing but moan as Saran had his way with her. To him, this is just a game and her body is his toy.</p></p>

<p><p>Finally he released her lips and pulled her upright. He turned her around so her back was facing him. Her arms were tied up to her chest. He smelled her hair and she turned away in disgust.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Is this all you can do?&rdquo; he whispered into her ear. She could feel his breath on her ear and even this was uncomfortable. Both his words and his breath felt creepy and gross. He started to kiss her neck and shoulder. He pressed his lips on her skin gently, and his nose was touching her and smelling her skin at the same time. &ldquo;Surely you can do better than this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>His hands reached around the front to her breasts and squeezed them over the towel, causing her to moan. &ldquo;Ugh...ahhh...ugh...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Saran continued to kiss her shoulder as he squeezed her breasts harder. They were so soft and bouncy and he could do this all day. She smelled good and her skin tasted good to his lips. He could not get enough of this...beating and torturing this poor woman is the ultimate sexual high. This is not even a fight, but a sick game that he&rsquo;s playing to satisfy his own desires.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, the wires released her arms and he and shoved her in the back, causing her to stumble against the same wall.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was sprawled against the wall, panting for breath and recovering from being molested sexually. Her situation has not changed at all, but it was gradually get worse because she was even more tired than before.</p></p>

<p><p>She turned around and witnessed Saran, who was snickering at her suffering. Her left hand instinctively covered her breasts while her right hand was pressed against the wall. The look on her face was like a helpless animal that&rsquo;s about to be slaughtered, the look of someone who has suffered too much and just wants it to end. Her eyes were full of fear and terror.</p></p>

<p><p>Despite all that, she still must fight. It&rsquo;s her only option so she had to try. After catching her breath, Faith charged and did a high kick. Saran side-stepped and held her leg with both hands. Having her leg caught means she was standing on one leg, and she was unable to move freely. She tried to budge, but her efforts were in vain. The wires began to circle her leg, it was the moment she was dreading. They pierced her skin and she groaned from the pain.</p></p>

<p><p>Still holding her leg with his hand, Saran&rsquo;s other hand held her lower back, lifting her off the floor. Now he has this woman in his arms, another dominating position he enjoyed. The wires came from below and tied up her body in various places, as well as piercing themselves into her skin.</p></p>

<p><p>She reacted to that with more noises. &ldquo;Uhhh...uhhh!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The wires were basically doing the lifting for him, so all he had to do was hold her steady. He lifted her back up, so her head would get closer to his. He kissed her lips and enjoyed it thoroughly...her lips tasted so sweet and wet, he kissed them at every opportunity. Her whole body was his toy...his sex toy.</p></p>

<p><p>Then he lifted her leg at an angle so that her ankle touched his cheek. He liked the feeling of a woman&rsquo;s ankle on his cheek...somehow it just feels right to have a woman&rsquo;s skin rubbing on his skin. Her ankle felt good to his cheek, and it felt good to be holding onto her lower leg with his hand. The part he was holding up was her calf, and it was soft and fragile. He pressed his lips against her ankle, kissed the top of her foot, then glided his lips to her shin and kissed it all over.</p></p>

<p><p>The poor woman could do nothing as she felt her leg being violated by this villain. &ldquo;Uhhh...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>When he got bored of playing with her leg, his wires lifted her up so that she was floating above Saran. She was helpless, dangling in the air. Then the wires zapped her, causing her to scream. Poor Faith can&rsquo;t catch a break. Not only was she being electrocuted, but her ki was being drained...whatever left of it anyway.</p></p>

<p><p>After what felt like forever, he finally stopped zapping her. The wires moved her body to the wall and her back hit the wall. *Thud* The wires slowly let her land on the floor. She was on her feet. The wires let her go, but she had no strength to stand, and she fell on her knees.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith panted for breath and forced herself to get back on her feet. Wires came out of the walls to lock her wrists and ankles. She was unable to move.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have some fun.&rdquo; Wires protruded out of his fingers, and they were not like the other wires. At the tip there was a glowing ball. The five wires crept their way towards her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No! Please!&rdquo; She shrieked as the wires came to her legs. The wires creep into her towel and she screamed while being violated.</p></p>

<p><p> Even if he&rsquo;s not using his bare hands, it&rsquo;s the same for him. The wires are an extension of himself, and whatever they feel, he feels. If they touch her skin, he feels her skin.</p></p>

<p><p>The wires violated her lady parts while she squirmed. &ldquo;Ughhh! Aaaaah!!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>More wires protrude from his body and make their way to her breasts, they went into the towel. She screamed at the top of her lungs...</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="e">Saran's Spaceship - 3 </span></p></center>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...please!&rdquo; Faith cried out, as the man stood in front of her with his arms crossed and snickering at her. She was laying on her butt, with one hand clenching the towel against her breasts.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He he he...&rdquo; Saran inched his way towards her, taking small steps. She crawled back at he came closer to her. He was really enjoying this cat and mouse game - the cat always plays with the mouse before he devours it. And he wants to toy around with her some more...in a very slow and painful way.</p></p>

<p><p>But for the prey, this was not some game, but a life and death situation. Each step he took closer towards her is one step closer to her demise. Wearing only a towel, she was mostly exposed. Not only was she practically naked, but her body was still damaged from earlier. Saran had damaged her body physical as well as sexually</p></p>

<p><p>Her eyes were shaking and her lips quivering. &ldquo;D-Don&rsquo;t come any closer...&rdquo; she murmured.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran took another step forward, and Faith gasped and crawled back some more. This man standing before her is not a man, but a demon, and she has experienced his true horror. It was an experience worse than hell itself. And she does not want to go through this hell again.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...please...&rdquo; she whimpered, her voice trembling.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran took a step forward, and she got scared and crawled some more. The wires protruding from his limbs dived to the floor and into the cracks. While focused on Saran, she did not notice wires coming out of the floor.</p></p>

<p><p>Some of those wires caught her <strong>right ankle</strong>, and when she felt it, she looked at her ankle and gasped and shrieked. Her right leg kicked the air violently, desperate to get her ankle free. She remembered being violated by those things earlier...and she did not want to go through that feeling again. The wires caught her left ankle, and at the same time, other wires caught her knee and thighs.</p></p>

<p><p>More of them came from her sides and caught her arms and shoulders, pulling her down. Now she was lying flat on the ground.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran chuckled some more, watching his creations do his work for him. In this whole torture session, he put in almost no effort as he can control those wires with his mind alone.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was struggled for her life, groaning in pain as the wires violated her. All her limbs were caught, and her chances of escaping were virtually none. More wires came out from the cracks of the floor near her leg. They pierced her thighs, causing her to scream.</p></p>

<p><p>Some wires wrapped themselves around her <strong>neck</strong>, forcing her head to be against the floor. Not only can she not move her head, but her neck was very uncomfortable. The neck is one of the softest and most delicate places on a person&rsquo;s body, and even applying the slightest pressure on it causes discomfort. But for Faith, it was way worse than that. The wires were tight and hard, pressing against her soft and delicate neck.</p></p>

<p><p>Despite being bound, her right hand tried to reach for her neck, and she pulled with all her might. She had trouble breathing and her neck was being crushed little by little. Even though she was being violated all over her body, her neck felt the worst, and her hand desperately reached for it, hoping to pull the wires away. But she had no strength left and her right hand was pulled to the side by the wires.</p></p>

<p><p>The wires continue to strangle the poor girl&rsquo;s neck and she just suffered, not being able to do a thing to stop it. &ldquo;Uhhh...&rdquo; She was no longer able to move her limbs or her head. The wires kept squeezing her delicate neck and breathing became difficult and her vision became blurry. She was already weak to begin but with her neck being crushed, she had no energy left to resist. &ldquo;Uhhh...&rdquo; She thought it was the end for her...</p></p>

<p><p>Saran walked over to the fallen woman. &ldquo;Is that all you got? What happened to all that spunkiness from before?&rdquo; He gave her a light kick in the thigh, causing her to moan a little.</p></p>

<p><p>More wires came out from the floor and they headed to the area between her legs. They went inside the towel, violating her <strong>lady parts</strong>. She groaned and screamed louder than before, her limbs thrashed about and her body convulsed. It was so painful and discomforting that her head titled backwards as he groaned. Then her head tossed left and right. &ldquo;Ughhhh! Ughhh! Uhhhh!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Even more wires came out and went for her breasts. They slipped into the towel and violated her breasts. Now she was being violated in multiple places at the same time and suffered even more. &ldquo;Ughhh! Uhhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Saran enjoyed torturing her but he grows bored easily. With his victim unable to move he could have his way with her right now. But he wanted to toy around with her some more. He made the wires lift her up <strong>into the air</strong>. She was nothing more than a puppet, unable to move of her own free will and at his complete mercy.</p></p>

<p><p>The wires flipped her over so her front was facing down. Then they dropped her on the floor. *Wham* She groaned.</p></p>

<p><p>She was bound to the floor again, this time face flat. She was barely conscious after all the torture, but still conscious enough to feel everything done to her. Her wrists, forearms and ankles were bound by the wires, restricting her movements.</p></p>

<p><p>As her eyes opened, her vision was blurry for a few seconds. She saw her right hand surrounded by those deadly wires. Some of them had injected themselves into her forearm and was sucking her energy. The wires were definitely alive...they were pulsating...and there were bumps that traveled throughout the wire&rsquo;s length. Those bumps were her energy, which all went back to Saran.</p></p>

<p><p>The villain was receiving her energy but such a small amount wasn&rsquo;t enough. He wanted more.</p></p>

<p><p>More wires came out from cracks on the floor and hit her calves. Others hit her <strong>hamstrings</strong> and the inside of her thighs. The tips pierced into her skin, causing much discomfort. &ldquo;Uhhhh... uhhhh...&rdquo; The poor girl doesn&rsquo;t even get a moment&rsquo;s rest.</p></p>

<p><p>The wires felt alive, each one having a mind of it&rsquo;s own, each one violating a different part of her body. To her, it felt like being violated by hundreds of different leeches at the same time. She&rsquo;s never felt this kind of torture before...it&rsquo;s barbaric and humiliating.</p></p>

<p><p>But for Saran, this is the best feeling ever. The wires are an extension of his body, so he feels everything they feel. It&rsquo;s no different if his bare hands was feeling the skin on her legs. He&rsquo;s sucked a lot of people&rsquo;s energy before, but there&rsquo;s nothing like a violating a woman&rsquo;s bare skin.</p></p>

<p><p>She thought it couldn&rsquo;t get worse...but she was wrong. A new group of wires crawled inside the towel...and violated her lady parts. She moaned louder. &ldquo;Uhhh! Uhhh!&rdquo; It was getting worse every second. It was extremely uncomfortable, but she was unable to move. &ldquo;Uhhh! Uhhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>More wires appeared from the cracks and hit her shoulders. &ldquo;Uhhh...&rdquo; More appeared and pierced her back, the part of her skin that was exposed.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran was enjoying this so much that his eyeballs disappeared for a brief moment. He felt the contents of her skin on her legs.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith continued to moan as she was bound, pierced and having her energy drained all at the same time. She was suffering so much she couldn&rsquo;t even think. She was just a lamb for the slaughter...her life was in someone else&rsquo;s hands.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran released more wires from his thighs, they sank into the cracks of the floor.</p></p>

<p><p> He bent down directly in front of her so he could look at her face.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it? That&rsquo;s all the resistance you can offer? How pathetic.&rdquo; He was mocking her and wanted to get her mad.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I thought you were a fighter. Are you just going to give up so easily? I guess you&rsquo;ll never see your beloved Tyson again.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She gasped and her eyes opened wide. Upon seeing a reaction, Saran knew he was on the ball. Saran stood up and Faith&rsquo;s head faced forward to look at him. &ldquo;Tyson...he&rsquo;ll come for me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so sure of that?&rdquo; He crossed his arms. &ldquo;But when he does, that&rsquo;ll be the end of him. I&rsquo;ll make sure you never see him again.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Her face was facing forward, lifting her chin inches off the floor.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Actually, I have a better idea. I&rsquo;m going to capture him and torture him in front of you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What you&rsquo;re going through now is nothing compared to what I&rsquo;m going to do to him.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Saran&rsquo;s smirk grew even more sinister. He is a sick and demented individual who likes to torture others and provoke them. When his victims get mad it makes him happy. And when the victim is a woman, it turns him on. He liked torturing and violating this woman, but to make her <strong>mad</strong> while torturing her is a thrill for him, a sexual high like no other.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to cut off all his fingers so he can never fight again!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No please!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha! What else should I cut off next? How about his toes?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What else should I do? I know, how about I make him blind?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No please!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hahahaha!&rdquo; He can feel it...she was a helpless lamb but eventually she&rsquo;ll get angry and offer some resistance. &ldquo;The only question is...in which order should I do those things?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Why...ugh.&rdquo; The pain was too much and her face landed on the floor.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s not something you would understand. I enjoy torturing people.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a monster...&rdquo; she uttered in a weak voice.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you do something about it? No, I guess this is all you&rsquo;ve got, huh?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith stared at her left arm, surrounded by loops of glowing wires. Some of them have pierced into her and entered her muscles. She cursed at her own powerlessness. Tyson would never give up and if he was here that&rsquo;s exactly what he would say. The only time to give up is when you&rsquo;re dead. She tried to make a fist, clenching four fingers together with the thumb on top. She was able to control her own body, or at least her fist, and it&rsquo;s a start...if she&rsquo;s still alive she can fight back.</p></p>

<p><p>She grunted as she used up all her willpower to keep her fist tight. She looked at her right arm and made a fist. Then she put her palms on the floor and tried to lift her torso off the floor. It was a difficult task and she grunted constantly. Her body was drained and was still bound by the wires. &ldquo;Ughh. Ughh.&rdquo; But she was persistent and inch by inch, she got on her elbows.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran noticed she was making progress and continued the taunts. &ldquo;Oh well you&rsquo;re better off with me than that worthless sayan. I bet you&rsquo;re enjoying this as much as I am, aren&rsquo;t ya?&rdquo; He said with a smirk on his face.</p></p>

<p><p>His words made her angry. While she laid on her elbows she focused on her legs. She made them move, resisting the wires. Somehow she managed to be on her elbows and knees. Her forehead was touching the floor and all she could see was the floor. She panted heavily. *Sigh sigh*</p></p>

<p><p>The villain was happy she made progress. Her anger is making her move and soon she&rsquo;ll be able to provide him with even more life energy. Saran enjoyed every part of this show. It was entertaining to watch this woman struggle to do something as trivial like as standing up. Her struggling is titillating to him...the heavy breathing, the grunting noises, it is all part of the experience. And of course, the best part is that she is wearing only a towel. (Yes...give me more enjoyment! Don&rsquo;t disappoint me now!)</p></p>

<p><p>Unable to control himself, he sent more wires into the floor, and they hit her calves, making her moan. But she was determined to stand up no matter what and endured the pain. Her head faced up to look at the villain. She breathed heavily while staring at him with eyes full of anger.</p></p>

<p><p>(Yes! That look is nice too!)</p></p>

<p><p>More wires protruded out of his groin area and they came out the area between her legs...and they entered the towel to violate her lady parts. She groaned and fell flat on the floor. Even thought she was back at square one, she was still determined. She grunted and panted for breath and got back on her knees and elbows much faster than the first time.</p></p>

<p><p>She grunted so hard that her eyes appeared to be shut. She pulled her arms from the floor but the wires were strapped to the floor, it was like pulling against rubber bands. Faith&rsquo;s arms were trapped but she managed to get her torso off the floor, resulting in a child-pose. She kept pulling her arms with all her might, grunting heavily and sweating. With pure determination she was able to get her arms off the ground, dragging the wires with them, and now she was a in a kneeling position.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha!&rdquo; He was enjoying this very much. &ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;re good for...to be my slave...forever.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith ripped the wires off her forearms. *Snap snap snap* It hurt to rip them off because they were embedded deep into her muscles. Some of them remained on her forearms and upper arms but they were no longer enough to restrain her. She planted her left foot on the floor, so that she was on one knee.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you become my woman? I already know you inside and out. Hah ha haha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nearly every thing she did made him aroused. This position is a good one too...</p></p>

<p><p> Saran sent more wires to her - but only a little bit. He made sure not to send to much or she might pass out. It&rsquo;s enough to keep things interesting.</p></p>

<p><p>Wires hit her left thigh and other parts of her leg, and she moaned. &ldquo;Ughh! Ugh!&rdquo; She moaned with one eye closed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll pay for this...&rdquo; She ripped the wires off her leg and grunted because it hurt to pull them out of her skin.</p></p>

<p><p>She lifted her right leg while pushing her palms off the floor. Her body was trembling and she was exhausted and this proved to be the most difficult task yet. She fell on her right knee. Driven by anger, she was still determined to stand up...she&rsquo;s made it this far and she&rsquo;s not about to give up now.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ohh?&rdquo; Saran exclaimed.</p></p>

<p><p>Somehow, her palms with off the floor and planted both feet down. Her knees were bent and touching each other. It was difficult to get any further since the wires were pulling her limbs down. She struggled harder, doing much grunting and panting and made her legs straighter and straighter.</p></p>

<p><p>Finally, she stood up straight and her fingers curled into a fist.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran smirked. &ldquo;Yesss....that&rsquo;s it...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>With her knees slightly bent and her fists curled, she was in a power up stance.</p></p>

<p><p>she was in power up stance. Electricity appeared around her body.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Saran blurred and appeared behind her, causing her to gasp. He wrapped his arms around hers and rested his hands on her breasts. &ldquo;Let go!&rdquo; she exclaimed. With his face directly in her hair, he smelled her hair and sighed, while his hands squeezed her breasts hard. &ldquo;Stop it! Stop! Ughhh! Uhhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> New wires appeared on the floor, they sprouted like grass and they pierced her legs. They immediately started sucking her energy.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Uuuuugh!&rdquo; Once again, she was violated in several places at the same time. While the wires drained her life, Saran was squeezing her breasts, not stopping even for a second.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Stop it! Stop...ughhhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>His face was in her cheek, and she turned away in disgust. He started kissing the side of her neck, then moved his lips down to her shoulder. He took it slow, he wanted to enjoy every kiss and touch to its fullest.</p></p>

<p><p>For Saran, this was the high he was looking for. Torturing a woman who doesn&rsquo;t offer resistance is no fun at all. His strategy was to make her angry so she can fight back...just so he can take her down again. Not only that, but when she fights back, she has more energy that he can absorb...which adds even more excitement to the high. For him, this is better than taking drugs. There&rsquo;s so much stimulus for him...absorbing this woman&rsquo;s energy while violating her sexually...and her moans and pleas for mercy make it even better. This is one of the joys of his life.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh...ahhh...uhhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> She moaned as Saran continued to kiss her neck and shoulder. All that anger and determination she felt a moment ago was gone in an instant. She was back to being that helpless victim...a naked woman who can only moan as she was being tortured...that&rsquo;s all she can do now.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;P-please...stop...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Saran had manipulated the situation so that this would happen. He tortured her, then made her angry so she can resist, only to torture her again. She never stood a chance to begin with.</p></p>

<p><p>Then he lowered her torso diagonally and they were face to face.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please...no...&rdquo; she whimpered, her eyes shaking from fear. She realized there&rsquo;s no way she can win against him.</p></p>

<p><p>He kept kissing her shoulder and her neck while she moaned helplessly. Then he lowered her torso diagonally and they were face to face.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please...no...&rdquo; she whimpered, her eyes shaking from fear.</p></p>

<p><p>He leaned in and kissed her lips. &ldquo;Mmmfffff!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>No longer able to hold back the tears, the tears streamed down her cheeks. Saran was waiting for this moment the entire time, and he was going to make it last as long as he can. Her lips were so soft and sweet, he had no intention of stopping it anytime soon. As he got more turned on, more wires protruded out of his back and into the ground. Hundreds of wires out of the ground and attached themselves to her legs, and soon, her whole body...causing her to moan even more. &ldquo;MMMMFFFFFF!!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>No one but these two knew what happened after that...but within his ship, one can hear a woman&rsquo;s screams...repeated over and over. Those were not regular screams...but the screams of someone who has all their life energy drained while being violated sexually...the screams of someone who suffers a fate worse than death.</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="f">Tyson Wakes Up </span></p></center>

<p><p>Tyson woke up with a huge headache. He was in a big gray room with a view of outer space. Having no idea where he was, it took him a few moments to realize that he&rsquo;s in a spaceship of some sort.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; He groaned when he felt pain in his body. He was topless and <strong>wrapped in bandages</strong>. The bandages on his chest have bloodstains on it, and there were bandages on his head as well. He was wearing the ripped up pants he had before, and there were bandages under those pants.</p></p>

<p><p>The automatic doors opened and Zelfire strolled in, holding a tray of space food. &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re awake.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh. Where am I?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire set the tray down on the table. &ldquo;Where do you think? We&rsquo;re in a Galactic Police station in space.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You brought me here?&rdquo; Tyson asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Your brother brought you here. You&rsquo;re a heavy guy, ya know?&rdquo; Zelfire waited for a reaction, but Tyson merely stared at the floor with a sad look on his face. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Faith isn&rsquo;t here. I lost her...again! She was taken right before my eyes. Ugh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Listen Tyson, you need some rest.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, I have to get her back...ugh!&rdquo; The pain struck his chest, and he sat back down.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What can you do in your condition? If will do you no good if you act rashly.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Damn...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p></p></p>

<p><p>The prisoners who are arrested by the Galactic Police are sent to stationed prisons across different planets. But there is a special prison located in space for the most dangerous criminals that have been caught. It is much harder for them to escape since it&rsquo;s in space. This is the place where criminals like Blue was being kept.</p></p>

<p><p>A guard walked down the hallway slowly and mindlessly like a zombie. It is not wrong to say he is mindless, since his mind was being controlled by another from nearby.</p></p>

<p><p>In the control room, the chair turned around by itself...or at least that&rsquo;s what it seems like. A person appeared on the chair. He was a green-skinned creature with pointy ears, resembling a goblin. He donned a full body suit, just like everyone in the Assassin Squad. But on his head was an electronic helmet with multi-colored lights flashing randomly.</p></p>

<p><p><strong>Groggy</strong> is a master of mind control, a rare skill that cannot be taught. When he uses his mind control, the lights on his helmet flash like crazy, more so when he concentrates harder. He too can turn invisible, and he&rsquo;s not a fighter type, so he&rsquo;s more stealthy than the other assassins. His skills make him perfect for sabotage and intruder missions like this one.</p></p>

<p><p>The guard, being controlled by Groggy, walked to Blue&rsquo;s cell. He used his key card to open the door.</p></p>

<p><p>The inside of the cell was covered in complete darkness. <strong>Blue</strong> was wearing a black full body suit, so he was nearly invisible in the darkness. Only his face was partially seen. When the metallic door opened, he saw light for the first time in a while, and he winced. &ldquo;Ugh...what is now, officer?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The guard did not reply, but stared blankly at the wall. Blue knew something was up. The guard unlocked Blue&rsquo;s handcuffs. *Click* The handcuffs dropped on the floor. Blue stood up and shook his wrists a little. &ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;These are Saran&rsquo;s orders.&rdquo; said the guard.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue&rsquo;s eyes opened wide upon hearing that name. &ldquo;I see. So he&rsquo;s in charge now.&rdquo; He punched the guard in the stomach with an electric charged fist. It has the same effect as a tazer, so the guard was knocked out instantly.</p></p>

<p><p>A police officer barged into Angela&rsquo;s room. He whispered something into her ear. &ldquo;What!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Blue escaped from prison? How did this happen?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Our security cameras caught it. Please come to the video room.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They went to the video room and saw footage of Blue escaping from his cell, and knocking out a few officers after that. &ldquo;How did he escape?&rdquo; Angela asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;One of us helped free him from his cell. He&rsquo;s being interrogated right now. But the thing is...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They were watching the interrogation on the monitor. One of the officers was hounding the prison guard for answers. The interrogator slammed his fist on the desk.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Why did you let Blue escape? Who are you working for?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember a thing. I just blanked out...&rdquo; The prison guard was staring at the floor, his eyes shaking and his voice quivering.</p></p>

<p><p>The interrogator pointed his index finger angrily at the guy&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;You expect me to believe that bullshit?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The prison guard looked up. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s the truth! When I woke up I was already on the floor...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;As you can see, commander, the guard claims he doesn&rsquo;t remember anything.&rdquo; said the officer.</p></p>

<p><p>Angela often bites her thumb when she&rsquo;s thinking hard. &ldquo;How can that be?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve tried all kinds of methods, but it looks like his memory is not returning. It may be amnesia.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s more like mind control than amnesia.&rdquo; Angela replied.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;<strong>Mind control</strong>?&rdquo; repeated the officer.</p></p>

<p><p>Angela continued to bite her thumb. &ldquo;Although it&rsquo;s not confirmed...Rumors have it that someone in the Assassin Squad has the ability to mind control others...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No way...are you saying that an assassin can do that? And he&rsquo;s the one who controlled one of our own guys?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only logical explanation. You might as well stop the interrogation. His memories won&rsquo;t come back.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The heroes have gathered in the medical room, the same room where Tyson woke up after his near-death experience. Tyson, who was still bummed out, sat there on the bed, still shirtless with his bandages. Nebula was facing the window, staring at outer space.</p></p>

<p><p>The automatic door slid open and Angela came in. &ldquo;Guys.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula turned around. &ldquo;Angela? Why did you call us here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Angela: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for the short notice. I brought you here to the Galactic Police station for your safety. You&rsquo;ve had a few battles with the Assassin Squad and now they know who you are. All of you, especially Tyson, are in danger.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire: &ldquo;So you think we&rsquo;ll be safer here, guarded by the Galactic Police.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Angela: &ldquo;No where is safe from them...not after what I discovered.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mac: &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;One of their assassins was able to infiltrate our prison base in space, he helped Blue escape. It&rsquo;s likely he used mind control, although I can&rsquo;t prove it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Everyone gasped. &ldquo;Mind control?&rdquo; Nebula repeated. &ldquo;This is ridiculous. First, they can turn invisible...then a guy who copies our moves, a guy who freezes everything, and now this? When will this madness end?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Angela: &ldquo;This just shows you how dangerous this group is. I suspect their benefactor is someone who has a lot of political and financial power. In any case, I just came here to tell you guys to be careful of mind control.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;How are we supposed to defend ourselves from that?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Angela replied. &ldquo;I have people looking into it now. Be careful.&rdquo; She left the room.</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire: &ldquo;There is a way to prevent your mind from being controlled.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mac: &ldquo;Yea? What is it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire: &ldquo;It is to train your mind and make it strong. A strong and calm mind will be impervious to hypnosis and other mind tricks. I will teach you all about mind control.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>After putting on his body suit, Blue entered the control room and saw two familiar faces waiting for him. &ldquo;Spidey, long time no see. You&rsquo;re as...ugly as usual.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh same to you, Blue.&rdquo; Spidey replied.</p></p>

<p><p>Then he and Azure locked eyes. These two have a history of rivalry, well known within the squad. They have never liked each other since the beginning.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue: &ldquo;Oh. Azure...I never expected to see you here. What&rsquo;s the matter, is the sun too hot for you so you have to hide in space?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Azure said: &ldquo;Hmph. Why would Saran waste his time on a failure like you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Blue&rsquo;s eyes twitched from being annoyed. &ldquo;Oh? Look who&rsquo;s talking. Who was defeated by a weakling?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Azure is usually calm, but he got mad. &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Blue: &ldquo;Hmm. I did not come here for you. Where is Saran?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Azure: &ldquo;Saran only appears when he wishes. He will not show up just because you want him to.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Grrr. I demand to know where he is. Why did he summon me here just to make me wait? That&rsquo;s rude!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Saran appeared behind him. &ldquo;Did you call for me?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Blue, who is himself a master of stealth, did not sense him at all. The fact that someone was able to sneak behind him gave him the chills. He knows that Saran is not someone simple at all. A drop of sweat dripped down his face.</p></p>

<p><p>He turned around and calmly asked: &ldquo;Why did you bring me here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Saran: &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it obvious? I want you to join my team.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Blue: &ldquo;You mean...have me take orders from you? I report to Indigo only.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Saran: &ldquo;Indigo is dead. I&rsquo;m the next in the chain of command. That means you report to me now.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Blue: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a commander too!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Saran smirked. &ldquo;Not anymore. You were defeated by that sayan and even got yourself captured by the Galactic Police. How pathetic is that?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Grrrr. If I had another chance, I&rsquo;ll beat him, you&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve dealt with that pesky sayan already. He&rsquo;s no big deal. You owe me for getting you out of prison.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask for your help. If anyone should be the leader, it should be me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ohh? You think you have what it takes to challenge me?&rdquo; Saran shrugged. &ldquo;Fine. Show me what you can do.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You asked for it!&rdquo; Blue clenched his fist and charged it with <strong>electricity</strong>. He threw a punch forward and Saran grabbed his fist. *Thud* He squeezed his fist for three seconds, and then the wires start coming out of his forearm.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue saw them and started to freak out, pulling his fist away. The <strong>wires</strong> wrapped themselves around Blue&rsquo;s hand and wrist, and he groaned in pain. &ldquo;Ughhh...&rdquo; Blue used his free to grab Saran&rsquo;s hand. Saran used his free hand to grab Blue&rsquo;s neck and shove him against the wall.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran may be of average build, but his arms are surprising muscular, and he can lift Blue off the ground with only one hand. Blue groaned in pain as his neck was being crushed. &ldquo;Ughh!! Uhhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Azure and Spidey watched with wide open eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue&rsquo;s neck was losing its strength and he couldn&rsquo;t breath. &ldquo;A-Alright...I concede.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Saran proceeded to let him go, and Blue coughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we came to an understanding.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>After Blue regained his composure, he had more questions. &ldquo;So...who was it that freed me?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Saran smiled. &ldquo;You have Groggy to thank for that.&rdquo; He snapped his fingers.</p></p>

<p><p>Groggy appeared, sitting on the computer panel. &ldquo;Heh heh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Blue was shocked. &ldquo;He was there the whole time? I did not sense him at all.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What a freak!&rdquo; said Spidey.</p></p>

<p><p>Groggy got into Spidey&rsquo;s face and grunted. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;re ya calling a freak, ya freak?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You, who else?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They both grunted angrily at each other&rsquo;s faces.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran was annoyed at their yelling. &ldquo;Shut up! We have better things to do than fight each other.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Azure: &ldquo;So now that the team is assembled, what&rsquo;s our next mission?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Blue: &ldquo;Is it to kill the sayan named Spade?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Saran: &ldquo;Our benefactor no longer considers Spade a threat. We have much bigger fish to fry than some stupid sayan. This time, we are going straight for the top...our target is Jerrell Florencia.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey gasped. &ldquo;Jerrell...as in the headmaster of the Galactic Police forces...that Jerrell?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Saran smirked. &ldquo;We have received a large some of money for our mission. Our benefactor considers Jerrell an eyesore. With Groggy&rsquo;s hypnosis and mind control, it&rsquo;s possible to take him out.&rdquo;</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="g">Become One with him </span></p></center>

<p><p>With one hand clenching the towel against her bosom, Faith retreated as Saran inched his way to her. Paralyzed by fear, she was unable to move any further and just remained frozen like a deer in headlights.</p></p>

<p><p>He did resemble a man, but rather a demon with a man&rsquo;s face. Every part of him was a demon - his black full body suit, the tentacles protruding out of his suit...and even the evil smirk on his face resembled a demon. It would be no different if he had red eyes and a grinning mouth that reached the full width of his face.</p></p>

<p><p>She watched in horror as more and more wires came out of him. At first they came out of his back and went towards her in a circular path. Then wires came out of all his limbs, all heading for the same target - which is Faith. Her eyes were shaking and her hands trembling. Her lips parted and she had difficulty breathing.</p></p>

<p><p>The amount of wires coming out seemed endless, as if he can produce an infinite amount of wires, the same wires that cause her great suffering. After being violated so many times, she knew what was coming...the wires torture her in several ways. They can pierce her skin and drain her life force. They can also tie her up and cause much discomfort. And once bound, they can pin her against the wall, the floor, and the ceiling, and toss her around like a ragged doll. And they can violate the difference orifices in her body, causing much pain. But knowing that, she was still unable to move her feet.</p></p>

<p><p>All the wires converged at a single area - which is directly in front of her. Some of them were mere inches away from her eyes. &ldquo;N-no...&rdquo; she murmured in a barely audible voice.</p></p>

<p><p>Little did she know, Saran had wires protruded into his feet that sank into the crevices of the floor and they headed towards her. Ten of them reached her side and pierced her skin. Some pierced her ankles and some pierced her calf. The pain was sudden and surprising and she gasped. Her hands dropped to the side...and with nothing holding onto the loose towel, it slipped off her breasts and dropped on the floor. *Plop* Now she stood before him butt naked.</p></p>

<p><p>The situation was grim to begin with, but now, without anything covering her body, this situation has become one of complete dominance. Saran didn&rsquo;t have to lift a finger yet - literally. His eyes lit up and a wicked smile came upon his lips as he stared at her bare body. He walked towards her while she remained like a deer in headlights.</p></p>

<p><p>Now, they stood face to face. Faith was staring directly into the eyes of the devil. &ldquo;Become one with me...&rdquo; He placed his hands on her upper arms and leaned in to kiss her lips.</p></p>

<p><p><strong>&ldquo;Mmmmm!!&rdquo;</strong> she moaned. Her arms still would not respond, as well as her entire body. It&rsquo;s as if her nervous system was shut down, and could only watch herself being violated.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran&rsquo;s hand reached for her lower back, pushing her torso closer to his and making the kiss better for him. Like always, he doesn&rsquo;t just smack the lips, he completely swallows them, just as a demon devours it&rsquo;s prey. Tears drip from her eyes and run down her cheeks.</p></p>

<p><p>As he grew more turned on, he kept leaning into her, forcing her head to tilt back. But his arms held her lower back so she doesn&rsquo;t fall down. Wires from his arms injected themselves into her back, causing her more pain. She was being violated in multiple places at once.</p></p>

<p><p>Then his right hand moved down to her butt cheek and he squeezed it hard. He believes that this woman&rsquo;s body, mind and soul all belong to him, and it showed in how he squeezed her cheek. Wires start to inject into her cheek.</p></p>

<p><p>Then he grabbed her thigh and raised her left leg against his hips. Still having control over her lower back, he lowered her body at an angle.</p></p>

<p><p>His lips were still glued to hers while this was happening. He did not bother breathing, he just wanted to taste this woman&rsquo;s lips every second and not let go. He wanted to taste those lips all day.</p></p>

<p><p>His forearm wires surrounded her thigh with loops, while shorter wires injected themselves into her flesh. Some wires tied up her arms to her stomach.</p></p>

<p><p>As various parts of her naked body were violated, she moaned more with wide open eyes. But she couldn&rsquo;t scream because of the lip lock. &ldquo;<strong>Mmmmm...Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!&rdquo;</strong></p></p>

<p><p>As Saran became more aroused, he forced her body lower and lower. her right leg was standing straight, but not for long. he finally released her lips to take a breath. He guided his face down her neck and towards her clavicle. he kissed her clavicle as his nose was hitting her neck. Her head was completely upside down now.</p></p>

<p><p> They lost balance and fell down, with Saran being on top. *Thud* Luckily for him, he landed on Faith&rsquo;s soft body so he barely felt a thing. Faith on the other hand, had to land on the hard floor with a man on top of her. Now, Saran was in a perfect position to violate her to his heart&rsquo;s content. He put his face into her breasts and let himself loose, enjoying the taste and scent of her skin. Faith was finally able to move, but it was too late, for she was in a position where she was completely dominated physically. Her head tossed and turned while she moaned from the discomfort. Her arms flailed about. Their legs were intertwined with his legs and they thrashed about and her feet kicked the floor.</p></p>

<p><p>The wires already on her was sucking her life energy while Saran violated her. But the worst has yet to come. The endless number of wires kept growing out of his suit from head to toe...and all of them violated the poor girl.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ahhhhh! Ahhhhh!&rdquo; Faith has never experienced such hell before in her life, not in her worst nightmares could she conjure up a situation like this. Having a man on top of her and having his way with her was bad enough, but that was the least of her problems. The wires made loops around her arms and squeezed her arm tightly, while others injected themselves into her flesh to suck her energy. And this was happening to her from head to toe. No one can count how exactly how many places she was being violated at once...it was everywhere. She screamed at the top of her lungs. &ldquo;AAAAH! AAAAH!&rdquo; She could no longer hold back the tears...a river of tears streamed down her eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>Every second that passed by was sheer torture and she came closer and closer to her demise. Wires protruded endlessly out of Saran&rsquo;s entire body to violate the poor girl. His wires made loops around her <strong>forearm</strong>, making their way down to her <strong>wrists</strong>. Her arms flailed about but that did not slow the wires down at all. Her upper arm had several loops in the middle, and it was spreading to her shoulder.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;AAAAAAH! PLEASE STOP! PLEASE PLEASE!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> Wires from his chest went directly to her <strong>breasts</strong>, injecting themselves into her skin. Others went around to her back to make sure all of her skin was covered. The loops around her breasts became larger, slowly but surely making their way up to her sternum.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;PLEASE! STOP! AAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAH!&rdquo; Faith&rsquo;s head tossed and turned violently. All she could see was the gray ceiling above her. And soon, her vision would become blurry because of her tears. All she saw was a distortion of the ceiling and all she could hear was her own screaming.</p></p>

<p><p>She screamed at the top of her lungs. It was probably the most she has ever screamed in her life. Even though her throat was getting sore, she still screamed and pleaded...it was all she could do. In evolution, a woman&rsquo;s scream is loud high pitched. to warn others of danger. It is also a cry for help. A man that hears a woman scream is compelled to find the source of the noise and help the woman being attacked. But her screams fell on deaf ears. Only Saran hears her...and he enjoyed her screams. No one is coming to save her.</p></p>

<p><p>Loops of wires have her <strong>upper thigh</strong> and they were making their way down to her knee. Another group has her shin and calf...and they were making their way to her heel. While all this was happening, wires injected themselves into her lady parts. Loops appeared around her hips and began to spread to her stomach and thigh.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;AAAAAH! AAAAAAH! UHHHH!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Her left arm was mostly covered, only small slices of her skin were visible. The wires have made their way to her hand and her fingers. Her shoulders were completely bound and the wires start to wrap themselves around her neck.</p></p>

<p><p>No words could even begin to describe her suffering. . No one can count how exactly how many places she was being violated at once...it was everywhere. This has to be the single most painful torture she has ever experienced and will ever experience. Right now, she could barely feel Saran&rsquo;s body violating her. In fact, she was in so much pain that she would rather be violated by a man...anything is better than enduring this.</p></p>

<p><p>As her energy was being drained, her movements became less and less violent...her limbs moved slower with each passing second. Even her screams were becoming weaker.</p></p>

<p><p>The wires have most of her legs. Only the heel and toes remain untouched - but not for long.</p></p>

<p><p>Her <strong>left arm</strong> reached for the ceiling. It was completely covered by wires except the tip of the fingers. She reached with the last of her strength. The wires completely tied up her fingers and her arm dropped to the floor.</p></p>

<p><p>Soon, her toes and heel were covered. The entire bottom half of her body was covered, as well as the top half. All that remains was her head.</p></p>

<p><p>The wires covered her nose. She became more scared. &ldquo;AAAAAAAH!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Wires covered her forehead and it looked like she was wearing a headband.</p></p>

<p><p>Wires that glow at the tip went into her mouth. &ldquo;MMMMFFF!&rdquo; Soon, her mouth was sealed shut.</p></p>

<p><p>Then, one of her eyes was covered, taking out half her vision. She had only one eye left. &ldquo;MMMFFF!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> Wires covered her eye...and all that remains was total darkness.</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="h">Mind Training 1 </span></p></center>

<p><p>Within the Galactic Police station, the heroes were given their own room to live in, this one had a view of space from a wall-sized window. They sat on the floor in lotus position, with Tyson, Nebula, and Macintosh facing Zelfire. He instructed them to close their eyes and concentrate on clearing their minds. Within minutes of meditation, they have successfully entered the spirit world.</p></p>

<p><p>As always, the environment of the spirit world is nothing but a barren wasteland, full of uncolored mountains and the calm sky.</p></p>

<p><p>Zell: &ldquo;Alright. I will take on Macintosh, Tyson and Nebula you take on each other.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; replied everyone.</p></p>

<p><p>Everyone blurred out of sight.</p></p>

<p><p>Zell and Mac appeared in front of each other. They wasted no time with staring and charged into each other to exchange blows. Zell kicked him in the stomach, knocking him away. Mac stuck his hand into the ground to stop his body from moving. *Scrrrrrrr*</p></p>

<p><p>Zell got into fighting stance. Mac fired the Electro-shockwave and Zell blurred, appearing further away. Mac fired again, Zell blurred and appeared further away. Mac fired a third time, and Zell once again blurred and appeared in the sky.</p></p>

<p><p>Mac jumped up and pointed his palms down, and fired ki blasts to boost himself forward. *Froom* He became faster than a speeding bullet. Mac intended to use his own body to hit his opponent. Zell dodged to the side and grabbed Mac&rsquo;s arm, and swings him several times and then let go. *Whoosh* Mac&rsquo;s body crashed into a pillar. *Crash*</p></p>

<p><p>Zell looked up to see Tyke and Neb sparring above him.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson and and Nebula exchanged blows at close range. Then they move away from each other.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Go ahead, transform into a super sayan or whatever.&rdquo; said Nebula.<br>  &rdquo;This is the Spirit World, transformations don&rsquo;t matter. I can give you all I&rsquo;ve got in any form.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So this is the best you&rsquo;ve got?&rdquo;<br>  &rdquo;Not by a long shot.&rdquo; Tyson powered up.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talking about!&rdquo; Nebula powered up.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson became a blue sphere and Nebula became a purple sphere and they slammed into each other. They flew in circles and repeating patterns of hitting each and then distancing themselves. *Wham wham wham*</p></p>

<p><p>Both of them fired beams non-stop from their palms without caring about aiming and explosions were abound. Some of the stray beams hit the mountains, and some of them flew Zelfire.</p></p>

<p><p>Mac came out from the rubble and stood up, the dust falling off his clothes. He wiped the blood off his mouth and he looks ready for another round. He powered up and flew to Zelfire&rsquo;s altitude.</p></p>

<p><p>Mac charged forward and let out a combo of punches while Zell dodged robotically. Mac did a hook and Zell ducked and saw an opening and punched him in the ribs. Mac floated backwards. Zell charged and they hit on the forearms. *Wham* They were even in power and push each other back and forth, grunting and screaming at the top of their lungs.</p></p>

<p><p>As soon as they broke free of their power struggle, Mac threw a punch and Zell instinctively blocked. Mac&rsquo;s electricity zapped Zell&rsquo;s hand, causing him to let go and scream. Mac did a flying side kick to his chest. *Wham* Zell&rsquo;s hand was over his wound and he groaned in pain.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Alright, that&rsquo;s enough.&rdquo; Zelfire powered down and landed on the ground level. Everyone else landed as well. &ldquo;All I can say is...you are not ready for the upcoming fight.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Everyone was displeased by what he said, especially Nebula, the ever impatient one.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Nebula,&rdquo; said Zell. &ldquo;Your weakness is that you&rsquo;re too impulsive. You have to stop and think before you act.&rdquo; Then he turned to Mac. &ldquo;Macintosh. Your ki is too weak and you need to increase it substantially.&rdquo; Finally, he turned to Tyke. &ldquo;Tyson. You&rsquo;re too focused on saving Faith. You&rsquo;re angry and you act irrationally.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>No one could object to his harsh words, since he spoke the truth. Tyson spoke up. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take a break.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zell nodded in agreement, and everyone left the spirit world.</p></p>

<p><p> Back in the real world, Tyson was staring at space through the life sized window. Zelfire came in to talk to him.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson can see Zell&rsquo;s reflection on the window and didn&rsquo;t bother turning around. &ldquo;Angela said there&rsquo;s an assassin who can use mind control. That is some scary stuff. It makes wonder...will it work on a super sayan?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if it will work on a super sayan, I don&rsquo;t know much about the super sayan state. But what I do know is Saran and his kind. He never plays fair and will use your emotions against you. He will make you angry just to provoke you, which makes you impulsive and that makes you an easy target.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Then...what do you suggest?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I will train your mind...so you won&rsquo;t fall prey to his tricks. Then you can save Faith. Remember, impatience won&rsquo;t amount to anything.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson had a flashback of Saran torturing Faith in front of him. Zell was right. Saran is a coward who never plays fair. Not only that, but his strength rivals Blue&rsquo;s strength, no, he&rsquo;s even stronger than Blue. He will not be an easy opponent to deal with.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to be patient. It won&rsquo;t be easy.&rdquo; Tyson replied quietly.</p></p>

<p><p>With that said, Zelfire left the room.</p></p>

<p><p>Mind Training 2</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula just finished taking a shower and he came to the chambers in his pajamas. He was hungry and went straight to the fridge. He pulled out a plastic container that contained different colored food. But it was all in the form of jello. &ldquo;Ugh...space food is gross. It has no taste whatsoever.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The door opened and Tyson came in. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t sleep either huh?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you can eat this crap.&rdquo; Neb said, pointing to his food container.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You know I eat just about anything.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Beggars can&rsquo;t be choosers, I suppose.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s train in the spirit world.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Good idea.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>So Nebula and Tyson sat across each other in lotus position. Once their minds were synchronized, they entered the Spirit World. This time, it was a wasteland full of pointy shaped cones. Tyson and Nebula started off in different spots and they have to find each other without exposing themselves.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson dashed between the cones as silently as he could. He has no idea if the opponent can hear him, but it&rsquo;s good enough if he doesn&rsquo;t hear his own footsteps. Suddenly, he stopped and hid behind one of the cones. He suppressed his ki until it was non-existent, and Nebula did the same, since Tyson cannot sense him at all. His sixth sense was of no use right now, so he had to rely on his other senses.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula was going through the exact same thing. He dashed quietly towards the center, a little bit at a time.</p></p>

<p><p>Both fighters stopped moving and there was nothing but silence in the entire world. A drop of sweat ran down Tyson&rsquo;s face. The tension was high. At first, sparring excited him, but now, it&rsquo;s different. Not knowing where the enemy is bad. But not knowing if the enemy knows where you are is absolutely dreadful.</p></p>

<p><p>Little did they know, they were only two cones away from each other. Tyson closed his eyes and tried to think about Zelfire&rsquo;s training. If your sixth sense can&rsquo;t be relied upon, you have to use everything else at your disposal. The rocks, the air, the insects, anything at all.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson&rsquo;s eyes opened. He knew where Nebula was, and likewise, Nebula knew where he was. It wasn&rsquo;t the sixth sense, he was able to sense a living creature nearby. Suddenly, they both jumped up and fired a ki blast. *Bam* They both missed, causing two explosions behind them.</p></p>

<p><p>They floated to the sky, continuing their barrage of ki blasts. Then they charged into each other and hit really hard. This is the part that Tyson is familiar with, and Nebula felt the same. Exchanging blows feels natural, and they were both at ease, smiling as they traded blows.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula extended his right arm forward for a more powerful punch, Tyson titled his body back to dodge it, and kicked Neb in the stomach. *Wham* Neb was knocked against a nearby mountain pillar. It&rsquo;s a good thing he has fast reflexes, he was able to land on his feet &amp;amp;amp; hands like Spiderman.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson wasn&rsquo;t about to give him any rest, he fired a ki blast. Nebula flew away from it and the mountain exploded. Tyson kept firing ki blasts like he was made of them. *Bam bam bam* Nebula kept bouncing from pillar to pillar, and his body became red. He was surrounded by a ball of flames - from all the speed he was gaining. *Bam bam*</p></p>

<p><p>When Tyson realized his beams won&rsquo;t hit, he charged up energy and flew downwards, and the momentum built up a blue shield around his body. Nebula flew up, his body becoming a fireball, and they slammed into each other. *Wham*</p></p>

<p><p>Tyke was hit and he was falling down. Just before he hit the ground, he stopped and turned right side up. Nebula descended to his level.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Whoa.&rdquo; Tyke said, bewildered. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a cool move. Have you been developing that?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I made it up just now.&rdquo; Neb replied in a confident tone. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m a natural genius.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> There a moment of silence. &ldquo;Have you thought about what Zelfire said?&rdquo; Tyson asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yep...I&rsquo;ll take it with a grain of salt.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re taking it pretty well.&rdquo; Tyson responded in a snarky tone.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh. I don&rsquo;t want to hear that from you!&rdquo; Nebula replied in an equally snarky tone.</p></p>

<p><p>Both of them gathered ki into their right arms until their right arms started glowing. Then they charged and hit each other. *Wham*</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="i">Mind Training 2 </span></p></center>

<p><p>Angela came barging into the office, startling Jerrell. &ldquo;Jerrell!&rdquo; she said, holding some papers in her hand.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Big news. We may have found the Assassin Squad&rsquo;s headquarters.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Jerrell stood up. &ldquo;Show me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Angela took him to the control room, where there was a giant TV screen. It showed them what the space probe saw before it was destroyed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;These asteroids were abandoned long ago by the Murai military. So there should be not a single life form there. But sensors found several power levels in the asteroids.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Jerrell replied. &ldquo;This may very well be where the Assassin Squad is hiding. Send more probes to monitor that area.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Angela saluted. Without wasting any time, she immediately ordered her subordinates to release the probes from the GP Station.</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey came into the control room, where Saran was sitting in his chair, facing the other way. &ldquo;Sir...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Saran turned around to face him. &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some unusual activity near the asteroid. We&rsquo;ve detected camera probes.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It must be the Galactic Police.&rdquo; said Saran. &ldquo;Its good they found this place. It means Jerrell will come to us.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sir, I doubt that Jerrell himself will appear. They will send Tyson Spade to destroy us.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Spade? That sayan is dead! I took care of him back on earth!&rdquo; Saran shouted.</p></p>

<p><p>His sudden shouting startled Spidey, causing him to cover his face with his arms.</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;He was nothing but a weakling. Now, prepare for battle.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes sir!&rdquo; Spidey bowed and left the room.</p></p>

<p><p>Seconds later, Azure entered the room.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What is it, Azure?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sir...I have a request to ask of you.&rdquo; He placed his hands on his chest and bowed. &ldquo;Please allow me to fight Nebula.&rdquo; He stared at the ground, and one can sense the intensity and hatred in his deep blue eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Nebula is one you fought last time?&rdquo; asked Saran.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes...I must settle the score with him.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;A warrior&rsquo;s pride, eh? Fine, you have my approval.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, commander.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Angela and Jerrell enter the heroes&rsquo; room. &ldquo;Guys, we&rsquo;ve got good news!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson was sitting on a bench, lifting a dumbbell. He put the dumbbell down and walked up next to Nebula and the others.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve found them...&rdquo; said Jerrell. &ldquo;We know where they are hiding. It&rsquo;s in a nearby asteroid belt with giant glass tubes.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Angela: &ldquo;These tubes were meant for deliveries...used by the Murai military to deliver weapons to their home planet.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson&rsquo;s eyes grew wide open with enthusiasm. &ldquo;That means...Faith is there.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Most likely.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The heroes, led by Angela, entered the giant space tubes. As they stared at the empty tubes, an eerie feeling came over them. In space, it is so quiet and there is no wind, and they were not used to it. Since there is no gravity in the tubes, they floated around without using any ki.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Flying around is a lot easier in zero gravity.&rdquo; said Mac. Out of everyone he was having the most fun.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This feels...so creepy.&rdquo; said Nebula.</p></p>

<p><p>They reached a fork in the road, four tubes that all lead to different paths. What now?&rdquo; Neb asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Angela replied. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have data on how the tubes work or what paths they lead to.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson closed his eyes and searched for Faith&rsquo;s ki. He tried hard but it was useless. &ldquo;Darn it. Her signal is too weak, I can&rsquo;t sense her.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire placed his hand on Tyson&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Remember what I told you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Tyson replied, a little annoyed. &ldquo;I have a feeling it&rsquo;s this one.&rdquo; he said, pointing at the tube to the far right. He flew in without any hesitation.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Angela said. &ldquo;Separating is dangerous.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s useless to stop him.&rdquo; Neb replied. &ldquo;The enemy is in one of these tubes. I&rsquo;m going to pick this one.&rdquo; He flew into the third tube.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well, I guess this one&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; Zelfire said, and with that, he flew into the second tube.</p></p>

<p><p>Mac: &ldquo;I guess that leaves you and me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Angela: &ldquo;Are you guys always this impatient?&rdquo;<br>  Mac: &ldquo;Oh, you have no idea.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>At the end of one of the tubes, Faith was bound to the metallic wall. Her wrists and ankles were bound by metal cuffs. She was unconscious and her head was facing down.</p></p>

<p><p>While flying in the tube, Tyson can faintly sense her. (I&rsquo;m coming to get you, Faith. Wait for me!)</p></p>


<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="l">Nebula vs Azure </span></p></center>


<p><p>Nebula came inside the large empty tube, hearing nothing but the sound of his own footsteps. Suddenly, he sensed someone else in the room, but saw nothing. Smoke appeared from a single point in the room and began to spread throughout. The smoke was actually a fog, considering the density and moisture.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I thought I smelled a rat around here.&rdquo; said a familiar voice.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula recognized the voice and became annoyed immediately. He remembers the voice very clearly, only one person could have such an annoying tone. Azure appeared from the fog.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t Nebula Spade. Long time no see. Maybe not long for you, but for me, it&rsquo;s been a looong time.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I wish I could say I was happy to see you...but your ugly face isn&rsquo;t exactly what I was looking forward to.&rdquo; Neb retorted.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh heh heh. The temperature colder out in space...so I have the advantage. Things won&rsquo;t go down the same way as last time!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula grunted and powered up, dispelling the fog. &ldquo;It may be colder here, but whatever advantage you have is just in your head!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Azure raised his arms over his head and released his ki. Because there&rsquo;s oxygen and moisture in the room, he can use his ki to turn the water droplets into ice crystals.</p></p>

<p><p>Neb was startled.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Do you know how long I&rsquo;ve waited for this day?! I&rsquo;ll pay you tenfold for the humiliation from last time!&rdquo; Azure used his telekinesis to throw the crystals forward.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula drew his sword and cut the crystals. *Slish Slash* For a skilled swordsman like him, cutting these sharp objects is not a problem at all. They were big and their projected path was a straight line. He cut them all without getting hit at all.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Is that all you&rsquo;ve got?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;If you think I&rsquo;ve only learned one new trick, you&rsquo;re mistaken.&rdquo; Azure put his palm on the floor and out came a trail of icicles heading in Nebula&rsquo;s direction. Nebula flew up to avoid getting hit.</p></p>

<p><p>Azure appeared on the ceiling and put his palms on it, and instantly created another trail of icicles. Nebula jumped away and floated in the air.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a dangerous trick, but useless against me.&rdquo; Neb said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Is it? Look around.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Neb was shocked, realizing that he&rsquo;s surrounded by icicles. Azure grunted and spread his arms out horizontally. The icicles came from the ice mountains and floated in front of Azure. They all turned horizontal, and they came flying at our hero.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula cut the crystals as they came at him. Some of them went past him. *Whoosh* Unlike last time, this time there was a lot more to handle. He blurred from place to place and slashed the crystals when he could. One of them hit his shoulder. *Slish* Another one scraped his thigh. &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; There was no time to react, he had to keep cutting the crystals.</p></p>

<p><p>When it was over, Azure laughed. &ldquo;Ha ha ha ha. Serves you right.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is nothing.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You humiliated me...as a member of the Assassin Squad. I must have my revenge. It&rsquo;s my assassin&rsquo;s pride on the line.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Assassin&rsquo;s pride? What a useless thing.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> Azure&rsquo;s eyes widen in anger. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t take any more insults from you!&rdquo; He spread out his arms again.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula&rsquo;s wounds hurt a lot, so he decided to attack head on. He charged forward. <br>  &ldquo;Not a good idea!&rdquo; Azure fired the Ice Beam. *Froom*</p></p>

<p><p>Neb tried to slice the beam in half. &ldquo;Hyuah!&rdquo; The beam hit his blade and split into two. But his blade became frozen. He tossed it to the air and it floated away.</p></p>

<p><p>The two fighters stared at each other, preparing for the upcoming battle. Nebula, as usual, wanted to give his enemy a pounding that he&rsquo;ll never forget. Azure, on the other hand, wants complete revenge for what happened during their last fight. He wants to torture Nebula and give him a painful death, his eyes gave off that kind of look.</p></p>

<p><p>They rushed forward and exchange fists. *Pow pow pow* They move back. Nebula&rsquo;s forearms had ice crystals from touching Azure.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh he he he. Did you forget? Touching me can be fatal. First I&rsquo;ll start with your hands. Then I&rsquo;ll freeze your whole body!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve said this before and I&rsquo;ll say it again. You can only freeze the outer layer of my clothes. You&rsquo;ll never freeze my boiling rage! Hyah!&rdquo; Nebula powered up, releasing waves of purple ki.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to freeze you like all my other victims!&rdquo; Azure fired the Ice Beam, Neb dodged it. He kept firing the Ice Beam as Neb jumped from one side of the tube to the other.</p></p>

<p><p>Unfortunately, he did not dodge perfectly. His left ankle was frozen.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha!&rdquo; laughed Azure. He fired another Ice Beam and Neb was unable to dodge it, and it froze his shoulder. &ldquo;Die, die, die!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Despite what happened, Neb remained calm. He clenched his fists and powered up, melting all the ice crystals on his body. Azure was shocked. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t work. You can&rsquo;t freeze a moving object.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Grrr...I&rsquo;m going to freeze you no matter what...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe me? I&rsquo;ll prove it to you now.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> Azure put his palms together and gathered energy for a big attack. Nebula&rsquo;s ki turned from purple to a fiery red color. His body was engulfed in a sphere of flames.</p></p>

<p><p>Azure&rsquo;s eyes widen in disbelief. &ldquo;When did you...&rdquo; Then he realized the answer instantly. &ldquo;I see...when you were bouncing back and forth before, he was using that time to gather ki. You&rsquo;re a crafty one.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But not as crafty as you. To defeat someone like you calls for a more straightforward method!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Azure was done gathering ki, and he released everything at once. The Ice Beam produced from his palms was taller than his own body. Nebula charged forward without any hesitation whatsoever, confident in his approach. He moved so fast he became a blazing comet. *Frooom*</p></p>

<p><p>The fiery comet plowed through Ice Beam with no problem at all, without lost any speed, as if the beam did not exist at all. Azure was completely shocked by this. Nebula was already close to him, and it was too late for him to react. Nebula&rsquo;s body hit Azure, pushing him back.</p></p>

<p><p>The ice warrior screamed in pain. &ldquo;Ughhhhh!! This c-can&rsquo;t be...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula screamed at the top of his lungs and pushed even harder. &ldquo;Hyyyaaahh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Azure was in dire pain, being an ice warrior, fire is his main weakness. The comet pushed Azure through the wall, and the momentum has him slammed through the next wall as well.</p></p>

<p><p>The icy assassin just floated around in space, injured and paralyzed from the attack. He was still in disbelief that he lost the fight, but his body was definitely more injured than his pride right now. He suffered second to third degree burns to his front torso.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula fired an energy beam to finish him off. As the beam hit Azure&rsquo;s body, he saw a bright light, followed by agonizing pain...and death.</p></p>


<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="j">Showdown in Space </span></p></center>

<p><p>Macintosh and Angela flew into the first tube, not knowing what to expect. The glass was transparent, giving them a nice view of outer space. Even if the glass is double layered, they felt uneasy, since the glass can break, sending them to their deaths.</p></p>

<p><p>When they reached the next room, they met an unpleasant surprise. An army of soldiers flew up to their height, stopping them in their tracks. These henchmen belonged to the Assassin Squad, as they had the look of assassins. There was nothing human about these killers - they all wore creepy ski masks and armed with claws and metal boots.</p></p>

<p><p>Then Mac and Angela heard laughter. Spidey floated up to their height, coming between the heroes and the group of soldiers. He had his arms crossed and his head held up, laughing as if victory was his. &ldquo;Heh heh heh. Look at what we got here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mac: &ldquo;You!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Angela: &ldquo;You know him?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mac: &ldquo;Yeah...I beat him. He&rsquo;s the weakest member of the Squad.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey grunted. &ldquo;Heh, that was in the past. Things are different now, as you have walked into my trap. You are surrounded...welcome to the spider&rsquo;s web. Gyah ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mac: &ldquo;Heh. Numbers don&rsquo;t mean a thing.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh. You won&rsquo;t be talking tough after I&rsquo;m through with you. Get&rsquo;em boys!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The masked soldiers flew past Spidey and attacked the heroes. Mac and Angela flew away to opposite ends and the enemies came at them in swarms. Mac punched the first one that came to him, and immediately, the one behind him tried to poke Mac in the face. He dodged and kicked the enemy in the chest, pushing him away.</p></p>

<p><p>Another one came for Mac. He fired the Electro-shockwave, taking out several of them at once. He fired another round of his move, knocking out a few more enemies. Suddenly, one of them came from above and tried to scratch him, and he dodged just in time.</p></p>

<p><p>Angela was having a hard time as well. The enemies were weak, but they were fast and large in numbers. They tried to come at her from both sides, and she punched with both arms. *Pow* One attacked her head on, she kicked him in the face. *Whack*</p></p>

<p><p>She drew her gun and shot a laser in the enemy&rsquo;s face. *Bang* Another one came from the right, she flew back and punched it in the face.</p></p>

<p><p>While the heroes were fighting for their lives, Spidey watched from the background, giggling as if he&rsquo;s certain of victory.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Angela spotted a big red button on the wall. According to her research, this button will turn gravity on and off in the tubes. She flew past the swarm of enemies and headed towards the ground.</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey wondered what she&rsquo;s doing. Then he realized that she&rsquo;s going for the big red button. &ldquo;Oh no you don&rsquo;t, woman!&rdquo; He floated towards her, but because of his physique, he was too slow to catch up.</p></p>

<p><p>Angela grabbed box on the wall to secure herself.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Noooo!!&rdquo; Spidey screamed.</p></p>

<p><p>She pushed the red button with her palm and the entire room shook. Gravity was turned on instantly, and everyone fell down. Spidey fell on his back and he groaned in pain. &ldquo;Ugh!!&rdquo; His goggles nearly popped out.</p></p>

<p><p>Mac fell on top of a soldier, making his fall softer. The soldier was probably unconscious or dead. All the soldiers fell and they&rsquo;re trying to regain their composure.</p></p>

<p><p>Angela turned around, and seeing that everyone&rsquo;s fallen, smiled triumphantly. &ldquo;Brains beat brawn any day of the week!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey bounced himself to his feet. &ldquo;Grrrr. Damn you woman!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mac got up on his feet, a little dizzy from the fall. But there&rsquo;s no time to rest, as a bunch of angry foot soldiers just got up, and they want his blood.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Macintosh, watch out!&rdquo; Angela shouted.</p></p>

<p><p>All of them leapt at him, and he quickly evaded. *Slash*</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey shot his web at Angela&rsquo;s wrist, gluing them together. &ldquo;Ugh? What is this disgusting stuff?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh heh.&rdquo; Spidey pulled the web string, forcing Angela to fall forward. *Wham* Spidey then jumped over her and hit the red button. Gravity is turned off again, and all objects in the room started to float up.</p></p>

<p><p>Mac and other soldiers floated up, and they were all startled for a few seconds. The bloodthirsty soldiers flew at him, and he had to defend himself from the onslaught, kicking and punching them away.</p></p>

<p><p>Angela, on the other hand, was not doing so well. With her wrists and hands covered in webbing, she was helpless. Spidey held the other end of the web, and he swings her against the wall. *Wham* She cried out in pain.</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey then swings her to the other side, hitting the wall again. *Wham*</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mac! Help!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mac has his hands full already. The soldiers kept getting in front of him, not letting him escape. &ldquo;Shit...&rdquo; There was no room to even edge his way through. Then he smiled as he thought of something. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t underestimate me, you goons!&rdquo; He pointed his fists out and fired a shockwave at the soldiers, but just before the point of contact, the shockwave curved up and flew past the troops, and curved down and hit Spidey.</p></p>

<p><p>*Zap* He was caught by surprise, and he became black and full of smoke. &ldquo;Aaaaah!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mac then took care of the remaining soldiers, and promptly went to Angela&rsquo;s aid. He gathered electricity into his palms and used it to melt the web that bound Angela&rsquo;s hands.</p></p>

<p><p>Angela: &ldquo;That was a new move. I&rsquo;ve never seen that one before.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mac: &ldquo;Heh. It&rsquo;s all thanks to Zelfire&rsquo;s training.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The two of them quickly got serious, since there&rsquo;s no time to celebrate. There&rsquo;s still some soldiers floating around, staring at the heroes. Mac fired an energy ball at the big red button, causing all the soldiers, including Spidey to fall down. *Wham*</p></p>

<p><p>Mac and Angela charged into the fallen soldiers to finish them off. In the middle of all the hitting, Spidey woke up with a headache. Mac and Spidey laid eyes on each other. Spidey snarled at him. &ldquo;You...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So, are you ready for another beating like last time?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey grunted. &ldquo;Last time it was just luck! This time it&rsquo;ll be different, just you see!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mac remained calm and confident, knowing his words can get a reaction out of this freak. &ldquo;Where is Faith? Is she in this tube?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that? Are you talking about the healing woman? Hahaha.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mac frowned at his laughter.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So you came all the way to space just to get the woman? I didn&rsquo;t know you cared so much.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Are you going to tell me or not, or do I have to beat the answer out of you?!&rdquo; He gathered his ki and fired a shockwave.</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey jumped over it. &ldquo;Ha. Try if you can. In the Assassin Squad, I am known as the fastest and most versatile one!&rdquo; He dodged more shockwaves, jumping and blurring all over the place.</p></p>

<p><p>Mac kept firing non-stop, hoping he&rsquo;ll get at least one hit in. *Zap zap zap*</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey kept dodging and laughing maniacally. Mac took a break because he was tired. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re one slippery son of a bitch!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey appeared above him. &ldquo;Thanks, I&rsquo;ll take that as a compliment!&rdquo; He shot his spider web at Mac&rsquo;s hands.</p></p>

<p><p>Mac was not worried at all. &ldquo;This won&rsquo;t work on me. Haven&rsquo;t you learned anything from our last fight? I can break free from this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s going to take you time. A few seconds at most. And then...I can do this!&rdquo; Spidey did a somersault in the air and kicked Mac in the chest, knocking him down.</p></p>

<p><p>Angela saw what happened, but she was too occupied to help. One of the masked soldiers slashed at her, she dodged and kicked him away. Another one rushed at her, and she gathered ki into her fist and punched it in the face. Its mask broke and it fell down.</p></p>

<p><p>Mac struggled to break free from the webbing. Spidey came from behind and grabbed him. His fingers were locked together against Mac&rsquo;s chest, and his legs were locked against Mac&rsquo;s legs. &ldquo;Gotcha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh...you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now you can&rsquo;t hit me! Hahahaha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Despite being a small guy, Spidey was still heavy, clinging on to Mac&rsquo;s back. He stumbled around, grunting in pain from the body lock.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, he thought of something. Mac charged up electricity into his arms, destroying the webbing. He fired a shockwave forward, hitting the wall, and the force pushed Mac and Spidey backwards. They slammed against the red button, turning gravity on.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oooff!&rdquo; screamed Spidey. His goggles nearly popped out from the impact. Not only did his back hit the wall, but a grown man&rsquo;s body was slammed into him, making it extra painful for his small frame. As gravity was turned on, his body slid up against the wall, escaping from Macintosh&rsquo;s back.</p></p>

<p><p>All the soldiers that were dead or unconscious floated up, and the tube was full of floating bodies. Angela, who was in the middle of all this, finally took a breather. &ldquo;That was a close one.&rdquo; she said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No kidding.&rdquo; Mac replied.</p></p>


<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="k">Zell vs Blue </span></p></center>


<p><p>Blue was waiting in his area, with his arms crossed. Zelfire showed up. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, earthling. I was expecting Tyson Spade.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well, sorry to disappoint you.&rdquo; Zell retorted with sarcasm. &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ll just have to make do with me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Blue smirked. &ldquo;This will be over quickly.&rdquo; He turned invisible.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Invisibility doesn&rsquo;t work on me anymore.&rdquo; Zell retorted. He closed his eyes and calmly waited for his enemy&rsquo;s presence to appear.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Zell turned 180 degrees and blocked something. *Pow* It was Blue&rsquo;s fist. Blue&rsquo;s whole body became visible and he jumped back.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve underestimated you....what was your name?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Zelfire Lang, and don&rsquo;t you forget it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmm. You see, Zelfire, being invisible is an ability that&rsquo;s for underlings. I , on the other hand, do not need to use it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You just used it...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;To test you. I&rsquo;ve never used invisibility to kill anyone. Because I don&rsquo;t need to.&rdquo; Blue was wearing a backpack the whole time. It started to shake and grow black mechanical legs. Eight legs sprang out of the backpack, and they were three times taller than Blue, and as they hit the ground, Blue was lifted up.</p></p>

<p><p>Zell watched in awe as this transpired. The backpack was so small, and yet it grew such large, imposing weapons. The spider&rsquo;s legs were made of black metal and they had a certain shine to them, and the tips were sharp and deadly. &ldquo;So...this is what Tyson had to fight?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;These are my weapons.&rdquo; said Blue proudly as he crossed his arms. &ldquo;They are my arms and legs. They have been upgraded since being destroyed by Tyson. But he&rsquo;s not here, and I&rsquo;m not happy about. I&rsquo;m going to tear you apart until he shows up!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The spider legs dived forward, and Zell jumped away. The leg hit the ground. *Smash* The spider moved forward and continued its frontal assault, diving its legs at him. Zell dashed away. *Smash* He felt a lot lighter in zero gravity, so dodging them isn&rsquo;t a problem. The spider continued its relentless assault, attacking from the left, then right, then left again. *Smash smash*</p></p>

<p><p>Zell jumped and took it to the air. His movements were much faster and his body was much lighter in space, so he figured he has the advantage. Blue took it to the air, and his spider claws were eager to shed blood. It made a stab at Zell, who dashed away to the left.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be able to reach me with your speed.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to reach you. Remember when I said I had these upgraded?&rdquo; Zell became surprised. The tip of the mechanical leg opened and revealed a hole that had a blue light. All the tips of the legs opened up and fired lasers. Zell evaded them. *Zap* Blue fired another round. *Zap*</p></p>

<p><p>Zell flew backwards while evading the deadly lasers. *Zap zap* The situation suddenly turned for the worst for our hero. Blue had eight legs and that means he can fire lasers in eight directions. Dodging is no longer trivial matter, but one of life and death.</p></p>

<p><p>*Zap* He was doing well dodging, but eventually he will get hit. He opened his right palm and put his left palm behind it, and fired an energy ball. *Froom*</p></p>

<p><p>The eight spider legs recoil to surround Blue&rsquo;s body. *Bam* The energy ball hit the mecha legs and did no damage whatsoever.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Zell exclaimed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My spider legs do more than just attack. They do offensive as well as defensive maneuvers. Every single movement is being controlled by my mind.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That is not good...for me!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Blue&rsquo;s mecha legs opened up and fired lasers. *Zap* Zelfire dodged them just in time. Blue dashed forward and one of the legs swings itself at Zell. He saw it, but it was too late to avoid it. *Whack* It hit him in the chest and threw him against the wall - or the floor - it doesn&rsquo;t matter - because they&rsquo;re in space and direction doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p></p>

<p><p>One claw opened itself up like a crab&rsquo;s claw and squeezed Zelfire by the stomach, causing him to scream in agony. &ldquo;Aaaaaaagh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Blue&rsquo;s lips contorted into a smirk, knowing he has his victim right where he wants him. &ldquo;Yes...it hurts doesn&rsquo;t it? Writhe in pain. Feel my power crushing your body into pieces.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zell can feel his bones being crushed and he screamed in agony and his body convulsed. &ldquo;Ughhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>One of the claws put itself on top of Zelfire&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s end it in one go...I&rsquo;m going to rip your head right off your body!&rdquo; The claw opened it up and aimed for Zelfire&rsquo;s face.</p></p>

<p><p>With his body trapped under the claw, Zell was in a desperate situation. And with the second claw about to grab his neck and behead him, he was staring death in the face. He has to do something quick, or it could be the end of our hero.</p></p>

<p><p>The claw dived for his head. *Wham!* Zell titled his head to the side to avoid it. The metal scratched his cheek and his cheek was bleeding. He grabbed the claw with both hands and tried to pull it away from his face. But the claw was heavy and being controlled by Blue, and he struggled with it. He used all the strength in his muscles, grunting and groaning, just to keep it from cutting his neck.</p></p>

<p><p>Then he shoved the claw into the claw holding his torso hostage. *Clash* Both claws broke and he was able to slip out in one piece. Right after that he floated to the air.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue was not pleased with the events that just transpired. &ldquo;You...broke them! You broke my precious weapons! Grrr!&rdquo; The spider had six legs left and they opened up and charged themselves up.</p></p>

<p><p>Zell knew what was coming, and he dodged the lasers. *Zap Zap* Blue was furious and he fired faster than ever before. Zell blurred and dashed forward into the line of fire. It was a risky move but he must do it anyway. He appeared to the side and grabbed one of the legs just before it was about to fire. He twisted the leg to make it face another leg, and it fired off a laser. *Zap* The other leg was destroyed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What have you done!&rdquo; Blue exclaimed. Now only five claws remain.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Your weapons aren&rsquo;t as intimidating now. Its power has been reduced to half.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to kill you!&rdquo; The claws pointed in Zell&rsquo;s direction and fired rapidly, signalling Blue&rsquo;s impatience.</p></p>

<p><p>Zell put his palms together to gether ki and fired the Energy Blast. *Froom*</p></p>

<p><p>The claws retract to protect Blue&rsquo;s body, and the beam pushed him back all the way against the wall. Seconds later, the beam ran out of steam and disintegrated. The claws opened up. &ldquo;Ha...hahahaha. It still won&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Look again.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Blue looked at the claws and realized they were damaged. The metal was torn open and the circuits were fried. &ldquo;No! This can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Like I said, with three of the legs damaged, you had only five remaining that protected you, and they weren&rsquo;t strong enough. It looks like you failed. You relied on your weapons of destruction too much and you lost.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I did not lose yet! I still have yet to use my greatest weapon, myself!&rdquo; Blue undid the backpack containing the spider legs and flew forward. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need those things anyway, I&rsquo;ll just fight you with my own body.&rdquo; Blue let himself float forward, slowly moving towards his enemy. He clenched his fists to power up. Electric currents surrounded his body. *Zzzzzzt* He was surrounded by an aura of blue color.</p></p>

<p><p>It was Zelfire&rsquo;s turn. He clenched his fists and screamed as waves of energy surrounded his body. Veins popped up in his biceps and he was surrounded by a white aura.</p></p>

<p><p>The two warriors blurred out of sight and hit each other in the tube. Only sounds of impact were heard. *Bam bam bam*</p></p>

<p><p>They took a break and went back to their original positions. Suddenly, Blue felt pain in his cheek, and a trickle of blood dripped down his lip. He wiped his lip and stared profusely at the blood. &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; He grew angry.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue dashed forward and punched, but to no avail. Zell blocked his fist and squeezed it, causing Blue to groan in pain. &ldquo;Let go of me!&rdquo; He desperately tried to pull his fist away, but Zell&rsquo;s grip was solid. &ldquo;Take this!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Blue&rsquo;s arm became charged with electricity so it can electrify Zell&rsquo;s hand. But it had no effect whatsoever. &ldquo;What...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zell let go of his fist, then punched him in the cheek. *Pow*</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How...can this be?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I concentrated all the ki in my body towards my left arm, so your electric attack has no effect me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never even considered that!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmph. There&rsquo;s a lot of combat strategies you haven&rsquo;t seen. I&rsquo;m a lot older than I look.&rdquo; Zelfire replied, unusually proud. &ldquo;And I have more combat experience than you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Grrr...I&rsquo;ve killed a lot more people than you ever have.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve killed people using cowardly methods, like those spider claws. You never did physical training or anything of the sort. You&rsquo;re an assassin, not a warrior. You&rsquo;ve never had a fair fight before, that&rsquo;s why in a fair fight you will never beat me!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Blue was shocked by the truth in his words. His eyes widened and his jaw dropped open. But that shock soon turned into anger. &ldquo;You...I&rsquo;ll kill you just like the rest!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zell blurred and appeared directly in front of him. Blue was stunned for a moment. Zell immediately punched him in the chest, causing him to spit saliva. Then he let out a flurry of punches to the face, and some to the chest. *Pow pow pow* Blue was helpless as he got hit over and over and had no time to retaliate.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is for everyone you&rsquo;ve killed!&rdquo; Zelfire screamed angrily as he kept pounding Blue&rsquo;s face.</p></p>

<p><p>When he was finished with his combo, Zell concluded with a roundhouse kick to the face. *Wham* Blue was thrown against the wall. He could barely move now that he&rsquo;s battered and bruised. His face was full of bruises and blood was dripping down his chin, and many of his bones were broken. But it wasn&rsquo;t just physical pain he was feeling, he was humiliated as well. This feeling was hauntingly familiar...when did he feel this before? Blue&rsquo;s eyes widened when he realized this reminded of his fight with Tyson, because the fight ended the same way.</p></p>

<p><p>Zell fired a beam and it made a direct hit on Blue. *Zzzzzzzt* &ldquo;Aaaaaaaaaah!!!&rdquo; The beam pushed his body all the way to the ceiling. After the beam ran out, Blue&rsquo;s fried up body floated in the air.</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="m">Spade vs Saran </span></p></center>


<p><p>*Froom* Tyson&rsquo;s body resembled a blue meteor as he flew at full speed. His impatience was getting the better of him and he did not care about using up his ki. He knows what&rsquo;s waiting for him at the other end - his most hated enemy to date - the one who took everything away from him.</p></p>

<p><p>When Tyson arrived at the end of the tube, he came to an abrupt stop. Saran was there at the same altitude, crossing his arms. They just stared at each other...as they always do before a big fight. Tyson was extremely angry and who could blame him? He hurt Faith and took her away when he was injured. But now he is not injured and at full strength. His only thought is to give Saran the pounding of his life. Saran, however, was completely oblivious to his enemy&rsquo;s anger. He&rsquo;s been hurting and killing people all his life, so to him, his acts of cruelty it&rsquo;s no big deal. He&rsquo;s the kind of man who only fights when the situation is advantageous to him. Right now he feels rather confident, so does that mean he has something up his sleeve?</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you...&rdquo; Tyson said, gritting his teeth.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We meet again.&rdquo; Saran replied. &ldquo;If I remember correctly, last time you got completely wrecked.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson turned super sayan. *Flash*</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh? So this is the legendary power that Indigo wanted so badly?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make you pay for everything you&rsquo;ve done!&rdquo; The sayan dashed forward and struck with his forearm. Saran blocked it and got knocked by a little. They both blurred and exchange blows. *Bam bam bam*</p></p>

<p><p>Up until now, this is just like any other battle between two superpowers. However, Saran is not like any other enemies that the hero has faced before. Tyson let his rage get the better of him and attacked recklessly without any foresight. He punched and Saran blocked his fist. Wires protrude out of Saran&rsquo;s suit and tie up Tyson&rsquo;s wrist.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson was freaked out by this. The wires quickly bury his palm and wrist, and moved towards his forearm. His wires were thin, but they were as hard as steel, and some of them penetrated the skin in his arm. Tyson groaned and tried to pull away to no avail. He released ki into his free hand and made a hand sword and cut the wires and backed away. Then he looked at his injured hand and tested his grip. Everything from the elbow down was hurting and his fingers were trembling.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Nice escape.&rdquo; Saran commented.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right...this is your specialty.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This suit is part of my body and those wires can drain your ki completely dry.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So fighting at close range is out of the question.&rdquo; Tyson threw an energy ball forward, and Saran evaded it with ease. Tyson threw another one, and another one. And he made the balls faster and threw them like he&rsquo;s giving them away for free.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran dodged by evading side to side. He raised his right arm and wires protrude out of it, and they head upwards from the fist. The wires tie themselves up into a knot and even tighter, forming a sharp object. He sent his ki into it and it became a live sword.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson continued his flurry of energy balls as Saran smacked them with his sword. *Bam bam* Saran propelled himself and continued to smash the incoming balls, getting closer to his target. Tyson flew backwards while throwing balls but his enemy was catching up. Suddenly Saran was in front of him and stabbed. Tyson dodged. *Whoosh*</p></p>

<p><p>Saran kept stabbing at his torso, aiming for a vital organ. Tyson dashed backwards to a safer distance. Saran dashed forward and raised his right arm, making his makeshift sword vertical, and brought it down. Tyson crossed his arms over his chest and released ki from all parts of his body. The Energy Shield surrounded his body from all angles. It was a move he learned long ago, and in super sayan form the shield was vibrant golden color. Saran&rsquo;s makeshift sword hit the shield and could not go any further...and the wires disintegrated into dust.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran moved backwards. &ldquo;How resourceful. I didn&rsquo;t know you had that move.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, never had a fair fight before?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an assassin, I never fight fair! I still have an ace up my sleeve. Now watch and behold.&rdquo; He folded his fingers together like a ninja. &ldquo;My clone technique!&rdquo; Saran&rsquo;s body was glowing and suddenly, two copies of himself appeared. One of them was higher in altitude, his hands placed on his hips. Another copy was on the floor, his arms crossed. Two more copies appeared behind Tyson, who was bewildered by the turn of events. One more clone appeared and he was standing upside down from the ceiling. One more clone appeared from the left. They were all taunting and snickering at the hero.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just an illusion...I&rsquo;m not falling for it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh? Is it just an illusion?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson closed his eyes to calm himself down. To him, this is no different than dealing with invisibility. He used the same technique to beat Aqua, and this time it&rsquo;s no different. His sixth sense tracked down Saran&rsquo;s ki. Suddenly, Tyson&rsquo;s eyes opened and he threw an energy ball at one of the Sarans. The ball went through his body.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo; Tyson exclaimed in shock.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wrong choice!&rdquo; said Saran #2. He flew down to deliver a flying kick to Tyson&rsquo;s shoulder, pushing him lower in altitude.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran #3 dashed and let out a fury of punches to our hero. Then Saran #1 dashed and attacked him from the left side. Tyson blocked all their attacks, but he was being pushed back and didn&rsquo;t even have half a second to fight back. *Pow pow pow*</p></p>

<p><p>Saran #4 was already behind him, waiting for him to get close enough. Saran #1 and #3 both jabbed Tyson&rsquo;s stomach at the same time, knocking him into Saran #4, who kicked him in the back. *Wham*</p></p>

<p><p>He didn&rsquo;t even have time to process the pain. Saran #5 kicked him in the stomach, knocking him higher up. Saran #6 put his fists together form a hammer, and hit Tyson in the back *Wham* The hero fell to the floor on his face. He took a bunch of deadly hits in a row and he was in a daze. &ldquo;Ughhh...&rdquo; He put his palms face down and lifted his torso up and got on one knee.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran #7 landed in front of him. &ldquo;Heh. That was easy, what a disappointing fight this turned out to be.&rdquo; Wires protrude out of his biceps and torso and gathered around Tyson&rsquo;s wrists and tied them up.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson freaked out and desperately pulled away, but the wires would not budge even an inch. They tied up his wrists tightly and continued to move down his forearms, almost reaching his elbows. &ldquo;Uuughhh...ughhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Indigo wanted to have your super sayan powers so badly. Too bad he&rsquo;s gone. But now I get to realize his dream.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You...&rdquo; Tyson blurted out angrily. The wires reach Tyson&rsquo;s neck and squeezed it, causing him much discomfort.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now, give me your super sayan energy!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sure enough, the wires inject themselves into Tyson&rsquo;s skin and drain his ki. The sayan screamed in agony. &ldquo;Aaaaaaah!&rdquo; Not only was his ki drained, it felt as if the wires were draining his own blood, draining his own life. He was helpless in this position, and just kneeled there as Saran drained all his ki. Every second that passed by felt like an hour, and he can feel his ki emptying out...and soon it will completely empty.</p></p>

<p><p>He wonders if it&rsquo;s over...he promised he&rsquo;d save Faith no matter what...but now it may not happen. He can still Faith&rsquo;s ki, despite how weak it was. It means she&rsquo;s nearby, less than half a mile away. She is so close, and yet he can&rsquo;t do a thing.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson&rsquo;s hands were placed on the ground, keeping him from falling. his head was facing down and he was groaning in pain. Eventually, Saran was done draining his ki. He looked at his hands and opened and closed them as if he&rsquo;s never seen his hands before. &ldquo;Oohhh yes...this is what I was looking for! I feel the power! It&rsquo;s almost overwhelming! It makes me wish I was born a sayan. But at least you&rsquo;re not good for nothing. I think I&rsquo;ll keep you alive...just so I can drain your energy and get stronger.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>This whole time, his face was down. But then he looked up with a dead serious face. &ldquo;You want more energy? Then I&rsquo;ll give you all of it.&rdquo; As promised, Tyson let out a groan and he released his ki into the wires of his own free will.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran was worried. &ldquo;Hey...stop...stop doing that!&rdquo; His suit was overheating from the excess energy. Tyson did not stop and continued to release his ki into Saran&rsquo;s body. Smoke came out of the suit, and Saran&rsquo;s body became hot.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran gathered ki into his hand and formed a hand sword and cut off the wires, saving his suit and his own body. He stumbled backwards and was out of breath. &ldquo;That was a close one...taking too much super sayan energy is dangerous.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson stood up, his head still facing down, and ripped the wires off of him. Saran was now worried, his own body was injured and his enemy is somehow able to stand up after all that torture. Tyson&rsquo;s aura projected out his body and it was increasing by the second. Then he looked up at Saran.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not over yet...you have to pay for everything you&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Saran&rsquo;s wires came out his suit in various places and curved and injected back into his suit. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing my suit is self repairing.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to let you!&rdquo; Tyson dashed forward and punched, Saran blocked by crossing his arms in front of his face. *Wham* He got pushed back and leapt to the air. Suddenly, Tyson appeared directly in front of him, surprising him. He jabbed Saran in the stomach, causing him to spit saliva. He followed up with an uppercut to the chin. But he wasn&rsquo;t close to done - he kept jabbing and crossing Saran in the face. Saran was unable to fight back and received the pounding of his life. *Pow pow pow*</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson did not hold back one bit and let out all his rage. This is what he wanted to do ever since Saran tortured Faith. *Pow pow pow*</p></p>

<p><p>Saran grabbed both of his fists and they both grunted in the power struggle. Tyson gave him a head butt to the forehead. Saran groaned in pain. Tyson followed up with a hard punch to the cheek. *Pow*</p></p>

<p><p>Saran wiped the blood off his lips. &ldquo;Fine...if I can&rsquo;t have your energy, I will kill you instead!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson dashed forward, his fists still itching to punch some more. Saran put his fingers together like a ninja and made seven copies of himself just like before. Tyson stopped mid-flight.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran #2 and Saran #4 attacked him from the left and front sides, and he blocked them while backing away.</p></p>

<p><p>#3 was waiting from behind. As soon as Tyson got closer enough, he kicked him in the back. *Wham* He got tossed to #4, who kicked him, making him go higher. #5 was above, and he kicked Tyson in the stomach. *Wham* Just like before, the hero was helpless as he was being tossed around like a pin ball.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, both Tyson and Saran sensed a third ki in the room. Nebula showed up. &ldquo;What the? Am I seeing things or does this guy have a lot of twins?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wait...if you&rsquo;re here...it means Azure lost the fight?&rdquo; Saran inquired.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He tried real hard, but in the end, he was no match for me.&rdquo; Neb said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Just who exactly are you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Nebula, there&rsquo;s another assassin in the room! Look for Groggy!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Saran&rsquo;s eyes grew wide open. &ldquo;You know Groggy? You&rsquo;ve done your research.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson smiled. &ldquo;The Galactic Police&rsquo;s knowledge base is quite extensive. I know it&rsquo;s Groggy who is making copies of you. It&rsquo;s an illusion he created to trick my mind into thinking it&rsquo;s real. It makes sense that you have a psychic on your team. That explains how Blue escaped from the most secure prison in the galaxy.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Saran shrugged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m impressed. You came prepared...all this for revenge.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula landed on the floor. He looked all around and saw no one else in the room, so he must be invisible. Also there&rsquo;s no other ki besides Tyson and Saran, so he must be hiding his ki. If this person really is in the room, he must be an expert in hiding his presence. Remembering Zelfire&rsquo;s training, he closed his eyes so he can focus on his surroundings.</p></p>

<p><p> Saran #5 appeared from Tyson&rsquo;s left side. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way your friend can find Groggy. Out of all the assassins, he&rsquo;s the stealthiest one.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I believe in Nebula. He&rsquo;ll find him for sure.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Saran #5 punched and Tyson blocked with his wrist. Tyson powered up, releasing golden ki from his body, pushing that Saran a few feet away. The Energy Shield protects Tyson&rsquo;s body from harm - whether the attack is physical or ki based. In super sayan form, the shield was a golden color.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran #5 punched the shield and hurt his hand. &ldquo;Ugh...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson punched him and he disappeared. &ldquo;One down, six to go.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Saran #2 and #3 fired beams and they exploded on his shield. *Kaboom* The shield, as well as Tyson, was unharmed.</p></p>

<p><p>Then all six Sarans fired beams on his shield. Tyson crossed his arms over his face to brace for impact. A big explosion happened. *<strong>Kaboom</strong>* The shield was destroyed, leaving Tyson&rsquo;s body exposed. All the Sarans rushed him at once. Just like last time, Tyson was overwhelmed and got the pounding of his life. No matter how fast he was, he had only four limbs, and all his enemies had four limbs each.</p></p>

<p><p>A few minutes have passed since Nebula closed his eyes. In the background, he can hear Tyson&rsquo;s groans of pain, but he drowned them out as background noise. Zelfire&rsquo;s training came at handy at a time like this. As fighters, they rely too much on their 6th sense. If the enemy is hiding their ki as they were now, they&rsquo;d be impossible to detect. But no one can hide their own presence - everyone has a body that has blood and has to breathe air.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Nebula opened his eyes. &ldquo;There!&rdquo; He threw an energy ball at the roof. Suddenly, Groggy appeared at the target area and jumped away from the ball. *Boom* Groggy landed on the floor.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised you could find me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula pointed his finger at him. &ldquo;Heh. You can&rsquo;t hide from me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I underestimated you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>With Groggy distracted, all the fake Sarans disappeared. The real Saran remained, and he was not happy about it. Tyson finally got some space to breathe. &ldquo;You did it, Nebula.&rdquo; He wiped the blood off his lips. &ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s see how you do without someone else helping you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Grrrr! So you saw through my plans. That&rsquo;s fine. Because my suit is done repairing itself.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not going to help you.&rdquo; said Tyson arrogantly.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran&rsquo;s eyes widened. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The energy that you took from me...was inconsequential.&rdquo; Suddenly, Tyson blurred and appeared in front of Saran and sucker punched him. *Pow*</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh. Nobody escapes my mind control powers. Nobody!&rdquo; Groggy started to concentrate and his body, as well as his helmet, started glowing. Suddenly, three raptor like creatures appeared. &ldquo;Allow me to introduce to you the Centilians, they are carnivores from planet Murai. They look pretty hungry.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You think these illusions will work on me?&rdquo; Neb retorted. He opened his palm to fire a ki blast. *Bam*</p></p>

<p><p>The creatures went through the explosion unharmed, surprising Neb. One of them tried to stab him, Neb blocked with his forearm. The creature&rsquo;s limbs were bigger and packed with dense muscles, and Neb&rsquo;s arm was hurting. He jumped back.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh! For an illusion, that sure hurt a lot.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; Groggy taunted. &ldquo;The pain you&rsquo;re feeling is real. As long as your mind thinks it&rsquo;s real, your body can&rsquo;t tell the difference.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Another one of the raptors scratched Neb in the stomach. He jumped away to avoid a fatal stab. He looked at his wound and it was bleeding, and it hurt as if it&rsquo;s real. &ldquo;Shit...this pain...this hurts a lot for an illusion.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh heh. I told you so.&rdquo; said Groggy.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula sat on lotus position and closed his eyes. He must remain 100% calm to keep his mind from being poisoned.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What the hell are you doing? Are you out of your mind?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He continued to meditate and Groggy grew annoyed. &ldquo;Kill him!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The raptors roared and inched their ways towards Nebula. They drooled and growled at him. Nebula&rsquo;s eyes remain closed and he did not even flinch. One of the raptors stuck its claw into his face, but it went through his face instead. Then all the raptors disappeared.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula&rsquo;s eyes opened and he stood up. &ldquo;Those are nothing but mind tricks. I&rsquo;ve figured out your trick, and it won&rsquo;t work anymore.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Groggy growled angrily. His psychic tricks have always worked and he&rsquo;s never known failure. This is the first time something like this has happened. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll...you&rsquo;ll pay for this!&rdquo; He charged energy into his fist and dashed forward.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula dashed forward and pulled out his sword. *Slish slash* They went past each other and there was silence for a moment. Groggy looked down and saw blood on his torso. He screamed and fell down.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran felt his comrade&rsquo;s ki disappear. &ldquo;Groggy was defeated? Damn it. He has the best psychic abilities, but he&rsquo;s physically weak.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Your little illusion tricks won&rsquo;t work anymore! Without them you&rsquo;re nothing.&rdquo; Tyson fired a ki blast and Saran knocked it away. Suddenly, Tyson appeared in front of him and kneed him in the stomach.</p></p>

<p><p>*Thud* Saran was pushed backwards and he grabbed his stomach and grunted in agony. &ldquo;Ughhhh!&rdquo; Tyson punched him in the face, knocking him back more.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran was hurt pretty badly and he needed moment to breathe. One hand was still grabbing his stomach. Tyson&rsquo;s eyes showed he was angry and not going to show any mercy. These were the same eyes he showed when they first met in his spaceship...no, they were even more intimidating because they were a super sayan&rsquo;s eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>The situation was not in his favor at all. But being the villain that he is, he always has a trick up his sleeve. &ldquo;So be it!&rdquo; Saran gathered energy into his palm and threw it forward, Tyson countered with his own energy. *Kaboom* The smoke gave him the distraction needed. Saran powered up and flew down the tube.</p></p>

<p><p>When the smoke cleared away, Tyson was shocked that Saran was already down the tube. He powered up and chased his enemy. *Froom*</p></p>

<p><p>The tubes were endlessly long and he grew impatient. Saran was still in his line of sight and he flew at stop speed to make sure he catches his enemy. Once Saran reached the end of the tube, there was a huge metal wall where Faith was bound to. As soon as he saw the end, Tyson hit the brakes.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran&rsquo;s wires protrude from his arm and tied up Faith&rsquo;s neck. She was unconscious, unaware of the danger she was in. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come any closer, or I&rsquo;ll crush her neck.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson clenched his fist and gritted his teeth. Saran once again was playing dirty, but then again, it&rsquo;s not surprising considering his character. He&rsquo;s just predictably despicable. But he&rsquo;s not going to use Faith as a hostage anymore, this won&rsquo;t be the same as last time.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson blurred and appeared directly in front of Saran, who was completely surprised. Tyson punched him in the face, knocking him away. Tyson then pulled the metal cuffs off Faith&rsquo;s wrists. Then he pulled the cuffs off her ankles.</p></p>

<p><p>With her limbs free, she started to drift towards him. But there was no time for a reunion, because Saran was not done yet. He was angry that his plan failed and he was hit in the cheek. His cheek was still stinging, and many other parts of his body were aching from the beating just minutes ago. Saran has never known failure before so he's extremely pissed off and desperate.</p></p>

<p><p>He powered up and his body became charged with electricity. Tyson, sensing Saran&rsquo;s ki, turned around to look. Saran's body was glowing and his palms were open and facing forward. &ldquo;Thanks for all the energy earlier. Now I&rsquo;m giving it all back to you...plus interest!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was drifting away from him, but he didn&rsquo;t have the luxury to worry about her, lest they both will be blown to smithereens.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson opened his palms and put them forward and gathered all the energy he had in his body for this final attack. Saran was only seconds away from being done and he felt the desperation. He had to do it now or never.</p></p>

<p><p>Saran fired the biggest beam he&rsquo;s ever fired and Tyson fired the Super Sayan Beam. *Froom* The two beams met in the middle and exploded. *Kaboom*</p></p>

<p><p>The explosion sent Saran flying like a bullet towards the glass, and he broke through it. *Whoosh* He screamed in agony as his body was sent into space. But he didn&rsquo;t have time to experience the deadliness of space as his suit overloaded and exploded. *Kaboom*</p></p>

<p><p>There was a hole on the glass and everything was being sucked away. Papers were and small objects were flying all over the place, and their eventual destination was the darkness of space. Tyson grunted as he struggled to stay afloat, but the force of the suction was dragging his body closer and closer to his inevitable doom. &ldquo;Uuuuuuugh!&rdquo; He was only a feet away from the hole, when suddenly a metallic wall came down from the ceiling.</p></p>


<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="n">Doing it in Space</span></p></center>

<p><p>Tyson landed against the metal wall with his bare hands, but it wasn&rsquo;t enough to stop the momentum, and his face slammed against the wall too. It hurt to have his whole body slam against the hard metal, even in SS mode. But at least the danger is over now, and he returned to normal mode, his hair turning black.</p></p>

<p><p>The metal wall was a safety mechanism of the space station, made specifically for a situation like this. So Tyson and his beloved woman were spared.</p></p>

<p><p>Even though his whole body was hurting, Faith was more important. Tyson turned around and saw Faith floating around aimlessly. It&rsquo;s a good thing she wasn&rsquo;t sucked into space. He flew towards her and reached for her. Without any ki left, all he could do was float in her direction very slowly.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Faith!&rdquo; he cried out. &ldquo;Faith! Wake up!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She was slowly gaining consciousness as she heard her name being called.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Faith! Faith!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Her eyes opened and blinked and he became fully conscious. &ldquo;Tyson!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Faith!&rdquo; he said, smiling.</p></p>

<p><p>She also flashed a big smile, seeing her loved one in front of her. She hasn&rsquo;t smiled or laughed in a long time...after all the torture she&rsquo;s been through. But seeing Tyson&rsquo;s face made her forget all the bad memories.</p></p>

<p><p>She reached out for him and her body floated towards him. They both slowly floated towards each other, reaching desperately, knowing it&rsquo;s only a matter of seconds before they can embrace each other.</p></p>

<p><p>The knot on her towel slipped off her chest...and the towel slid off her body and floated away from her. Tyson&rsquo;s eyes widened in shock. Faith gasped in shock. She looked down and confirmed that she was naked. She screamed and covered herself. &ldquo;Aaaaaah!&rdquo; Her left arm covered her breasts while her right hand covered her vagina.</p></p>

<p><p>Naked and embarrassed, she continued to drift forward. Tyson was still floating to her while she just stared at him like a deer in headlights.</p></p>

<p><p>Finally, Faith was in reach and he embraced her, wrapping his arms around her lower back. His cheek was touching hers, and he put his face into her hair. He can smell her skin and her hair and she smelled good.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was still in shock...but his body was warm and inviting. She forgot about her embarrassment, and returned the embrace. &ldquo;Ty...Tyson!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They let go slightly and looked at each other in the eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry it took so long...Did that bastard hurt you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tyson...&rdquo; she said, her eyes shaking. &ldquo;I waited for you all this time...it was so painful...without you...&rdquo; Her voice was quivering and her eyes show deep sadness. Her words, her eyes and her voice pierced his heart with guilt. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if you were going to show up...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson felt guilty. He did not know how to respond...all he can say was &ldquo;I promise, I&rsquo;ll never let you go.&rdquo;</p></p>
