<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="star_a">[ A ] - Part 1 </span></p></center>

<p><p>These two sayans were walking along the banks of the lake, going to where ever they were going to. One was taller than the other by a head, and they both had on sayan suits and scouters.</p></p>

<p><p>They started chatting, bragging about their last battle.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Boy, that sure was easy, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It sure was. Those weaklings were no match for us.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah they were so weak they couldn&rsquo;t even hurt a fly.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They laughed. Suddenly a metallic creature appeared in front of them. &ldquo;Wanna share with me what&rsquo;s so funny?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They stopped laughing. &ldquo;What the? Who are you? What are you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My name is StarBlaster. Pleased to meet you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You must have a death wish, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; the shorter sayan said. &ldquo;Do you know who we are?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes. A bunch of pathetic sayans.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; the taller one said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Arrrgh. You&rsquo;re asking for it, pal.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>StarBlaster didn&rsquo;t move.</p></p>

<p><p>The two sayans fired a beam at the creature and an explosion occurred. Smoke covered the area. The sayans laughed an grinned, thinking they have won.</p></p>

<p><p>But the smoke cleared and the creature was still there, unharmed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;W-What?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>StarBlaster: &ldquo;Bye bye.&rdquo; Bam! He pointed a finger at them and fired. The sayans screamed like hell as the blast finished them off.</p></p>

<p><p>Several years after this event, on the planet they call earth...</p></p>

<p><p>The little kids fought each other in the backyard. Tyson and Nebula hit each other with their martial arts moves, and it was only a play-fight. Tyke was smiling as he blocked and hit his brother playfully. Then they soared into the air and continued to hit each other.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Kids!&rdquo; Margrit yelled.</p></p>

<p><p>They slowly descended, and grew disappointed knowing their fun was over.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How many times have I told you. Don&rsquo;t use your powers when you&rsquo;re out of the house! What if some one sees you? Don&rsquo;t ever use it unless you really need to.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes mom.&rdquo; they both answered.</p></p>

<p><p>She grabbed them by the ears and pulled them into the house.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ow ow ow ow...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ow ow ow ow...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s dinner time! Now get in the house.&rdquo; she said, dragging them.</p></p>

<p><p>Meanwhile...inside a spaceship named the Battalion II...</p></p>

<p><p>The alien creature wagged its tail as he stared at the earth from the large, round window that was most of the wall. It was <strong>Starburst</strong>! It&rsquo;s been a while since he was heard from, since his death. Many years have passed since that event, but painful memories lingered like spikes. He had that blasted Mason right where he wanted him, blind and helpless. But he was defeated anyway, despite his opponent&rsquo;s disability. Such a humiliating defeat, he thought. But now times have changed. He&rsquo;s the new Starburst. Well, physically, not symbolically. His skin was replaced with a shiny metallic armor that looked invulnerable. His head spikes were also covered in armor, and so was his face. He had been rebuilt, but he&rsquo;s the same old Starburst. His red eyes glared angrily.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We finally made it to earth. This is the planet we&rsquo;re going to ruin?&rdquo; said <strong>RidQuaiser</strong>, one of two of Starburst&rsquo;s servants. He was wearing a light brown overcoat and black pants and fighting boots. There was a scar on his left hand from battle. He was holding a really big blade weapon on his other hand.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Seems such a waste.&rdquo; <strong>Titus</strong> said. He was an average looking fighter with a red scouter on his eye. He had on fighting gloves and shoulder pads, making him look very tough.</p></p>

<p><p>Starburst: &ldquo;Bah! It&rsquo;s better off destroyed. This place brings back so much bad memories.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My dear son, is this where that Mason is? The one warrior who defeated you?&rdquo; <strong>StarBlaster</strong> asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, father. The only man who defeated me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>StarBlaster: &ldquo;Then I think we should meet this sayan warrior. I&rsquo;d love to meet him. He might prove to be a worthy opponent. Let&rsquo;s pay him and his family a little visit, what do you say?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Starburst: &ldquo;Sounds like a fine idea.&rdquo; If his real mouth were still here, he would be smiling.</p></p>

<p><p>Knock knock. Terry opened the door, and Julian and Lisa came in. &ldquo;Hey Julian!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hey guys!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yay! It&rsquo;s Julian.&rdquo; Tyson said happily.</p></p>

<p><p>Julian: &ldquo;Time to go to the park today.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;Alright.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lisa: &ldquo;Are you all set?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;You bet they are.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Oh yeah, make sure they get plenty of healthy foods.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Julian: &ldquo;Gotcha.&rdquo; She took the three kids and left the apartment.</p></p>

<p><p>A moment later, Margrit said: &ldquo;Oh Terry...now that the kids are gone, we have the place all to ourselves.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Gee, what can we do?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ohhh I have something in mind. Are you thinking what I&rsquo;m thinking?&rdquo; She put her arms around his neck.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I hope not. I was thinking of selling the place.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She laughed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a joker.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They kissed for a very long time. Then he started to unzip her dress.</p></p>

<p><p>Julian and the kids had tons of fun in the park. They ate some ice cream, and some cotton candy, and some other stuff. They met a clown there and he showed them all kinds of neat stuff, like folding a balloon into animals, pulling a rabbit out of his hat, and pulling flowers out of his sleeve. He even let Lisa squeeze his red nose.</p></p>

<p><p>StarBlaster: &ldquo;Look at all those tall buildings. Why did they make it that way?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Starburst: &ldquo;So they can be destroyed.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>RidQaiser: &ldquo;I must admit. These earthlings did a pretty good job building so much of these.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Titus: &ldquo;Well, they don&rsquo;t need that many. Let&rsquo;s get rid of some of these.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>RidQaiser: &ldquo;Agreed.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Starburst: &ldquo;I will do the honors. Now, let&rsquo;s see.&rdquo; He moved his forefinger at the buildings, deciding which one to blow up. &ldquo;How about this one?&rdquo; He pointed at this really tall tower. Then he gathered energy into his finger.</p></p>

<p><p>Terry and Margrit were sleeping together, naked, under the blanket. They both woke up and smiled at each other. Her head was on his chest her arms were around him. Terry touched her hair and pulled her pony tail.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ouch. Don&rsquo;t touch that.&rdquo; she said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oops, sorry.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My hair is very important, you know.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I wonder how the kids are doing.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be fine fine with Julian.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Do you think Nebula and Tyson will get along?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Of course they will. Those kids are best friends.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I just worry sometimes...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You mean...no, Tyson won&rsquo;t mind that. They&rsquo;ll be the best of brothers.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, they heard a distant explosion.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; Terry asked in surprise.</p></p>

<p><p>From the window, they could see a really big red sphere of destruction that engulfed many buildings. Terry quickly put on his pants and stood in front of the window, which was next to the bed. A red hemisphere formed and was getting bigger. Even the sky grew darker from its power. Margrit wrapped the blanket around her and went to the window. They were shocked by what they saw.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;What in the world?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;I can feel an evil presence in the area...it&rsquo;s very powerful. I&rsquo;m going to check it out.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Wait for me!&rdquo;</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="star_b">[ B ] - Part 2 </span></p></center>

<p><p>Julian and Tyson and Nebula heard it too. In fact, most of the city heard the explosion and saw it. Many of the them panicked and ran like hell.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Kids, you stay here. I&rsquo;ll go check out what is happening.&rdquo; She ran towards that direction.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oops. I guess I shot too much.&rdquo; Starburst said as the building collapsed.</p></p>

<p><p>All the bad dudes laughed sinisterly.</p></p>

<p><p>RidQuaiser: &ldquo;You sure recked that one.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They stopped laughing when they saw two people from the sky. Terry and Margarita landed in front of them on the same roof.</p></p>

<p><p>Starburst: &ldquo;Mason...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;Starburst?&rdquo; He was in quite a shock. This old face was not a good face to see.</p></p>

<p><p>Starburst: &ldquo;Long time no see, my dear friend.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Titus: &ldquo;This is the once great Mason?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire and Julian joined the heroes and for a while the two sides stared at each other.</p></p>

<p><p>Zell: &ldquo;...Uhhh...this is bad news!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Julian: &ldquo;Tell me about it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The eight warriors knew a big fight was about to happen, and they got ready.</p></p>

<p><p>RidQuaiser was standing on a platform, holding his sword with his hand and hung over his shoulder. &ldquo;Hmmmph. It&rsquo;s his other friends here. They&rsquo;re on a suicide mission.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Titus was sitting down on another, platform, crossing his arms. &ldquo;These earth people don&rsquo;t look so tough.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>StarBlaster: &ldquo;So, we finally meet, great warrior. I&rsquo;ve heard so much about you from my son. You&rsquo;re the only one to defeat him.&rdquo; His facial features looked just like Starburst, but his armor was green and his head spikes were bigger, and he was much taller. He had only three toes on his foot, like a monkey&rsquo;s.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;And let me guess...you&rsquo;re here to take revenge?&rdquo; Terry asked, already knowing the answer. He was wearing a blue shirt and blue sweats, and a red belt around his waist.</p></p>

<p><p>Next to him was Margarita, who was full of confidence. She had on her old combat suit, the tight black pants and black shirt, and a yellow life jacket.</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire was wearing white sweats, a white shirt, and he had a red band on his head.</p></p>

<p><p>Julian had a green shirt and a green skirt.</p></p>

<p><p> Starburst: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been given second chance! And I will use it to destroy you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit crossed her arms and tilted her head. &ldquo;Hmmph. They want to challenge us. They don&rsquo;t have what it takes. Isn&rsquo;t that right?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>StarBlaster: &ldquo;Ooh, we have an aggresive one.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>RidQuaiser: &ldquo;They actually think they can beat us. What foolishness.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;You just want me, Starburst. Why did you have to go and destroy that building?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Starburst: &ldquo;I will destroy you and your friends and the planet that you live on!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t allow it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire: &ldquo;Pyschos.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Enough is enough. Time to show you big mouths what a real sayan can do.&rdquo; Margrit powered up and her white energy flared.</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;Now&rsquo;s now the time to be a hothead!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She flew at them and was about to atttack. Starburst jumped out of the way. Rid and Titus flew forward and went pass her. Now in front of her was StarBlaster, and he charged at her. They hit each other crazily and the others began to fight. Of course, Starburst took on Mason, Rid took on Julian, and Titus took Zelfire.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;Tyson, something is not right.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;Uhhh...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;I can feel four energy forces I don&rsquo;t recognize. And they&rsquo;re very powerful.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;I can feel it too.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;We better check it out.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Lisa: &ldquo;Guys, what about me?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;You just stay put.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The super kids flew towards the battle field to help their parents.</p></p>

<p><p>Terry and Starburst hit each other&rsquo;s face, then backed away. Terry punched, missed, and got kicked by Starburst&rsquo;s lethal foot.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You will pay for what you did to me!&rdquo; the alien yelled. He wagged his tail angrily.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You deserved it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They charged into each other and punched in the cheeks. Pow! They dug their fists into each other&rsquo;s cheeks and grunted for a good two seconds, then let go. Then they blasted each other.</p></p>

<p><p>On the ruined streets, RidQuaiser slashed his blade and Julian dodged it. Whoosh! Whoosh!</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Careful. You might hurt some one with that thing.&rdquo; Julian said smartly.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the idea. I&rsquo;m going to chop you to pieces!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now that isn&rsquo;t a very nice thing to say.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He slashed. She dodged and punched his chest.</p></p>

<p><p>StarBlaster punched Margrit and she blocked with both arms. They were in the air, and he was pushing her further back. Pow! Pow! Pow! She dodged, and punched his face. Nothing happened. She expected him to flinch or something, but nothing. He didn&rsquo;t move at all. It didn&rsquo;t seem to affect him at all. She jabbed his chest, and kicked his hip, but nothing happened.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Uhhh...this can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He drew his fist back, and she knew it was coming. She crossed her arms over her face and his fist hit her and she fell down on the ground.</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire and Titus shot energy balls and energy beams at each other and hit some other things instead of their target. Street lights and cars were destroyed as they flew by and fired. Zelfire fired the Energy Blast, and Titus blurred and appeared in front of him. He punched Zell really hard and he struggled in the air to stop moving back.</p></p>

<p><p>Titus: &ldquo;StarBlaster was right about you earthlings. You&rsquo;re so pathetic.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zell wiped blood off his mouth. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you!&rdquo; He charged and they continued fighting.</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="star_c">[ C ] - Part 3 </span></p></center>

<p><p>&ldquo;Die Mason!&rdquo; Starburst shouted, firing a bunch of energy balls.</p></p>

<p><p>Terry dodged them skillfully and the balls destroyed the building behind him. Starburst charged and punched, Terry grabbed his fist and he punched, then Starburst grabbed his fist. They struggled in the air for a while. Terry suddenly remembered their previous fight, and how his eyes got injured...so he let go his hands and kneed Starburst in the chin. Then he punched him into a building. Crash!</p></p>

<p><p>The alien came back up angry. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t defeat me...no, not this time!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad...even after all that you still do not learn.&rdquo; he said calmly.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The only thing I&rsquo;ve learned is that I must kill you no matter what. I&rsquo;ve been defeated by a filthy sayan! Do you know how I felt all these years? The humiliation, the pain that stuck with me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You were asking for it, so I gave you what you deserved. Hmmmph. You never should have showed up at the colony.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Blast you sayan!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still the old Starburst I knew. You haven&rsquo;t changed a bit. You might be stronger now, but it doesn&rsquo;t make a difference to me.&rdquo; He gathered energy into his palms.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I will show you my superior powers!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry fired the Energy Blast, and Starburst blocked it effortlessly with one hand. Then he fired a bunch of star-shaped energy discs and Terry blocked with energy balls. A couple of small explosions came between them. Both of them went into the smoke and hit each other.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit powered up and fired a really powerful beam at the green armored alien. But still, StarBlaster wasn&rsquo;t hurt a bit. &ldquo;Arrrgh! Why won&rsquo;t you die?&rdquo; she said in frustration.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s amusing to watch a sayan try to fight a hopeless battle. All you sayan types are the same. When you want some thing done, you&rsquo;ll try to do it no matter what, even if it&rsquo;s impossible. So stubborn.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mistake to underestimate us sayans.&rdquo; Then she pointed her thumb at herself. &ldquo;Especially if it&rsquo;s me!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha ha!&rdquo; He charged at her and they continued fighting.</p></p>

<p><p>StarBlaster&rsquo;s armor was too strong...and of course Margarita couldn&rsquo;t find a way to hurt him. She was knocked into the ground, she not only fell, but her body was embedded into the street. She moaned painfully.</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;Margarita!&rdquo; He saw her fell and wanted to help, but he had his hands full.</p></p>

<p><p>Starburst: &ldquo;She was no match for my father.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry grunted angrily. His fists were like stones. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me you want. Leave my family and friends out of this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You know what? I&rsquo;m going to kill you and then I&rsquo;ll destroy this whole planet, and every body who lives on it will die with you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a psycho.&rdquo; he said with pure hatred.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I know. Isn&rsquo;t that wonderful? Ha ha ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They punched crazily.</p></p>

<p><p>Starburst kicked Terry&rsquo;s chest, and he struggled to stop falling. Mason almost hit the ground when he regained control of himself. Terry fired a beam, and he dodged it. Then Terry flew up and Starburst flew up, keeping distance. Suddenly Starburst flew down and punched Terry&rsquo;s face. Pow!</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now take this!&rdquo; The alien formed a star-shaped disc as he raised his arms. The disc grew bigger and bigger as it got more energy, and it turned to the size of a stadium. &ldquo;Try and dodge this!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He threw the disc down and Terry didn&rsquo;t know what to do. It was too late to dodge, it was too big to fly around. He decided to risk it and blow a hole through it. Starburst laughed sinisterly as he gathered energy. He fired the Ultra Blast at the disc and blew a hole through it! The disc broke apart and fragments of it hit Terry and knocked him down. Other fragments hit the street and cracked it, others hit cars and broke windows.</p></p>

<p><p>He got back up, and powered up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never let you win!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My dear friend, I&rsquo;ve already won.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry soared up and punched. Starburst dodged, and Terry punched left, then he dodged, then he punched right, he dodged and kicked Terry&rsquo;s chest, then punched his face really hard. Mason landed on the ground next to Margrit.</p></p>

<p><p>Things definitely didn&rsquo;t look good for them now.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit, barely conscious, grabbed the dirt. &ldquo;Terry...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Margrit...we mustn&rsquo;t give up yet.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We have to get up!!! It&rsquo;s never over yet. We have to do it...&rdquo; Terry painfully stood up, and breathed hard. Bruises were on his face and blood dripped from his mouth. His shirt and pants had holes and there were scratches. He said to the aliens: &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t won yet!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Starburst: &ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s the spirit.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit then got up, and stood firm. Her fighting suit was completely messed up. There was a bruise on her face and forehead. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll destroy all of you...&rdquo; she mumbled.</p></p>

<p><p>StarBlaster let out a yell and charged and punched Terry&rsquo;s stomach, pushing him into a wall. Crash!</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit flew at Starburst and attacked.</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire was down on the ground, and Titus was about to blast him. Suddenly, an energy beam hit his back and burned his suit. &ldquo;Ouch! Who dares?&rdquo; He turned around and saw the super kids.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;You deserved that one. Leave our friend alone.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;Yeah, creep!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Titus: &ldquo;You little punks need to learn some manners.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He and the two boys punched each other many times, then Zelfire shouted: &ldquo;Let me take care of this.&rdquo; They looked at him. &ldquo;I can do this alone.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;Alright then. Let&rsquo;s go help our parents.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;Ok.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The kids flew away.</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Titus: &ldquo;Fine.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They powered up to the fullest.</p></p>

<p><p>The kids flew to the other side of the city and saw Starburst shooting lasers from his eyes, and his target was their mother! Margrit ran like hell to avoid the deadly lasers. They hit the ground and zap! A piece of it burned. Starburst had good aim, but Margrit was fast enough to not get hit. But she got unlucky and the lasers hit her back and she collapsed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mommy!&rdquo; Tyson yelled instinctively.</p></p>

<p><p>Starburst saw two kids floating in the air and went towards them.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;Are you ready, Tyson?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do it.</p></p>

<p><p>Starburst and the two kids fought in the air, beating the crap out of each other. Nebula decided to use teamwork. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give him what we go, Tyke!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The kids charged up energy and fired beams, and the beams combined into a stronger beam and Starburst knocked it away like a fly. He shot eye lasers and almost hit them. Tyson dived kicked his face, and Nebula punched his chest. Pow! Starburst regained control, then Nebula charged. Starburst punched, Nebula dodged and kicked his stomach.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Arrrgh. I won&rsquo;t let two shrimps get in my way.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Grrrr. Try my Target Energy Bomb!&rdquo; Nebula said. He opened his palm gathered energy as his left hand held his right wrist to hold the energy steadily. A small orb formed, then it grew big. He tossed the ball at the alien.</p></p>

<p><p>Starburst fired mini star discs and Nebula motioned his fingers, and the ball avoided the discs. The ball headed straight for him. Starburst got ready to block, then the ball flew up, and he was surprised. Then the ball came down and hit him and blew up. Kaboom! Tyson and Nebula kept on firing streams of energy balls at the explosion non-stop. When tired, they stopped and breathed hard.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;Did we get him?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Starburst showed up as the smoke cleared.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula drew his sword and charged. Slash! Slash! He missed. Starburst grabbed his sword and kicked him down. Tyson charged and punched. Starburst blocked him and grabbed Tyson by his shirt.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heeeelp!&rdquo; screamed the little warrior.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;Put him down.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Here you go.&rdquo; He threw Tyson away and shot eye lasers.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula formed a shield and blocked the lasers for his brother just in time. Tyson was falling and he fell on the floor. &ldquo;Tyson!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha ha.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Nebula Blast!&rdquo; the kid shouted. He fired the blast at Starburst, who formed a star shield around himself. The blast broke apart as it touched him. &ldquo;No...my most powerful move...&rdquo; Nebula couldn&rsquo;t believe it. What could he do now?</p></p>

<p><p>Starburst charged and whacked the poor kid with his tail. Wham! Nebula fell onto the skyscraper with a loud crash. Now Tyson was all by himself. The alien approached him. &ldquo;Uhh...mommy...daddy? Nebula?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Uhhh poor poor child. All alone now with no one to help you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson gulped and swallowed hard.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So, son of Mason, your time is up. Your father made me look like a fool, and I&rsquo;ll get revenge on him and his precious family.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson just remembered something his mommy told him earlier...a true warrior never shows fear, even if he is scared. So, the kid took a deep breath and spilled his guts out. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m...I&rsquo;m not scared of you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oooh, what a brave young lad.&rdquo; the alien said sarcastically.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit ran quickly, sensing her son was in danger.</p></p>

<p><p>Starburst charged and punched, and Tyson screamed and blocked. He dodged desperately as the alien attacked with his tail. Whoosh! Tyson punched, Starburst dodged, then elbowed him in the chest. Ouch. He shot eye lasers and hit him. Zap! Margrit ran down the street, just in time to see her son get shot. &ldquo;NO!!! Tyson!&rdquo; The kid was unconscious and he fell down. Margrit ran to the right spot, opened her arms, and caught her fallen son. He looked like a baby in her arms, and he was hurt. She felt sad and worthless, to let this happen to her son. &ldquo;My Tyson...my son...my only son...&rdquo; Suddenly, she glared at Starburst and her face showed extreme anger. She gently placed him on the nearest car. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be alright. Let me take care of things.&rdquo;</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="star_d">[ D ] - Part 4 </span></p></center>

<p><p>Titus: &ldquo;Die!&rdquo; He fired a bunch of fire balls and Zelfire ran to dodge them.</p></p>

<p><p>He jumped up and punched Titus. Pow! Then he charged and made a kick. Titus dodged and Zell&rsquo;s foot hit a wall, cracking it. Titus fired an energy beam, and Zelfire disappeared, and reappeared in front of him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s over for you!&rdquo; Titus gasped and Zell fired the Energy Blast right in his face. Zap! Titus&rsquo;s scouter broke and he was knocked into the ground and exploded.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How pitiful...&rdquo; the alien said in a mocking tone.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Starburst, you have gone too far this time. You never should have messed with my son.&rdquo; Margrit ascended to his altitude and powered up fiercely.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, soon all of you will feel the pain I have felt!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You...you&rsquo;re despicable!!!&rdquo; Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzt...Her body released enormous amounts of energy and white electric sparks surrounded her. She was really angry now.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Pow! She punched him right in the cheek.</p></p>

<p><p>He touched his face and couldn&rsquo;t believe it. &ldquo;Never get a sayan angry! Especially if it&rsquo;s me!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Starburst charged and punched, and she grabbed his fist with a loud smacking sound. The alien was surprised that she could block it and gasped as she crushed his fingers. &ldquo;You...uhhh...uhhh...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You never should&rsquo;ve messed with my son.&rdquo; she said calmly. She let go of his fist and kicked him in the chest and he fell into a skyscraper.</p></p>

<p><p>Starburst recovered angrily and grunted. He fired three streams of star discs at her and she swayed side to side, dodging them. &ldquo;Arrrgh!&rdquo; He fired a powerful beam, and she knocked it away.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re finished.&rdquo; She gave him a dive kick and they both went into the skyscraper.</p></p>

<p><p>They fought and fought and the skyscraper exploded, and only they were left, floating in the air as the chucks fell. Starburst charged at her, and she kneed him in the guts and pounded his back, and he slammed into the street. She dived kicked at him and he dodged. He fired eye lasers and she flew and dodged them, and fired an energy ball. He blocked but it was too powerful and knocked him backwards. Boom!</p></p>

<p><p>Starburst kept on trying, but he wasn&rsquo;t doing very well. &ldquo;This can&rsquo;t be! I will not be defeated! I&rsquo;m the third strongest warrior in the universe.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Third strongest?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. You&rsquo;re nothing compared to me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s waaaaaay wrong. If your father is stronger than you, then you&rsquo;re the fourth strongest.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;See? First is Terry, then me, then StarBlaster, then you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Arrrgh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tsk tsk tsk. You were misled all this time. Did you forget who defeated you? Oh yes, I remember now. It was Terry, also known as Mason.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Bam! Starburst fired a beam at her, and it did nothing. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now I remember something...it was you who washed Terry&rsquo;s memories back at the colony. And you killed his father. And I had to spend some time in the healing chamber. When I was in there, I swore to make the person responsible pay. And now it&rsquo;s your time to suffer my wrath!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The alien was really worried, and pissed off.</p></p>

<p><p>Julian and RidQuaiser got ready as they stood opposite each other on the street. Suddenly, without a warning, they charged. Zoom! RidQuaiser slashed with his big blade and Julian made a super punch. They went pass each other and stopped. A few moments passed by, and both of them were confident they had hit their opponent. The wind blew hard, and RidQuaiser dropped his blade. Clang clan! &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not bad...&rdquo; he collapsed. Julian silently stood there, not moving at all.</p></p>

<p><p>Terry and StarBlaster were hitting each other in the air, but Terry just couldn&rsquo;t do any damage to StarBlaster. He had to figure out a way to break through his armor and that&rsquo;s the only way. Whack! Terry was knocked into the ground.</p></p>

<p><p>Starburst continued to struggle with Margarita, but he was losing badly. He was so frustrated he formed a gigantic star shaped disc and sent it to her. It flew horizontally at her and she fired the Wrath Beam and broke it. The beam hit Starburst and pushed him into the sky.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aaaah! Blast you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Are you mad that a sayan got the better of you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Starburst charged at her and punched her face. She just looked at him fiercely.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it huh? That&rsquo;s all you got?&rdquo; Pow! She punched him and knocked him away. She fired the Wrath Beam and blew him up completely.</p></p>

<p><p>Wham! Terry got slammed into a building and came out the other side. He tried to control himself in the air and finally managed to stop falling.</p></p>

<p><p>StarBlaster: &ldquo;Ha ha ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry gave him a super duper combo attack, but nothing hurt him. &ldquo;Darn it! He must have a weakness.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Are you done yet?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry fired the Energy Blast, and the alien blocked it. Suddenly, Julian showed up to help. She attacked the alien&rsquo;s head and didn&rsquo;t hurt him. StarBlaster knocked her away with a smack. Terry charged, and got hit. Bam! A beam hit StarBlaster&rsquo;s back. He turned around and saw Zelfire.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Uh oh.&rdquo; Zell said.</p></p>

<p><p>StarBlaster fired a star beam at him and hit him. Zap!</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;No!&rdquo; He charged at him and attacked ferociously.</p></p>

<p><p>Then Margrit showed up and helped him.</p></p>

<p><p>StarBlaster: &ldquo;No! I can&rsquo;t believe my son was defeated. Oh well, he was worthless anyways. I have no use for such a worthless imbecile.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your son you&rsquo;re talking about! How could you say such a thing!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The two sayans kept on attacking StarBlaster, who just stayed there, not moving, not even blinking, letting them hit him.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Wham! She got hit in the face and fell on the street. Bam! Terry got punched in the guts.</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gotta figure out a way to get through his armor!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>StarBlaster fired a finger beam, and Terry dodged. Then he charged and used the Power Punch. StarBlaster blocked with his wrist, but his armor cracked. &ldquo;What?! How dare you!&rdquo; He flew at Terry and pushed him, and they both went into the ground. Crash!</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Terry...&rdquo; Margarita mumbled as she laid there.</p></p>

<p><p>Two holes appeared on the floor as the warriors flew out. They hit each other many times, then Terry managed to hit his face. Pow!</p></p>

<p><p>StarBlaster: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! You&rsquo;re finished!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry gathered energy for the Death Star and absorbed it into his hands. StarBlaster fired a beam and hit Terry! Smoke appeared. Terry was on the floor and his clothes were really messed up.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hahahahahahaha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Luckily, Terry had already finished absorbing the energy he needed. And now, in the air, they were staring at each other. Suddenly, they charged at each other. StarBlaster punched, Terry ducked and put his palms together. BOOOM! StarBlaster blew up as Terry went pass him. The only remains of him were particles of dust, and they fell down.</p></p>

<p><p>The wreckage of the battle was enormous. Terry, injured and tired, stumbled down the road, and smoke was all around him, covering up everything else. It was like a mist. The floor that used to be even now had cracks everywhere and rock chunks. In front of him stood Margarita, more than glad to see him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I finished off StarBlaster. We have nothing more to worry about.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They walked towards each other and Terry started to fall. She caught him in her arms and they fell on their knees. She put his head on her chest and comforted him. &ldquo;Terry...&rdquo;</p></p>




<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="unc_love">Unconditional love</span></p></center>

<p><p>Unconditional love</p></p>

<p> <p><a name=&quot;UL_A&quot;></a>Unconditional Love</p></p>

<p> <p>Margarita was walking with her two sons, holding them by the hand, one on each side of her. Little Tyke and little Neb just got out of school and their mother was taking them to see their father.</p></p>

<p><p>With his little schoolbag on, Tyke was jumping up and down happily. &ldquo;Are we going to see daddy?&rdquo; he asked.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Yep. He is meditating by the pond.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyke: &ldquo;Yay! We&rsquo;re going to see daddy! We&rsquo;re going to see daddy!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Neb: &ldquo;Can we go out for ice cream today?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Sure. Let&rsquo;s go get your father first.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They arrived at the pond and Terry was there, meditating in front of the waterfall.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Daddy!&rdquo; Tyson shouted with his hands on his mouth. &ldquo;Daddy!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry opened his eyes and got up. &ldquo;Oh hey there.&rdquo; He blurred and appeared in front of them. &ldquo;Hey there kids.&rdquo; He touched the kids&rsquo; shoulders.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyke: &ldquo;Mom said we could go out for ice cream.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ice cream? Sounds great. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Neb: &ldquo;And today is the first day of summer vacation.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Yep. It&rsquo;s going to be a whole summer of fun.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yay!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Hiding behind one of the bushes was some one or some thing watching their movements. It saw everything in shades of green and their voices sounded like echoes to the watcher.</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita took the kids to a medium class restaurant, and Terry had some thing to do so he had to go and promised he would join them later.</p></p>

<p><p>The waitress came and awaited their order. &ldquo;How may I help you today?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Gimme two ice creams. Chocolate and vanilla flavor. And a soup for me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Right away.&rdquo; She into the kitchen.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyke: &ldquo;When is daddy coming?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be here with you soon. He says he has some thing important to do.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Inside the restaurant, the watcher was still watching them. The family was sitting on the table by the window, the one with the cushioned seats. Beep beep beep. The watcher scanned their power levels.</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita: 60,070...Tyson: 3,250...Nebula: 4,060.</p></p>

<p><p>Their food finally came. The waitress handed them their order and went away. &ldquo;About time. The service here stinks.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Neb and Tyke licked their ice cream deliciously. &ldquo;Oh mom, the food&rsquo;s not that bad.&rdquo; Neb said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Some people should do things faster.&rdquo; She took a sip of her soup. &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re right about one thing. At least the soup is good.&rdquo; She took another sip.</p></p>

<p><p>On the other side of the restaurant, a stranger dressed in an overcoat came in. A waitress went to him and asked, &ldquo;Can I help you, sir?&rdquo; She saw his face was the face of a robot and she screamed.</p></p>

<p><p>On one of the tables, an old man suddenly got up and flipped the table. He ripped off his skin, revealing his robotic self. A woman saw him and screamed and backed away. More and more mechbots revealed themselves, and headed towards the Spade table. The guy by the cashier ducked and hid like a coward. Others ran out the exit.</p></p>

<p><p>The family did not even notice it until one of the mechbots approached within a few feet. Neb turned and saw it. &ldquo;Uhhh...mom...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyke: &ldquo;Mom...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita was still drinking her soup calmly. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Neb: &ldquo;Robots are coming!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I see that. At least let me finish my soup.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyke: &ldquo;Mom...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The mechbot got closer.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mom!&rdquo; Neb yelled.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost finished.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The mechbot slammed the table, cracking it in half, and the soup bowl broke apart and the soup spilled. The kids gasped and remained frozen.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit was still holding the spoon, and she crushed it in her hand. &ldquo;Alright, now I&rsquo;m mad.&rdquo; She got up and shoved the spoon into the robot&rsquo;s one eye, blinding it. It stuttered crazily and she gave it a good punch. Pow! It hit the wall like a trash can. Another one was coming at her. She ran and kicked it in the face, and its head fell off. The headless body exploded.</p></p>

<p><p>A mechbot was approaching Tyke and he was stepping back. Its left hand turned into a gun and shot a laser. Zap! Tyke jumped up and punched its eye. Cram! It fell and Tyke jumped on it like a trampoline. &ldquo;Take that!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula drew his sword and slashed the robots with skillful aim. Slash! Quang! Cling! A mechbot lost its head, another lost an arm, and another had its body chopped in half.</p></p>

<p><p> A mechbot was behind and another was in front of Margrit. With danger on both sides, her eyeballs scrolled to the back, then to the front. The mechbot behind made a punch, Margrit ducked, turned around, and sweeped it. She jumped up and spun in the air like a ball, then landed on a table. A mechbot ran at her and she kicked it away. Another one shot a laser at the table. Zap! She jumped off and kicked its head. Another came at her, and she made a roundhouse kick on its head and it went flying backwards, landing on another mechbot.</p></p>

<p><p>Terry came in and his mouth was wide open as he saw the sight. Robots every where and his family was in danger!</p></p>

<p><p>He joined the fight against the robots and soon enough they were all destroyed.</p></p>

<p><p>They didn&rsquo;t knew it, but a small, flying robot eye was watching them all this time. It recorded all their fighting data and sent it to its master.</p></p>

<p><p>Meanwhile, inside a giant spherical ship, Coal sat by the screen, analyzing the data. His fingers were folded together as he examined it. &ldquo;Ooh, they have such high power levels. This should be interesting. I can&rsquo;t wait to meet these sayans.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly a red light appeared and he pressed a button on the control panel. Beep. The screen showed a bunch of police forces around him.</p></p>

<p><p>The police forces have surrounded him on all sides. They were ready to fire on command.</p></p>

<p><p>Coal: &ldquo;This is not the time for this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The chief of police appeared on the screen. &ldquo;Listen up alien, you are trespassing into earth. You are violating the intergalactic space code and we are here to stop you. You are surrounded, so I suggest you surrender.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Surrender? Are you kidding me? I would rather die than surrender.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You have ten seconds to surrender. If you do not, then we will use force on you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Go ahead then.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The sphere shot a laser and destroyed one of the police cruisers. Kabam! It blew up and turned into a fireball. The chief knew he wasn&rsquo;t going to give up. &ldquo;Fire at will!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>All the cruisers fired lasers non-stop. The sphere was getting heavily damaged.</p></p>

<p><p>Coal got into an escape jet and flew away. &ldquo;So long, suckers.&rdquo; The sphere exploded and destroyed every thing within a five mile radius. BOOOOOOM! The police never had a chance. Their bodies and the cruisers disintegrated within seconds.</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;What was all that about.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;I know those robots were after me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who could be out to get you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I have a lot of enemies who want me dead. And now one of them has found me here. Ohhh this is all my fault. We&rsquo;re all in danger because of me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...don&rsquo;t say that.&rdquo; He put his hands on her shoulders. He tried to comfort her but it wasn&rsquo;t working. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your fault.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes it is. It&rsquo;s all my fault!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t think such things. Right now we have to protect the kids.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. They shouldn&rsquo;t be in this mess...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson and Nebula was overhearing their conversation and he broke in. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need your protection. I&rsquo;m just another person you have to watch over! You don&rsquo;t need me!&rdquo; He ran out the door.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Wait Nebula!&rdquo; She chased him outside and he flew away. She watched him disappear into the sky.</p></p>

<p><p>Terry came and joined her, then Tyson came.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;What is up with him?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;I think I know how he feels. Think about it if you were in his position. He feels like he&rsquo;s just an outsider in the way. An extra person that has to be protected.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit became silent.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;Is he going to come back?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Inside the airplane, Coal was planning to find a place to hide, but his scanners picked up some thing. It was Nebula, one of the children of Margrit. Well, this must be his lucky day, he thought. He didn&rsquo;t even have to search for him. Once he gets the kid, Margarita will come looking for him.</p></p>

<p><p>In the mountainous area, Nebula ran and ran. He didn&rsquo;t know where to go. He had no home to go to. He didn&rsquo;t consider the Spades house his home. His true home was planet Nebula. It was always and forever will be. Nothing can change that. He had no real family. He did not need any protection.</p></p>

<p><p>He stopped on the way and couldn&rsquo;t hold it anymore. He cried sadly and let every thing out. Floods of tears filled his eyes and spilled, and he sobbed. He wiped his eyes but the tears kept coming. A true warrior never cries, he remembered his mother once saying. But any body with a heart and conscience can cry, no matter how strong.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Nebula!&rdquo; shouted a kid&rsquo;s voice from behind.</p></p>

<p><p>Neb turned around and Tyke was running at him. &ldquo;Tyson?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Nebula!&rdquo; He stopped and panted for breath. &ldquo;I found you at last.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a stupid question. To look for you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Tyson. I just don&rsquo;t belong with your family. I&rsquo;m not your brother.&rdquo; He ran.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson ran after him. &ldquo;Wait! Wait!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Neb stopped. &ldquo;Stop coming after me!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I said I don&rsquo;t belong with your family! I&rsquo;m just don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re my brother.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Neb didn&rsquo;t respond.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I love you. Mom and dad loves you. We need you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, bro.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You have every reason to belong with us! Every reason in the whole world. You have done so much for us, don&rsquo;t you remember? It was you who helped us fight Bane. Mom would never have survived without you. And I never forgot a single thing you taught me during our training. You made me what I am today. Without you, I would just be defenseless and not be what I am today.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula was holding a fist and he closed his eyes painfully. His back was facing Tyke, but Tyke knew he was having a hard time. He had done every thing he can, he really did. What else could he do to get his brother back? Finally, Neb responded. &ldquo;Mother and father are sayans!&rdquo; he bursted out. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re a sayan. But I&rsquo;m a Nebulan. We&rsquo;re not a family! We don&rsquo;t belong together!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A black airplane appeared in the sky and fired at the kids. Bang bang bang! The bullets hit the ground and the sand sprouted up, separating Tyke and Neb.</p></p>

<p><p>Neb: &ldquo;Tyson!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Coal: &ldquo;Almost gotcha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He fired again and Tyson ran for his life. He flew up and fired an energy ball at the plane, and Coal&rsquo;s expert flying skills allowed him to dodge it. It fired more bullets and Tyson dodged in the air. A net came out of the plane&rsquo;s bottom and caught Tyson. Neb flew up and dodged the bullets as he got closer. He took out his sword and cut Tyson free. The plane fired a laser and hit Tyson. He was falling fast. Nebula went after his brother, and the plane flew in front of him. He fired a energy ball at the plane&rsquo;s wing. Boom! The wing was damaged and the plane crashed into the ground. Tyson fell into the ground as well.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit and Terry ran towards the kids. Tyson was unconscious and badly hurt. Nebula was with him, feeling guilty about what happened.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Tyson...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry picked up his son. &ldquo;He needs some rest.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. It was all my fault.&rdquo; He ran away.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit ran after him.</p></p>

<p><p>They ended up in a valley and were still running. Nebula saw she was catching up and he flew up. But just a few feet from the ground Margarita grabbed his foot and dragged him down and slammed him down. For a few moments, they breathed hard, not saying anything to each other. They needed the time to get calm.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;What do you think you&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let me go. I don&rsquo;t belong with you. I don&rsquo;t belong in the family.&rdquo; He got up and his head was facing down.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I want to ask you some thing. And I want an honest answer from you. Have I been a good mother? What did I do wrong as a guardian? I gave you food, shelter and clothes. I gave you the love and care any kid deserves. Why are you doing this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not you, mother. Don&rsquo;t you see...no matter what happens, I&rsquo;m a Nebulan, and nothing can ever change that.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. Nothing can change that fact. But we&rsquo;re happy together, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well...yes.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Neb, don&rsquo;t you see that we all love you very very much? That&rsquo;s all that matters, isn&rsquo;t it? Love is what makes a family.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I guess so.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter where you came from, Neb. We might be of a different race, but that doesn&rsquo;t bother me one bit.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You mean...it doesn&rsquo;t matter? You don&rsquo;t care at all?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the greatness of unconditional love, kid. It&rsquo;s loving some one for who he is, not caring about anything else. No matter what the conditions are, I&rsquo;ll still love you. You will always be my son. I&rsquo;ve treated you like my own son all along. I love you and Tyson equally the same.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t hold back the tears and they spilled out. He ran to her and she bent down and hugged him tightly.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;See, it isn&rsquo;t that bad.&rdquo; she said as they hugged.</p></p>

<p><p>They both flashed back to the same moment...</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tyson, I just wanted to know you&rsquo;re my best friend on the whole earth! Now that the crisis is over, I have to go.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Go where?&rdquo; he asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I...I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Nebula said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Kid...&rdquo; Margrit said. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have a home, do you? Come stay with us.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;With...you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson and Nebula and Mason were totally shocked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, you can be part of our family. We have room for one more son...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We sure do. You and Tyson can be brothers.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well, kid? Whaddaya say?&rdquo; she asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You...mean it?&rdquo; Nebula was on the verge of tears.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo; She bent down and hugged him as he ran to her. He cried, but this time it was tears of happiness.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; he said, sobbing.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly a beam came at them and hit Margrit on the shoulder. Wham! It knocked them both down.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; Neb yelled.</p></p>

<p><p>She winced. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright. Get outta here! Run!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Run damn it! Go!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He ran as fast as he could. He was gonna go tell his dad and then he&rsquo;ll go to help. He just hoped his mom would be alright.</p></p>

<p><p>She tried to comfort her bad shoulder, and it hurt a lot.</p></p>

<p><p>Coal laughed as he came.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t a damn bit funny.&rdquo; she snickered.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How careless you were. What happened to your sayan senses?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I know who you are, Margarita.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My name is Coal. It&rsquo;s nice to meet you. You&rsquo;re probably wondering why I attacked you. I&rsquo;m a sayan like you. A sayan elite warrior! I heard rumors there are some strong warriors here on earth, and it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m flattered.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Once I kill you, then I will be the strongest sayan alive.&rdquo; he said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy. You&rsquo;d kill me just to satisfy your own selfish ambitions.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Only I can be the ultimate sayan warrior. No one else.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She powered up, and white energy covered her body. Her white dress was waving and her hair was moving as she gathered energy. &ldquo;Let me ask you, what makes you think you can defeat me?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What makes you think you won&rsquo;t lose?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmmmph.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They ran into each other and began...</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula, though almost out of breath, ran to his father and stopped, panting.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Neb?&rdquo; he asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mother is in danger! Help her!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Without hesitating, the father and son ran towards the direction of the battle. While running, Terry asked: &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. He&rsquo;s a really strong guy.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Wham! Margrit was slammed into a wall and it seemed over for her. She had put up a good fight, but he was just as strong and fought with much intensity. It must have been the surprise attack on her shoulder, which partly paralyzed her right arm and caused much unnecessary pain. She grabbed her shoulder and breathed hard.</p></p>

<p><p>Coal: &ldquo;Any last words?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Go to hell.&rdquo; she said calmly.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I will, but not anytime soon.&rdquo; He opened his palm and gathered energy. Chuop! An energy ball formed.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit got up. She knew she was gonna lose, but what the heck. She might as well try. It&rsquo;s not gonna hurt that much, she thought hopefully.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Mason yelled, and Coal looked at him. He fired a beam and Coal dodged it just in time.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Another sayan? Ahh, you&rsquo;re Mason.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mason: &ldquo;What do you want with Margrit?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to kill us off. He&rsquo;s a psycho path.&rdquo; She got up, holding her shoulder, and stood next to her husband.</p></p>

<p><p>Coal: &ldquo;Psycho path? What is wrong with killing? sayans are a violent race, and we are all killers here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mason: &ldquo;Technically, you&rsquo;re right. But we don&rsquo;t fight for the same reasons you do. That is what separates the great from the cruel.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Coal: &ldquo;Cruelty is all part of war. What can I say? People have to die in order to make others great.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mason: &ldquo;That is where you&rsquo;re wrong. If you truly believe that, then I have nothing more to say to you. Leave me and my family alone, or defend yourself.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well, since you put it that way.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They prepared themselves. Coal charged at him and Mason got his arms ready. Coal punched, and he blocked. Pow! They hit each other with hard fists and some kicks.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula watched worriedly. He wasn&rsquo;t 100% sure that his surrogate father would win, and that worried him. He didn&rsquo;t know what Coal could do.</p></p>

<p><p>Crash! Mason was knocked into a wall and rock chunks flew all over the place. He was embedded into the rock, and it hurt like hell. Coal gathered energy and fired a beam. Puow! It hit him and pushed him out of the other side of the wall. Mason scraped against the ground and went under, leaving a trail. A bunch of energy comets flew at him. Mason quickly got back up and disappeared. He reappeared on top of Coal and kicked him. They hit each other again</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Terry!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Bam! Mason got hit by a beam and got kicked and whacked. Coal charged at him and he punched, missed, then dodged Mason&rsquo;s punch, then jabbed his guts. Then he gave an uppercut to his chin and Mason fell backwards(ouch).</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit ran towards the fallen hero and bent down to check on him. He moaned half-consciously. &ldquo;Leave him alone!&rdquo; she yelled.</p></p>

<p><p>Coal: &ldquo;How touching. Now you will die together. Got any last words?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Noooo!&rdquo; yelled Neb, who was hiding all this time.</p></p>

<p><p>He drew his sword and slashed violently. Coal dodged the blade easily like it was a routine. He punched the little warrior&rsquo;s chest and it was all he could take. Neb crashed on the ground like a pinball. He fired a bunch of energy balls that blasted the ground, and Neb was knocked away.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiie!&rdquo; She charged at him and made some karate chops and some punches, he dodged and whacked her down.</p></p>

<p><p>Mason got up and fired the Ultra Blast. Bam!</p></p>

<p><p>He blocked it, but with some damage. &ldquo;What an attack!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mason appeared in front of him and jabbed him in the face. He spit blood and was knocked totally senseless. When the fist was in his cheek, his mouth was totally out of place. Then Mason fired a beam, and at that close range it was a deadly attack. Zap! Coal was pushed back and hit the wall. His clothes were smoking and he had bruises on himself. He grunted angrily, and looked like he was gonna retaliate, but he fell down.</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita ran towards Terry and was about to hug him, but she accidently pushed him down and she fell on top of him. &ldquo;Terry!&rdquo; she said happily.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Whoa, aren&rsquo;t we a little excited?&rdquo; he said.</p></p>

<p><p>She kissed his lips and he kissed back. As they continued kissed passionately, they were touching each other&rsquo;s face.</p></p>

<p><p>Her hair fell on his face and he said: &ldquo;Ummm, your hair is on my face.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She smiled and laughed and put her hair on her back. Then they continued kissing. Terry touched her face, then her hair, then her shoulder, and she winced. &ldquo;Ouch.&rdquo; She winced.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m sorry. Does it hurt?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;A little bit.&rdquo; She sat up.</p></p>

<p><p>Then he sat up. He ripped up the shoulder part of her dress and examined her wound. It was black and burned and looked painful. &ldquo;My gosh! It&rsquo;s some injury.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t hurt that much.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We better get you fixed up.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Now, Margrit, with a cast on her arm, put her head on Terry&rsquo;s shoulder. He put his arm around her as they watched the kids play happily.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Until I met Nebula I never knew what unconditional love was.&rdquo; she said.</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the same for me. My love for you was unconditional as well. I didn&rsquo;t care where you came from or how greedy you were or how many you fought and killed...I loved you for who you are.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Terry...I just hope Nebula is happy with us.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he is.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Is there such a thing as unconditional love? After that event, Nebula truly believed that such a thing does exist. It is rarer than any of the most valuable treasures in the universe...</p></p>





<p> <hr /> <p>The Pride and the Proud</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="pp_a">[ A ] - Part 1</span></p></center> 

<p><p>The Junior Martial Arts Tournament, held every year, are considered the children&rsquo;s dreams, their goals, their desires. The toughest and best-trained juniors come every year to compete, and only one will be champ.</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita was walking down the street with her ten year old son, little Nebula, holding his hand. They were licking their ice creams and walking down the street, looking to have some fun. It was a casual day in the city, and little Neb loved it. There was always something to do here, perhaps watching a movie, playing arcade games, or just going to the park and site and relax.</p></p>

<p><p>She finished her cone and tossed it carelessly onto the street. A nosy passer-by saw this littering and shouted: &ldquo;Hey you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit and her son turned attention to her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just throw your garbage here like that. We have trash cans! Come over here and pick it up!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you make me, snot face? I&rsquo;ll do whatever I want, and you can stay the hell out of it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s right. You can come here and do something about it, or you shove it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, shove it!&rdquo; Nebula said, sticking his tongue out, and pulling his eyelid.</p></p>

<p><p>They continued walking. The passer-by was outraged. She had never seen such rude people before in this city. Even her son has the influence.</p></p>

<p><p>Neb: &ldquo;Wow, that was cool, mom. The way you yelled at her, I bet she&rsquo;d be speechless for hours!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Neb. Some people are just asking for it. There are all kinds of people in this world, and most of them are bad. They&rsquo;re gonna pick on you unless you show &lsquo;em what you&rsquo;re made of.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They went over to the card store and she stopped to look. They had Christmas cards, Thanksgiving cards, and a bunch of other holidays on the display window. Ah, who needs this crap, she thought. Then some thing caught her eye. An announcement, displayed on a sign, read: &ldquo;Sign up here for the Junior Martial Arts Competition entry. Hurry! The deadline is June 6th, 4006! Don&rsquo;t wait another year!&rdquo; A martial arts competition? Sounds very good, she thought. Nebula would win for sure!</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Look at this, son.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a kids&rsquo; tournament.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I heard the prize is huge! You should enter it. I know you can win for sure.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah! This could be fun.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>So they went inside the store and to the sign-up line. Surprisingly, nobody was there. Margrit expected a long line to wait, but she guessed nobody was confident enough in their children for them to enter, unlike her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ah hem.&rdquo; she said.</p></p>

<p><p>Agent: &ldquo;You want to sign up your son for the junior tornament?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Agent: &ldquo;Oh, what a cute little boy. I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll do great.&rdquo; He took out a form. Here, just fill this out.</p></p>

<p><p>Just then, a mother and her son came and asked to sign up. The son gave nasty looks to little Neb.</p></p>

<p><p>Mrs. Jody: &ldquo;Hmmph. I know my little champ can win without a doubt. You might as well quit, because your son doesn&rsquo;t stand a chance.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mrs Jody: &ldquo;Ha ha ha ha! He&rsquo;s so puny and scrawny, he&rsquo;ll get clobbered.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Grrrr...listen lady, my son can beat your son anytime, anywhere.&rdquo; Then, she bragged: &ldquo;In fact, Nebula can beat your son with his arms tied behind his back.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha! What a weird name. Gosh, you sure know how to name your children. I feel sorry for your boy.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ramon: &ldquo;Listen up, squirt, you might as well quit now.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to quit like a coward. You&rsquo;ll be begging for my mercy soon.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ramon: &ldquo;Yeah, soon, in a million years.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The nasty mother took her son out the store, laughing.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit was outraged.: &ldquo;Grrrr. Listen Nebula, you&rsquo;re going to beat him no matter what! Don&rsquo;t let them influence you. He doesn&rsquo;t stand a chance.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Meanwhile, Terry and his son Tyson ran into a similar situation. They were in the theme park enjoying the time of their lives, until Terry bumped into some guy and spilled ice cream on his shirt.</p></p>

<p><p>Mr. Jody: &ldquo;Ahhhhh! My shirt! Why don&rsquo;t you watch where you&rsquo;re going, moron!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I feel really bad. It was an accident.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mr. Jody: &ldquo;Are you blind or something? Lousy low-class punk.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;Hey mister, you don&rsquo;t have get nasty here. It was just an accident!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mr. Jody: &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon son, I can&rsquo;t stand this filthy place anymore.&rdquo; He took his son and walked away.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;Daddy, why was he so mean?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;Some people are just like that. There is no explanation.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>So they continued walking down the paths, trying not to let what just happened ruin their day. Just then, some thing caught Terry Spade&rsquo;s eye.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sign up here for the Junior Martial Arts Competition entry. Hurry! The deadline is June 6th, 4006! Don&rsquo;t wait another year!&rdquo; the sign read.</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;Hey son, are you thinking what I&rsquo;m thinking?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;Uhhhh....?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sign up for the tornament. What do you think?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s cool. I always wanted to be in one.&rdquo; he said, smiling.</p></p>

<p><p>Terry took his son to the sign up booth and requested a form.</p></p>

<p><p>The nasty father and his nasty son had already filled out a form, and they were watching Terry. &ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s that guy who ruined my shirt. He&rsquo;s signing up for the competition too.&rdquo; the father said. &ldquo;That fool has no chance of winning. I know my son can beat his son without a sweat. Right, son?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Damon: &ldquo;Right dad!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry, not turning back, stilling filling out the form, said: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get too overconfident yet. Every child has a fair chance of winning.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mr. Jody: &ldquo;Not your son! Ha ha ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Damon laughed with him.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;Shut up.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;Laugh it all you want. It&rsquo;s guys like you who come out crying in the end.&rdquo; He took his son and left.</p></p>

<p><p>Back home, neither Terry or Margrit knew how similiar their experiences were. Both planned to tell each other that they have signed up for the tornament. The kids were more excited than ever and couldn&rsquo;t wait to tell his brother.</p></p>

<p><p>On the meal table, Margrit and Terry sat across from each other, waiting for the right time to speak. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never guess what happened today.&rdquo; Margrit said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Neither will you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I signed up Nebula for the Junior Martial Arts Tornament.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Really? Me too. Tyson is entering as well.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll both be in it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wow, that&rsquo;s really cool.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;But what would happen if we had to fight each other?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;Good question.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s going to be a match I can&rsquo;t miss.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;If the competition rests on you two, then it doesn&rsquo;t which one of you wins, my little champions. Either way, we still get the prize.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;m sure the prize money has increased.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>What their mother said really got into their heads. This was going to be a great time, they thought. They just assumed nobody would be a match for them and the money is theirs for the taking. Soon enough, they predicted, it will be brother vs. brother in the final round. Oh yes, they could imagine it already.</p></p>

<p><p>But of course, they&rsquo;re gonna have to train real hard for the competition. Yep, Margrit had it planned out already. She was gonna train her little Neb to be the strongest kid alive. So, predictably, Margarita began the training immediately the next day.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Alright, give it all you got! That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s the spirit.&rdquo; Margrit yelled as Nebula punched the punching bag. &ldquo;No no no, harder. Punch harder.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; Pow!</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Harder! This is your most hated enemy. Now what are you going to do?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula gave a hard punch, but she was still not satisfied.</p></p>

<p><p>Then the nasty mother, the nasty father and their nasty children, Ramon and Damon came in to the public training center. Ramon was the older brother and Damon was the younger one. There seemed to be many similiarites between these two familes, the Spades and the Jodys. Margrit now knew the Jodys had two children, both whom were going to enter the tornament. Looks like this was going to be double trouble.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit ignored them as they walked pass, but Mrs. Jody couldn&rsquo;t ignore her. &ldquo;Hey if it isn&rsquo;t the woman I met the other day, and her failure son.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t listen to them Nebula. I know you can win without a doubt.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mrs. Jody: &ldquo;Yeah, in your dreams.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;You just watch. When my son fights your son, it&rsquo;s gonna be over in a second. You won&rsquo;t even know what happened.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mrs. Jody: &ldquo;Hmmmph. We&rsquo;ll see about that.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Damon: &ldquo;See you there, squirt.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;ll be there alright. Just hope you don&rsquo;t quit like a chicken.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The nasty family was gone into the other room, and the mother and son were alone again.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let what they say destroy your spirit. Never let your enemies get the better of you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes mom.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My little Nebula, I know you can win.&rdquo; she said affirmitively. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the strongest kid alive, and you&rsquo;re gonna show them.&rdquo; she said in such a hopeful tone that Neb was full of confidence.</p></p>

<p><p>He continued punching the bag.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now, pretend this is your worse enemy ever.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Pow! He punched harder.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, pretend this is Vegeta, the one who killed Jack and destroyed your home planet!!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Jack?&rdquo; Nebula hit the bag so hard it fell off its hook and got slammed into the wall, and the sand leaked out.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, that is the strength you need. Never forget how angry you were when you lost some one you loved so much! Never!&rdquo;</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="pp_b">[ B ] - Part 2</span></p></center> 


<p><p>As this was happening, Terry was training little Tyson outside of the house, where there was plenty of space. On the fields, Terry set up a scare crow figure for his son to hit.</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;Now, attack your opponent.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson punched the piece of wood. Thud! Thud!</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, very good. You have to give it all you got.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson punched it again. Pow! Then he jumped and kicked the scare crow&rsquo;s head. Thud! &ldquo;Will I ever be as strong as you, dad?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I think you will, someday.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I doubt it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Never have doubts, son. One day, you will be able to do what I can do. If you train hard enough, you can be as strong as me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>As coincidental as things may be, Zelfire also had to train a kid for the upcoming event. No, it wasn&rsquo;t his son.</p></p>

<p><p>There was a knock at the door. Knock knock.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; Zelfire said, opening the door.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ah hem.&rdquo; The stranger cleared his throat. &ldquo;Hello, Mr. Zelfire Lang.&rdquo; He was accompanied by a little kid.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Do I know you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No you don&rsquo;t know me, but I do know you. You&rsquo;re one of the greatest martial artists around. If it would not be too much trouble, sir, I&rsquo;d like you to train my son for the junior tornament.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Train your son?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I will pay you in full. Any reasonable amount you want.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not the money. If you truly want to win...your son must have some kind of experience...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh yes, of course he does. Right, T.J.?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>His son nodded.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I am Mr. Harley.&rdquo; He and Zell shook hands.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Harley, if he has what it takes to win, and has the confidence, then I will do my part to the fullest.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Thank you sir.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Before they knew it, the tornament was already here. It was time for their moment of triumph. The Junior Martial Arts Tornament was taking place in the same place it was last year, the battle stadium in the middle of the city. On that day, tons of people were there, and it was completely crowded. Hundreds of hopeful children awaited this day for a whole year, and it will either make them or break them. Keep in mind, there can be only one winner.</p></p>

<p><p>Half an hour later, after the audience had taken their seats, the competition was about to begin. The contestants and their parents entered through the entrance hallway, into the fields, and in the middle of it was the platform where the fights would be taking place, visible from all the seats.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Look at all those bright kids. Looks like there&rsquo;s more entering this year.&rdquo; Medura said, watching from the small room above the entrance hall. Through the window, he could see the platform clearly, probably the best view in the whole stadium.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. It gets better and better.&rdquo; his assistant said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now...which one is the potential winner?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to tell.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. It&rsquo;s very hard to tell. Some youngsters have much potential in their early years.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Now, the rules for the tornament:</p></p>

<p><p>Each contestant must be under fifteen years of age and passed the qualifying round to participate. There will be hundreds of participants, and each one must defeat an opponent to advance to the next round. There will be a referee to watch the fight on the ring, along with hidden cameras to make sure the kids don&rsquo;t cheat.</p></p>

<p><p>What counts as cheating? Using weapons. Using any kinds of distraction on the battle field or from the audience. Throwing sand or dangerous chemicals into an opponent&rsquo;s eyes. Etc...(use common sense)</p></p>

<p><p>Cheating is absolutely not tolerated. If one is found to be cheating, then he/she will be kicked out of the tornament for a minimum of five years. Also, a participant will be kicked out if he/she leaves the stadium without approval, or violates any of the stadium rules.</p></p>

<p><p>During the actual fighting, a fighter loses if: he/she falls off the ring, is knocked out, or gives up.</p></p>

<p><p>Now that is clear, let the tornament begin. The referee blew the whistle on his neck, and the whole stadium was silenced. &ldquo;Round one will officially begin now.&rdquo; he yelled.</p></p>

<p><p>Everybody knew where they belonged by looking at the signs on the hallway. It showed the tornament layout, on the very bottom was the contestants&rsquo; positions, and which round they will be starting in.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Tyke, it&rsquo;s time to begin.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson gulped and he grew really nervous.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get so nervous. Just do your best. And win!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;Go get &lsquo;em.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson walked up the few steps to the ring as his opponent was. They stood on opposite sides, and they walked to a running distance from each other. The referee was standing between them, giving signals. Tyke saw that his opponent was about his height, and equally nervous. Realizing this, Tyke grew un-nervous and confident.</p></p>

<p><p>Referee: &ldquo;The first round will be The blue square, Ronny versus red square, Tyson! On my signal...begin!&rdquo; The bell rang. DING!</p></p>

<p><p>The two kids bowed and got into fighting position.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;Come on bro! You can do it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ronny jumped at Tyke and kicked, and Tyke blocked his foot. Ronny landed, then sweeped and tripped Tyke.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t lose!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ronny: &ldquo;Take this!&rdquo; He punched.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson blocked, then counter - punched. Pow! Ronny fell back and didn&rsquo;t know what hit him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What the!!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson ran and kicked him, and he landed on the grass.</p></p>

<p><p>The referee blew the whistle: &ldquo;Out of the ring. The red square wins!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;Yay! I won! I won!&rdquo; He jumped off the ring and joined his family.</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;Great job son!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;You were excellent.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud of you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They didn&rsquo;t know they were overly excited. It was only the first round. The true competition hasn&rsquo;t even begun.</p></p>

<p><p>Mrs. Jody: &ldquo;Look at those imbeciles. One win and they&rsquo;re so happy.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>As predicted, Tyson and Nebula, the super duper kids, passed round by round like nothing. They basically breezed through the fights, but the trouble was just starting.</p></p>

<p><p>Mrs. Jody: &ldquo;Well, looks like your son will be fighting my Damon in the next round.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Yes. Have you said your prayers yet?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mrs. Jody: &ldquo;Ha ha! The only person praying will be you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Just wait and see.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mrs. Jody: &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we make things more interesting? I am so confident in my children I am willing to bet money on them.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Very well. I will bet 500 units that Nebula can beat your Ramon.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Deal.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get so cocky. Maybe Tyson can beat both your children. Hey, you never know.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, right.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Uh oh, looks like things just got a little more intense. 500 units was a lot of money, and Margrit was sure she is going to win the bet.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Medura: &ldquo;Ahh...such an exciting tornament we have this year.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Assistant: &ldquo;These kids just get stronger and stronger.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Medura: &ldquo;There are still so many of them left, but I have already set my sights on a certain few who may be potential winners.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes. I can tell. There are six of them which possess abilities beyond what any normal child can do. Damon Jody, Ramond Jody, Nebula Spade, Tyson Spade, Honda Tokugawa, and T.J. Harley&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The only question is, which one will win.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;So, it is going to be half an hour until the next round.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;The kids should rest for the time being.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Just then, Margrit recognized Zelfire from the crowd of parents. &ldquo;Zell?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire: &ldquo;Hey guys. What a coincidence, eh?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;You came to watch?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire: &ldquo;Actually, I was paid to train some body&rsquo;s son for him. Neat, huh?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;Really? Who&rsquo;s the kid?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;His name is T.J. He should be going to the ring anytime now.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The crowd was cheering wildly for the next two competitors to begin. They cheered and screamed and applauded and whistled.</p></p>

<p><p>T.J. went up the flight of steps and awaited his moment of glory. He was a kid about Tyson&rsquo;s height, with a red band on his head, dressed in gym clothes and ninja shoes. His hair was black and messy and he had a bright, confident smile. He waved to the audience and then to Zell, his master.</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire waved back. &ldquo;Good luck, T.J.!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>T.J. grinned and turned attention to his opponent. He was going to be facing a fat sumo wrestler from Japan named Honda.</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire: &ldquo;Be careful!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Referee: &ldquo;And now, this round...it&rsquo;s the blue square, T.J. versus the red square, Honda!&rdquo; The bell rang and the crowd cheered even more.</p></p>

<p><p>T.J. punched Honda&rsquo;s stomach, but it was just a blab of flesh, and it didn&rsquo;t affect him.</p></p>

<p><p>Honda: &ldquo;I will crush you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>T.J.: &ldquo;Yipes!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Honda grabbed him and lifted him up. T.J.&rsquo;s feet kicked helplessly. Honda threw him across the ring, and he almost fell off. He was barely on the edge. T.J. got up and grunted.</p></p>

<p><p>Honda: &ldquo;Muahahahaha. I&rsquo;m coming.&rdquo; He took each step like a giant, with his hands on his lap.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Can T.J. beat this kid?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he can. He has a lot of potential.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>As Honda approached, T.J. jumped up and punched his face. Kapow! Then he slided between the fat boy&rsquo;s legs, going behind him, getting up, and kicked his back. Honda fell off the ring face flat. The bell rang. The battle was over.</p></p>

<p><p>Referee: &ldquo;The red square, T.J., wins!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire: &ldquo;See? I told you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;Well, now I&rsquo;m worried. He may be a challenge to Tyke or Nebula.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire: &ldquo;Really? That was what I was hoping for.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Referee: &ldquo;And now, this round...it&rsquo;s the blue square, Tyson, versus the red square, Damon!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The two kids got ready.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Go get him son!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mrs. Jody: &ldquo;My son will crush your son!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Not likely.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You know it and I know it. Might as well tell him to give him. It&rsquo;s gonna save him a lot of pain.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The two angry women growled at each other as the fighters began.</p></p>

<p><p>Whoosh! Damon charged and punched, and Tyson dodged to the side. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make you cry like a baby.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Come and try.&rdquo; Tyson hollered back.</p></p>

<p><p>Bam! Tyson got hit in the face and landed on his back. Splat!</p></p>

<p><p>Mrs. Jody: &ldquo;Ouch. That has gotta hurt.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Arrrrgh. You just wait and see.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson was ready for more. Damon unleashed a fury of fists at the poor boy, who dodged.</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t just go on defense! Fight back.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson dodged, then punched, then Damon grabbed his fist. &ldquo;He he he he.&rdquo; He aimed his knee at Tyke&rsquo;s stomach, and got blocked by Tyke&rsquo;s palm. Tyke pushed him back, then kicked his stomach. He fell and landed on his butt.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Now, that has to hurt.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mrs. Jody: &ldquo;Get up Damon! Finish him!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Damon charged, then punched, Tyke blocked, then Damon got on the floor and did a sweep, Tyke jumped to a safe place.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What the?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyke: &ldquo;Miss me!&rdquo; He gave Damon a really good punch in the guts and it was all over.</p></p>

<p><p>Damon grabbed his stomach and moaned and groaned painfully on his knees. The referee counted from one to ten but he still didn&rsquo;t get up. &ldquo;The blue square, Tyson, wins!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyke: &ldquo;Yay! I won!&rdquo; He was jumping up and down happily.</p></p>

<p><p>Mr. Jody: &ldquo;Oh brother...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mrs. Jody: &ldquo;Noooooooo...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Ha ha! Who&rsquo;s laughing now. YOU should give up before you embarass yourself.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Referee: &ldquo;And now, this round...the blue square, T.J., versus the red square, Ramon.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Your enemy is about to fight. Remember that is Ramon, your worse enemy.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The next match was T.J. vs. Ramond.</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire: &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon. Win this one for your folks.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>T.J. smiled confidently. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t disappoint you, dad.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ramon: &ldquo;Your finished!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They ran into each other and gave some punches and karate chops. Then, with them on the opposite corners of the ring, they ran forward and jumped up and kicked each other. Whoosh! They landed and T.J. felt a strange pain on his stomach. &ldquo;Uuuuuugh...uuuuuuuuuh...&rdquo; He grabbed his stomach and almost trampled. Ramon, with the oppurtunity, punched him out of the ring. It was over.</p></p>

<p><p>Referee: &ldquo;T.J. has fallen out of the ring, so the red square, Ramon wins!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Oh well, so much for your prodigy kid.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>T.J. got up slowly, humiliated and disgraced at his defeat. With his head down, he walked towards his trainer. &ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zell: &ldquo;Sorry? Are you kidding? You were great out there.&rdquo; He touched the kid&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Absolutely fantastic.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>T.J.: &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Of course. You put out a great performance. You might have lost, but I&rsquo;m sure your father would be proud you even made it this far.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Who are you kidding? I mean, for crying out loud, that is Mrs. Jody&rsquo;s child he lost to...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ah hem.&rdquo; Terry said, and she became silent.</p></p>

<p><p>Zell: &ldquo;Never expect to win on your first try in this tornament. You might win next year.&rdquo;</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="pp_c">[ C ] - Part 3 </span></p></center>

<p><p>After a few more rounds, it was the semi-finals already. Nebula had already finished off his opponent with a simple knock on the face, and now it was Tyson&rsquo;s turn.</p></p>

<p><p>Referee: &ldquo;And now, the second round of the semi-finals, the blue square, Tyson, versus the red square, Ramon.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ramon: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna make you pay for putting my brother outta the ring. You&rsquo;re gonna lose.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyke: &ldquo;Not in your life, big bully.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Bully? I&rsquo;ll show you bully.&rdquo; He pounded his own palm with his fist. Then he tilted his head sideways, making cracking sounds.</p></p>

<p><p>They ran into each other and punched - Pow! Ramon jabbed his chest and Tyke fell backwards. He bounced back up on his feet and kicked. Ramon blocked and punched, Tyke dodged. He ran sideways and Ramon ran after him. Suddenly, Tyke turned around and jumped behind Ramon, then made a flying kick on his back.</p></p>

<p><p>Ramon: &ldquo;Ouch! You&rsquo;ll pay for that.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyke: &ldquo;Make me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I will. He he he he.&rdquo; He grinned as he reached into his pocket and produced a small, white, shiny marble, barely noticable since it was so small.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyke: &ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;m coming!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He charged and Ramon threw the marble at him, and once in contact with his stomach, electric currents shocked Tyke and he felt a strange pain. He fell on his knees and grabbed his stomach. &ldquo;Owww...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;What the heck are you doing...Tyke get up!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s not right.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;Tyke? What&rsquo;s wrong with him?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyke: &ldquo;Owww...what is happening?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ramon: &ldquo;Ha ha ha ha ha! This will be a piece of cake, as they say.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He ran and punched, and Tyke dodged, but his movements were slowler and crappier than usual. Kaput! Tyke got hit in the face and landed on his back.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;This doesn&rsquo;t make any sense! Tyke should be winning.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mrs. Jody was laughing, with one hand covering her mouth. &ldquo;Oh well, you can&rsquo;t win &lsquo;em all. Ohhh, don&rsquo;t feel so sad. You&rsquo;d be happy...if you are cheering for Ramon, that is.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyke and Ramon jumped into the air - Tyke made a fist and Ramon kicked his guts - wham! Tyke fell off the ring! Splat. He crawled up and saw Ramon laughing at him. &ldquo;Darn! I lost.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry walked towards his son and patted him on the shoulder. &ldquo;You did great out there. I&rsquo;m proud of you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Really.&rdquo; Terry said.</p></p>

<p><p>A few minutes later, at last, it was the final round. The audience cheered its fullest as the two competitors entered the ring. Neb waved to his family, as Ramon waved to the audience, smiling evilly.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Tyke is out, so the last hope is Nebula. C&rsquo;mon, I&rsquo;m counting on you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry mother, this will be over faster than you can blink.&rdquo; To a certain extent, he meant that literally. He thought, what could be more embarassing than defeating some one with just one hit at the very beginning? It was gonna be over so fast nobody would know what happened.</p></p>

<p><p>Referee: &ldquo;And now, ladies and gentlemen...the moment you&rsquo;ve been waiting for. The final round of the Junior Martial Arts Championship!&rdquo; Applause and whistling and yelling from the audience. &ldquo;This is it, whoever wins this match goes home the winner!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mrs.Jody: &ldquo;Remember, second place is no different than losing! You gotta win this one! I&rsquo;m not going to raise a failure!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Medura: &ldquo;Hmmm...this should be interesting.&rdquo;<br>  Assistant: &ldquo;Ah, you were right all along. These two were two of the children you said could win.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ramon: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna pulverize ya!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;Big mouth, you&rsquo;re gonna feel it soon enough. And I&rsquo;ll make you pay for my brother.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ramon: &ldquo;Hey, he beat my brother. And I beat him. That makes us even steven.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They ran at each other and punched on the face at the same time. Nebula, with his opponent&rsquo;s fist still in his face, said: &ldquo;Not bad.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They jumped away and got into position. Ramon leaped at him and unleashed a fury of fists, Nebula dodged his head. He was forced back and when he realized he was close to the edge, he blocked. Bam! Ramon&rsquo;s fist hit his elbow. Nebula jabbed him in the guts and he fell backwards. Splat!</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Yeah! Give it to him!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ramon got up and charged, Nebula tripped him. Ramon got up and laughed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so funny?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This championship is mines. He he he he.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What makes you so sure?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ramon charged and made a flying kick, Nebula dodged, then Ramon threw a marble at him. Nebula saw it coming and caught it in his hand. It shocked him painfully and he winced and dropped the marble.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;So this is what you used to cheat. This little handy device sends shockwaves throughout the nerves, stunning the vicitim senseless.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Grrr...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So this was why Tyson lost to you. No wonder it didn&rsquo;t seem right. You&rsquo;re nothing but a cheater!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So what&rsquo;s it to you? As long as I win, nothing matters.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You are a disgrace as a warrior. Very well then. You&rsquo;re going to lose.&rdquo; He disappeared and reappeared in front of Ramon, and he jumped up just as Neb sweeped. As Ramon was still in the air, Neb jumped up and pounded his back. Wham! Now that had to hurt. On their feet again, Ramon punched, Nebula grabbed his fist, not letting it go. The nasty kid was surprised as his strength...his fingers were going to break any second. &ldquo;You lost.&rdquo; Ramon struggled desperately, then Neb let go and jabbed his face. Bam!</p></p>

<p><p>Ramon was really angry now and he ran and punched aimlessly. Nebula dodged swiftly, then kicked him and he fell on the coner of the ring.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Arrrrrgh!&rdquo; the nasty kid growled in anger and fear.</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;Looks like we won.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mrs. Jody: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give up!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit tapped Jody&rsquo;s arm with her elbow. &ldquo;I guess I win the bet. So I hope you got the money ready. Ahhh...what a great day it is, huh? My son wins and becomes the strongest and bestest ever, and I get the prize money and YOUR money as well. This is just my day, eh, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mrs. Jody didn&rsquo;t respond.</p></p>

<p><p>Neb: &ldquo;So, got any last words?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ramon grunted as blood dripped from his mouth.</p></p>

<p><p>Neb: &ldquo;You had it coming all along. You never should have messed with me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The nasty kid just remembered some thing and he secretly grinned. &ldquo;Ah it might seem you&rsquo;re winning. But you see...I haven&rsquo;t used my trump card yet.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Trump card?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You leave me no choice, I must use my secret weapon.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Medura handed the boy a small glass tube, and inside was a blue-ish, thick liquid. &ldquo;Now, kid, remember, if you are losing, then drink this, and victory will be yours for the taking.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo; Ramon replied.</p></p>

<p><p>Ramon: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to use it, but you left me no choice. This was going to be my last resort, and now you&rsquo;ve done it. He he he he.&rdquo; He pulled out the tube from his pocket.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;Not another one...haven&rsquo;t you cheated enough already?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;That heck is going on?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;What are they doing?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The nasty kid drank the blue stuff and Nebula watched in curiosity.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ahhh, delicious.&rdquo; He crushed the glass in his palm. Crack!</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;Ewww...what is that stuff?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That stuff will make me stronger than ever!&rdquo; Suddenly Ramon started to change...physically. Nebula watched in shock and disbelief as he grew taller and bigger right before his eyes. Brown hair sprouted from his hands and his face, and his mouth grew wider and his teeth grew razor sharp. In a matter of minutes, Ramon was no longer Ramon. He was a giant wolf-monster, three times the height of Nebula.</p></p>

<p><p>Mrs. Jody: &ldquo;AAAAAHHHH! My son!&rdquo; She fainted and Mr. Jody caught her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What has he been eating?&rdquo; Mr. Jody asked in horror.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula was trembling all over, whereas, the wolf stood triuphantly.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Ahh! What the hell just happened...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;That kid...just turned into a monster...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;Oh my gosh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;My son is not gonna fight that thing!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;This is crazy!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Wolf: &ldquo;Well, looks like the tides have changed. Now you don&rsquo;t look so tough.&rdquo; He stepped forward, and Nebula could feel the whole ring shaking on each step. Stomp! Stomp! Stomp...Stomp! 4&ldquo;Muahahahaha. Now the glory will be mine.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Gulp...I never expected this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="pp_d">[ D ] - Part 4 </span></p></center>

<p><p>Medura: &ldquo;So, he has decided to use it after all.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The monster approached and dived its claws at him. Nebula jumped away. Then he punched, the monster blocked. &ldquo;I said you never had a chance, and I&rsquo;m right!&rdquo; Wham! He smacked Nebula and fell on the floor. Nebula got up, then got kicked and landed on his back. &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula was still trembling, and then he remembered some thing his mother taught him. A true warrior never shows fear, she once said. And so he swallowed up his fear and turned it into courage. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m impressed. You&rsquo;ve got guts.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The audience and parents were all shocked at the sight. The arena was silent, everybody thought this was some kind of strange dream.</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire ran to the referee, who stood there like a petrified statue, and shook him. &ldquo;Do some thing! That monster is gonna kill the poor kid!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But...there&rsquo;s no rules saying you can&rsquo;t transform in the ring.&rdquo; the referee said, flipping through the pages of a small book.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;Brother!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula, the super kid, leaped and punched the monster&rsquo;s face. It was no use. The monster slashed violently, and Nebula dodged desperately. Despite his size, the monster was pretty fast. He slammed Nebula down hard. &ldquo;Hah hah hah hah hah.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The super kid got up painfully, barely able to maintain his balance.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Nebula! What are you doing? Give up!&rdquo; Margrit yelled.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Give up?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When I&rsquo;m so close to being the winner? No, I&rsquo;ve made it this far. It&rsquo;s too late to give up!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s gonna clobber you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula turned around. His face was full of confidence and courage, and of course, pride. &ldquo;I want to make you proud, mother.&rdquo; he said, smiling.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Nebula, nooooo!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The monster approached, his shadow covering Nebula, blocking out the sun.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I WON&rsquo;T LOSE! Mark my words.&rdquo; Nebula charged forward and dodged the monster&rsquo;s claws. He jumped and punched, the monster blocked, then punched his stomach, and he fell down on his butt. Ramon aimed his foot at him, Nebula avoided it, running to the side.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Nebula...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;This is all your fault.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My fault?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You kept on saying to him how important it is to win, as if winning and glory were more important than life itself. Now it&rsquo;s gotten into his head that he musn&rsquo;t quit like a coward, but fight like a true warrior.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit gasped as she realized her wrongs. Terry was right...she had been too pushy about this from the beginning. From the very moment she saw the sign by the display window, she told him he will win no matter what.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I guess your pride has gotten into him.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;Nebula...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>It was no longer an ordinary match, it was a desperate fight to the death for the super kid. With pride as his main fuel, he ignored his injuries and attacked. Slash! Wham! He got hit really bad and fell. He was at the edge of the ring, the monster advanced. Neb jumped up and charged his finishing move. &ldquo;Nebula Blast!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>But before he fired, Ramon appeared in front of him and whacked him down. The monster fired a hot beam from his mouth and Nebula barely evaded it. Froom! The beam destroyed a piece of the arena. Nebula, while running, fired some energy balls, but they had no effect. The monster ran after him, jumped, then hit Neb&rsquo;s back and whacked him down. He picked up the kid by the head and lifted him. &ldquo;How does it feel?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Neb&rsquo;s eyes were closed, and he was screaming.</p></p>

<p><p>With his other hand, he punched his stomach. Pow! Pow!</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;NEBULA! NOOOOO!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aah! Oof! Ugh!&rdquo; the kid screamed as he was getting pounded.</p></p>

<p><p>Ramon, when done punching, threw Nebula forward and he fell and slided across the ring, almost falling off.</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;Stay down!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hah hah hah hah hah! The winner will be decided now!&rdquo; the monster screamed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Come on then!&rdquo; the super kid yelled bravely.</p></p>

<p><p>Ramon ran and jumped as Nebula charged up energy with his one good arm. The wolf monster jumped and the kid fired the Nebula Blast...every body watched in suspense as the creature opened its mouth wide, ready to sink its claws into him. Margrit was having a heart attack as she watched without blinking, and the same went for Zell, Terry, and Tyson.</p></p>

<p><p>BOOM! It went so fast nobody knew what just happened. The monster&rsquo;s teeth were on Nebula&rsquo;s shoulder and blood splattered on the ring. Neither of the fighters were moving, they just stood there. Seconds later, the monster fell on Neb&rsquo;s side, and the kid didn&rsquo;t even move a muscle.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You lose.&rdquo; the super kid said with much calmness.</p></p>

<p><p>The audience cheered loudly.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;He won! My Nebula won! I knew he could do it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;I had to admit, I didn&rsquo;t think he could do it. But he did.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>With his arm still bleeding, he walked towards the referee. &ldquo;There is no need to count to ten. He will not be getting up.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The referee was speechless and motionless.</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;What an amazing victory.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;But how? I swear Ramon bit Neb&rsquo;s shoulder. How come he&rsquo;s the one who&rsquo;s fallen, and not my brother?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;Yes, he did bite Neb&rsquo;s shoulder, but he was hit before that.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; Tyke asked.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;It was an incredible move. It was so fast the ordinary eye could not have seen it. As you know, Nebula was charging the Nebula Blast as Ramon leaped at him. And the blast hit him in the air.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;So...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;So, taking a direct hit from that attack is very lethal. Ramon grew careless at the end. It hit him and killed him before it even bit Neb.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo; Tyke said in surprise. They were right, he thought, it was a stunning move. The creature was already dead before it bit his shoulder, it happened so fast.</p></p>

<p><p>And so, the new champ went to the middle of the ring with the referee. With a cast on his left arm, he waved his right arm in the air to the cheering audience. The Spade family joined him. Colored papers fell from above and every body was yelling like crazy. It was a proud moment indeed for the family.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I knew you could do it, kid.&rdquo; Margarita said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mother.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Referee: &ldquo;And now, I&rsquo;d like to announce the winner of the Junior Martial Arts Tornament! Nebula Spade!&rdquo; He handed the champ a golden cup, really big golden cup, insribed with his name on it.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ahahahaha!&rdquo; laughed the champ happily as he waved to the crowd.</p></p>

<p><p>As the family enjoyed their fame and victory, the ring was moving. The spot Neb was standing on was moving up and smoking covered the whole ring. They coughed and coughed and couldn&rsquo;t see a damn thing. The spectators ran for their lives, knowing this is a sign of danger. Metal bars surrounded Neb, forming a cage, and it lifted up into the air from a crane attached to the upper tower where Medura&rsquo;s office was. As the smoke cleared away, they stopped coughing.</p></p>

<p><p>Referee: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going?&rdquo; Wham! Medura&rsquo;s assistant knocked him out.</p></p>

<p><p>Magrit: &ldquo;Nebula!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;Heeeeelp!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Medura: &ldquo;Ha ha ha ha ha. The true winner is me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo; Margrit asked.</p></p>

<p><p>Medura: &ldquo;Well, since you asked. I&rsquo;ve been looking for the strongest kid, and I knew this was the perfect place to find it. Now that I have him, I will train him as one of my own and make him a perfect warrior.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;In your dreams, pal.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t taking my son, that&rsquo;s for sure.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Uh uh uh.&rdquo; Medura said, waving his forefinger.</p></p>

<p><p>His assistant ran and attacked, and Terry knocked him away with a chop.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit, with lightning speed, charged at Medura and kicked him out of the ring.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;He had this planned all along? The whole thing was a hoax?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Medura got back on the ring, wiping blood from his mouth. He smiled and took out a tube with a green liquid, the same one Ramon had. The three sayans recognized it immediately.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;No...not another one...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is just great!&rdquo; Tyke said sarcastically.</p></p>

<p><p>Gulp, gulp, gulp. He drank it all down and licked his lips. His stomach bursted out and it was hairy. His arms grew thicker and hairyer...and every thing that happened to Ramon had happened to him. There was now a second wolf monster standing before them, this one even stronger than the last. His clothes shredded apart as his body outgrew them. &ldquo;ROOOOOAR!&rdquo; He pounded his own chest. &ldquo;Ahh, this feels better!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Now, with the spectators gone, silence filled the arena. The true battle was about to begin.</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire: &ldquo;Will this insanity ever end? First that kid, and now this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Medura: &ldquo;Alright, who wants to be my first victim?&rdquo; He took a step forward. Stomp!</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;The only victim here is you. You must have given that kid one of your damned potions so that he can win! And now look at yourself. You would turn yourself into a...monster just to win!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Medura: &ldquo;With victory, comes a price. This is a small price to pay. Winning is the most important thing.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That is where you&rsquo;re wrong.&rdquo; Margrit concluded, and ran and punched. Pow! It hit his chest but didn&rsquo;t hurt.</p></p>

<p><p>Medura: &ldquo;Now I will inflict pain on you.&rdquo; Wham! He slammed her away.</p></p>

<p><p>Terry punched, missed, and got punched in the cheek. Zelfire jumped onto the ring and fired the Energy Blast, and the monster blocked. Little Tyke blasted his back, and the monster turned around and snared. &ldquo;Rrrrrr!&rdquo; He slashed at the kid and Tyke jumped to evade.</p></p>

<p><p>Neb was still in the cage above, watching helplessly. With a broken arm. &ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit and Terry attacked together as Tyke was smart enough to fly up and rescue his bro. But the cage was filled with eletrical wires and Tyke touched the bars and it fried him as he fell.</p></p>

<p><p>Neb: &ldquo;TYSON!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zell caught the falling kid and the monster appeared behind him. Wham. Zell, with Tyke in his arms, fell into the grass.</p></p>

<p><p>Wham! Pow! Whack! The monster fell. Terry and Margrit fired a beam together and he jumped to evade. The beams ended up hitting the spectator seats. Crash!</p></p>

<p><p>Terry jumped up, punched, missed, punched, missed again, and got punched and fell down.</p></p>

<p><p>Medura: &ldquo;Hah hah hah hah!&rdquo; He landed and ran for Margrit.</p></p>

<p><p>She ran and glided on the floor, hoping to give him a good sweep. Thanks to his quick reflexes, he jumped up just in time. Her glide stopped and the monster was above her. He fired hot beams from his mouth and she back flipped to dodged them. Bam! Bam! Bam! Zell was behind him, and he punched. Medura disappeared and appeared above Zell. Wham! Zell was knocked down again.</p></p>

<p><p>Medura: &ldquo;And now, eat my wind gust attack!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He gathered energy and winds from every direction went towards him and formed a mini tornado. But it was big enough to blow the heroes sky high. Whooooosh! He pushed it forward and the tornado hurled towards them. It cracked the floor as it zoomed through. Margrit leaped out of its way, then Terry jumped, then Zell. The tornado hit the spectator area and blew up. Kaboom!</p></p>

<p><p>Neb charged up an energy ball and fired at Medura, hitting his back and making some smoke. &ldquo;ROOOAR!&rdquo; Zell punched him and he fell. Terry got behind him and grabbed him, not letting go.</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;Margarita! Use your most powerful attack now!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;But that&rsquo;ll hurt you too!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;DO IT!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Medura struggled to get free and Terry was losing his grip.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo; he rushed.</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire: &ldquo;Do it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita, with the valuable time she had, gathered energy for the final attack. She extended her arm and opened her palm, facing the monster. &ldquo;Super Energy Bomb!&rdquo; she shouted. Bam! She fired a really big white ball at him.</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;Electro Shield!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He formed a blue shield and it pushed Medura forward. Then Margrit&rsquo;s bomb hit him and he was destroyed. BOOM! Their brilliant teamwork saved them this time.</p></p>

<p><p>The Spade family, including Zell and T.J. were walking together. Neb, the little champ, still had the golden cup.</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;I just wanted you to know son, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you win or lose. I&rsquo;m still gonna be proud of you, kid.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;I earned this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margrit: &ldquo;You certainly did.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;Good job bro! I knew you could do it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terry: &ldquo;Well, I guess we all learned a lesson from this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire: &ldquo;What lesson would that be?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Every body laughed and continued walking.</p></p>

<p><p>No matter what the circumstances are, there is always a price for victory, whether it is a small or big price to pay. A warrior may attain victory if he is willing to pay the price. Sometimes the price is very big. It could mean giving up his own life or something just as important.</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="locket">The Locket of Fate</span></p></center>


<p><p>&ldquo;A long, long time ago there once lived an emperor unlike any others before him. As a boy, he possessed powers beyond belief. When he was ten, he ruled this whole world, and no one dared to go against him, but only the bravest warriors dared to fight the evil tyrant. With his incredible powers, he crushed all opposition to his authority, and those who were smart obeyed him, and didn&rsquo;t even think about opposing him.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The faceless boy, with the crystal ball on his hat, a golden locket that reached his stomach, and the best silk clothes of all the nation, was sitting on the royal chair, looking around the large room, pleased that everyone was afraid of him. The royal guards were standing in two parallel rows facing each other across from the red carpet. Moments passed by, filled with silence, then broken by the noise of doors slamming open. Then a guy dressed in silver armor barged in and runs directly at the emperor. &ldquo;I will destroy you, you devil!&rdquo; he shouted, pointing his index finger at the boy. He drew out a long sword and ran up the steps. SLASH! He intended to slash the boy, but instead hit the chair. The boy was in mid-air, and then landed on the floor smoothly. The guards did nothing but gasped for a moment, and continue to watch. Then the warrior ran at him again, aiming his sword at the boy&rsquo;s face. Just before he hits him, an energy barrier forms around the child, and stopped the warrior&rsquo;s attack. He was surprised that he couldn&rsquo;t touch him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No one could stop him, no one...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, the child raises his hand, and an energy beam shoots from his palm and destroys the warrior&rsquo;s body. He didn&rsquo;t even had a chance to scream. Smoke forms around the body, then is gone a few seconds later. Immediately, the guards bow down on one knee and stare at the floor, afraid the angry emperor would release his power on them. The boy goes up the steps slowly, and sits down on the chair again.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Many have asked how the Sayan Emperor got its power from, but only a few know that the key to all his strength came from the golden locket he wore on his neck. After he died, the locket was passed to his successor, but for so many generations no one could unlock the secrets of the locket, no one knew the secret to using the locket.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wow, this mystery has remained unsolved for hundreds of years.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Thousands. And it&rsquo;s still unsolved today.&rdquo; said the old man.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well, if that boy could do it, then anybody could.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I hope you prove me wrong. I have tried all my life to figure this out, but I had no luck.&rdquo; <strong>Trent</strong> grabbed his son&rsquo;s hand and opened his palm, and put the golden locket in his palm.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You are the last descendent of the <strong>Fei</strong> family, and this locket is your duty. Maybe you can do it, do what all our ancestors could not.&rdquo; Then the old man walked away.</p></p>

<p><p>Later that day, on a rooftop, <strong>Wu Fei</strong> was standing there, looking at the city. (Imagine that, whoever possesses this thing can take over the world, but there&rsquo;s one cache, how do you use it? I wonder how that boy did it.) &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, father. I&rsquo;ll find out the secret to this locket. Ya hear me?!&rdquo; he shouted while looking at the sky.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How dare you come in here and threaten me!&rdquo; shouted emperor <strong>Galaxia</strong>.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You tyrant! I won&rsquo;t let you do any more harm to the people!!&rdquo; the rebel screamed with extreme anger.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well, you came all the way here to fight me, right? So fight me!&rdquo; he challenged.</p></p>

<p><p>The rebel attacked him, and the emperor fought back, laughing through the whole time. Finally, he decided he has enough fun for today. He fired an energy beam from his palms and hit the rebel. ZAP! In an instant his body was turned to ash. The body was burned really bad, and no one could recognize him any more, probably not even himself if he looked at a mirror. Galaxia stared at the corpse for a moment, then turned around.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What are you waiting for? Get this dirty filth off my palace floor!&rdquo; The royal guards immediately dragged the body out of the grand room.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So, that&rsquo;s one more life you&rsquo;ve taken away this week. That makes a total of five.&rdquo; said crudely a voice from behind the columns. Then she walked out of the darkness, revealing herself.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;<strong>General Margarita</strong>.&rdquo; he said.</p></p>

<p><p>Out came a woman with black clothes and a red cape that reached her knees. Some badges shined on her chest, armed with lethal skills, she was a general no one dared to mess with, well, except for Galaxia. She crossed her arms, and looked at him accusingly. &ldquo;Yeah, how many years did it take you to figure out my name?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He laughed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re always full of humor.&rdquo; he said nicely.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Do I look amused? You just killed a man.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;A <strong>dangerous </strong>man who tried to kill me!&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;You saw it, didn&rsquo;t you? I was defending myself. I simply had no choice but to kill him. I have to do this to teach a lesson to others not to mess with the emperor.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeh, of course. You always have an excuse to kill someone, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re always on my case-&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just tired of this, really tired...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Wu Fei&rsquo;s mother, <strong>Sally</strong>, was walking with him and Trent, a casual walk to the market place like every other day. But today was different, and one event will change their lives forever...</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Help!&rdquo; screamed a woman&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Somebody help me! Please!&rdquo; The beggar was cornered against the wall by two royal guards in uniform. The family stopped what they&rsquo;re doing and watched them. &ldquo;What do you want from me?!&rdquo; she screamed helplessly.</p></p>

<p><p>Then the first soldier said: &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t paid your rent in months, lady. Now, we want our money. Just pay us and we&rsquo;ll go away and leave you alone.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I told you, I don&rsquo;t have any! Look at me. Do I look like I have any money on me? I&rsquo;m broke, for God&rsquo;s sake, and I have three children to take care of.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Then the other guy with the gun said: &ldquo;Look lady, that&rsquo;s not our problem. Our job here is to collect our fees. So pay up.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t-&rdquo; she yelled.</p></p>

<p><p>Wu Fei couldn&rsquo;t take it any more. He took a step forward and prepared himself for the worst when his father stopped him. With his hand holding Wu Fei&rsquo;s shoulder tightly, he said: &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t do it. It&rsquo;s not our business. You will bring us in danger if you-&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t just stand here and watch them-&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Listen! It&rsquo;s too risky. Do you know who those men are?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The soldiers continued harassing the helpless woman.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;They are royal guards.&rdquo; Trent said before Wu Fei could answer. &ldquo;They work for the emperor. If you touch them, the emperor will have your head cut off! These people are corrupt and have no respect for us people. They can just go down the street and beat some guy up and they can&rsquo;t be touched. Ever since Lord Galaxia has conquered this nation, our people have been suffering ever since. I know it&rsquo;s cruel, but we can&rsquo;t do anything about it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re wrong, father. We can do something about. But you <strong>won&rsquo;t</strong>.&rdquo; He ran at the guards, and his father&rsquo;s grip couldn&rsquo;t hold his fury.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, Wu Fei!&rdquo; his mother screamed. But it was no use.</p></p>

<p><p>The guy was just about to put his knife into her chest when Wu Fei grabbed his arm. Pained and surprised, the soldier let go of his fingers on the weapon and it dropped on the ground, making a loud cling against the quiet street.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hey, what did she ever do to you? Why don&rsquo;t you give her a break?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The angry guard got free from Wu Fei&rsquo;s grip. &ldquo;How dare you, you peasant! I will have you arrested in a second. No one interferes in our business, understand, boy?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re the royal soldiers of the great Galaxia. If you&rsquo;re smart, you would leave right now.&rdquo; the other said. The woman felt relieved that someone was willing to help her, but also worried of what will happen to him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care who you serve,&rdquo; Wu Fei said. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let you hurt innocent people, no, not when I&rsquo;m around.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t your parents teach you to control your mouth when you&rsquo;re under officials?! Well, let me teach you a lesson, boy-&rdquo; He made a hard fist and aimed it at Wu Fei, but missed. With great quickness, he was able to dodge it and hit the guard&rsquo;s face, sending him falling into the other guy.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Quick, get out of here now!&rdquo; he shouted at the frightened woman. Without thinking, she ran as fast as she could. The guards get back on their feet, not happy at all. The one with the bruised face attacked Wu Fei, while the other loaded his gun. WHOOSH! WHISH! The soldier missed twice and POW! This time got punched in the stomach real bad. He couldn&rsquo;t get up after he fell.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Watch out Wu Fei!&rdquo; he heard his mother shout from behind. His gun was ready to kill. He turned around and saw the soldier pointing the gun at him. There was no way he could escape, he thought, and awaited his doom. In flash, Trent picked up a small piece of rock from the ground, raised his arm back, and threw it at the gun. The rock went right into the hole, then the gun man pulled the trigger. BANG! To his surprise, it was the gun man who exploded, not him. Smoke formed all around the body, when it blew away the corpse&rsquo;s skin was black.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Father......thank you.&rdquo; Wu Fei said, looking at the dead body. Then his father grabbed his hand, &ldquo;Hurry, before some one sees us!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Later that day, inside the royal palace....&ldquo;Hmmm, so someone really dared to attack my royal guards.&rdquo; the emperor said curiously as he scanned the report. The guard with the bruised face was kneeling on 1 knee, as all people do under the presence of a higher authority.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, he was really fast, and strong. We were no match for him.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Describe this <strong>rebel</strong>, sergeant.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well, uhhh, he...looked...he dressed like a peasant, and...ohhh, he was wearing a golden locket on his chest.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Locket? Hmmm...Thank you, you may go.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, your majesty.&rdquo; Then he left.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmmmm, could this be the locket I&rsquo;ve been searching for?&rdquo; Galaxia asked himself, rubbing his chin.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s not.&rdquo; Margarita said ungratefully.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How do you know that it isn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;How many lockets of gold are there in this world? Thousands? Millions? The chances are this is not the one. The legendary treasure is probably lost forever.&rdquo; she said in a tone like there&rsquo;s no hope.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No. I can&rsquo;t let any possibility pass by. I&rsquo;m going to arrest this person, named Wu Fei, and take his locket.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Arrest him? For what? You can&rsquo;t just arrest some body if you feel like it-&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;For assaulting an officer on duty, and better yet, murder.&rdquo; he answered.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Murder?&rdquo; she asked curiously, purposely looking for a way to argue with him. &ldquo;According to the report, the gun exploded when the guard &lsquo;on duty&rsquo; pulled the trigger. It had nothing to do with, what&rsquo;s his name, Wu Fei. To me, that is definitely <strong>not</strong> murder.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Are you saying that he committed suicide?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that-&rdquo;<br>  &ldquo;His gun had been clogged by a foreign object, a rock. Some how he managed to get the object into the gun.&rdquo; Then a pause. &ldquo;And the soldier died because of that.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah, how do you know Wu Fei put the rock in the gun? Did he snatch it from him, put a rock in it and put it back into his pocket? Would the soldier be so careless? Or maybe the soldier thought the gun was too dangerous so he put a rock in it and would take it out only if he needs the gun, but on duty he sorta forget about the rock.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter what crime he committed. What matters is his locket! Look...&rdquo; He pressed a few buttons on the keyboard and the screen filled up with crap. It showed Wu Fei&rsquo;s file picture, and his personal data. The general stared at the flashy screen. &ldquo;According to this, Wu Fei&rsquo;s father is Trent Fei, a direct descendent of the emperor Yosho. It&rsquo;s no coincidence, Margarita, he has <strong>my</strong>locket, and I will do anything to get back what&rsquo;s rightfully mine.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;<strong>Yours?</strong>&rdquo; she said shockingly. &ldquo;That thing belongs to him, and you&rsquo;re just gonna take it away from him just like that. Sometimes you just amaze me....&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Things will change pretty soon. Once I get my hands on that locket I will control this whole planet, and no one can stop me! And then you will be my bride-&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Uuuuuuuk!&rdquo; she said in a disgusted voice, and stuck her tongue out, then turned away from him. &ldquo;Me---marry a guy like you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the emperor, and soon you&rsquo;ll realize how lucky you are.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, right.&rdquo; she said sarcastically, then began to walk away.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wait, where are you going?&rdquo; he shouted, and started to go after her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting out of this dump. This place is boring as hell, how can anyone possibly stand being here every single day?&rdquo; she said, looking around the room she&rsquo;s seen since the day she became a general.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What are you sayin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I want to spend a day outside - with normal civilians, so I can learn more about our people, and have some fun. Have you ever been there, have you? Did you know that things actually happen in the outside world? Look, I&rsquo;m really tired of being cooped up in here, facing the same people every day. I want some excitement, some action! Is that too much to ask? Is it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Are you serious? It&rsquo;s dangerous out there, who knows what you&rsquo;ll face? Without protection...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hey, I can defend myself just fine. I <strong>am</strong> the general, remember?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; So he let her go, feeling that it&rsquo;s better than arguing with her all day.</p></p>

<p><p>The next day, inside the multi-level international Meridian Ocean restaurant....<strong>Terrence</strong> slurped his drink loudly and Wu Fei was afraid someone will look at them and they&rsquo;ll be embarrassed. &ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t you have any manners?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>His friend, wearing a cap backwards, with worn out gloves that showed his fingers, and pants with holes on the knees, replied, &ldquo;Well, old buddy, congrats. I heard from a very reliable source that yesterday you beat the crap out of some guys who were picking on some lady.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t just hurt them, I killed one of them. Well, technically, he killed himself. And...they weren&rsquo;t just <strong>some guys</strong>, they were royal guards.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ohh. That&rsquo;s bad. Very very bad.&rdquo; Then a pause. &ldquo;ARE YOU crazy?!&rdquo; People from all directions stopped eating and stared at their booth. Then Terrence lowered his voice a little. &ldquo;Are you serious? Do you know what they can do to you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I know the consequences.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You can get yourself and your family killed for that. You&rsquo;ll be convicted of treason, and will be executed.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s if they catch me.&rdquo; Wu Fei said confidently. &ldquo;They might know what I look like, but they&rsquo;re never gonna find me.&rdquo; Another pause, this time longer than the last one. Much longer. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s best if I hide away for a while, and not come in contact with anybody.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I see what you mean. By the way, I just have to ask, Wu Fei. Why did you do it?&rdquo; his friend asked plainly.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Why did you throw your life away? I mean, what made you do what you did that day? What made you throw your life away, the life that you&rsquo;ve worked so hard for?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Simple. They were picking on that beggar. They just kept harassing her, just because she couldn&rsquo;t pay them.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Meanwhile, in another booth not so far away from them, was Margarita drinking her juice. It tasted delicious, she thought. (I haven&rsquo;t tasted anything as good as these in years!) She sipped her drink and savored every drop of it. She looked around the level, scanning every thing that&rsquo;s going on. She saw a group of people sitting by the counter laughing, from a joke perhaps. Kids playing with a balloon, with their angry parents yelling at them. Normal people doing normal things. She hasn&rsquo;t been out here in years. Ever since she became a general. The world seemed so much different to her from this point of view. Life is really not that boring. People actually have a life out here. Not so exciting, but at least more exciting than hers. That&rsquo;s it, she thought, I should come out here more often. She thought being a general would make her life better, but to her, that position took her life away.</p></p>

<p><p>At the counter a bunch of royal guards in uniform are making jokes to each other, then one of them notices Margarita. The other guards caught him looking at her, and said: &ldquo;Wow, she&rsquo;s a pretty one. How&rsquo;s about we split her?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>So three of them walked toward her counter and one of them sat across her. She ignored him. He leaned closer to her. &ldquo;Hey there. What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; he asked, smiling.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;None your business.&rdquo; she said, then drank the rest of the juice.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hey, now, that&rsquo;s not very nice. Didn&rsquo;t your parents teach you any respect, girl?&rdquo; The guards standing beside them laughed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a girl. And don&rsquo;t you talk to me about respect! What kind of respect is when I&rsquo;m minding my own business and you just decide to come over here and bother me?&rdquo; she scolded grimly.</p></p>

<p><p>Then the standing guard got offended. &ldquo;Watch your mouth woman! Do you know who we are? How dare you talk to us this way!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She could have said she was the general and the troops would be red-faced and probably never dare to do any stupid-ass thing like this again. But she decided not to reveal her identity to anyone, especially these punks. &ldquo;I perfectly know who you are. A bunch of pathetic off-duty soldiers whose got nothing to do and looking for trouble. I can&rsquo;t believe you actually work for emperor Galaxia. Since when did his soldiers become so corrupted, and annoying? I just want to enjoy my day off drinking but I can&rsquo;t. Soldiers are supposed to protect the citizens, not harm them! People like yourselves have brought shame to the name royal guards.&rdquo; People started looking in their direction.</p></p>

<p><p>Then troop A, who is sitting across from her, grabbed her hand and squeezed it tightly. &ldquo;No one talks about us like that. You have a lot of guts, babe, but it&rsquo;ll cost you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let me go.&rdquo; she said in a threatening voice. Then his grip on her wrist got tighter.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let me tell you something, babe. In all my years I&rsquo;ve never met some one as stubborn as you. You have absolutely no respect for authority, and rebellious people like you are a danger to society.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let me go.&rdquo; she warned again.</p></p>

<p><p>But he didn&rsquo;t listen. Then he moaned painfully, realizing that she stepped on his foot and kicked his knee really hard. Then she got free of his hand and punched him with the other. His back hit against the seats and his eye was instantly black. She lifted her tray of lunch and all the stuff fell on him. She got her drink and poured it on his face. The other soldiers reacted with alert.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I told you. You asked for it.&rdquo; she said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How-how dare you bitch!!!&rdquo; he yelled. People from all directions looked at them. Even Terrance and Wu Fei.</p></p>

<p><p>The other two troops were totally shocked to see this kind of behavior. B grabbed her by the shirt, lifting her off her seat. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have any manners girl? This is treason!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Against trash like you? Trash get what they deserve.&rdquo; she said. She pulled his hand away and jabbed his stomach. Ouch. She elbowed his back, causing him to fall on the table.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What the heck is going on?&rdquo; Terrence asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same thing that has happened to the old lady.&rdquo; Wu Fei got up, started walking.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What I should be doing.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you in enough trouble already?&rdquo; Terrence said, trying to convince his friend to stay outta trouble.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m already a criminal. Heck, I have a death sentence. I might as well do what I have to do.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>C made a fist, launched it at Margarita&rsquo;s face, and luckily she ducked in time. She punched his stomach, then with her other hand hit his cheek, where blood came out all over his face. She kneed him, in which he reacted by covering his hands on his stomach. He screamed out loud in pain. She gave him one more punch, this one with more energy than he could handle. She drew her fist back, launched and hit. POW! His face turned sideways as he fell splat.</p></p>

<p><p>A drew to his feet angrily. He threw the tray from his face and grabbed the knife that was part of the lunch. With her back facing him, he had a valuable one or two seconds to attack. He held the silver weapon firmly and dived at her. She turned around instinctively, grabbed his hand, and the knife fell. Cling. She punched his face once more, then kicked him away.</p></p>

<p><p>Before she knew it, troops throughout the restaurant came at her. There wasn&rsquo;t three anymore, but ten or fifteen. Luckily they came one at a time, which gave her an edge. BOOM! POW! WHAM! One was down. WHACK! POW! Another was down. Then they started coming in twos. No problem for her. While she was fighting, one of the others loaded his gun. Click. He aimed it at the rebel. Just before he fired, Wu Fei threw a lunch tray in his direction.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Duck!&rdquo; he yelled.</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita lowered her head without even thinking. The tray hit the gun man&rsquo;s face and he fell. &ldquo;Nice move.&rdquo; she said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not so bad either.&rdquo; he answered.</p></p>

<p><p>They continued fighting the troops, and with the help of each other, made short work of them. The people ran away in flocks, not wanting to get involved in whatever&rsquo;s going on or not wanting to become part of the fight and getting hurt.</p></p>

<p><p>A was still on the floor, not able to get up. He drew the walkie-talkie thingy from his pocket and turned it on. &ldquo;This is agent 0965, requesting backup. This is a code blue! Repeat code blue! Someone is attacking our troops! Send help!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ahh shut up.&rdquo; she said, and kicked the device away, and stepped on his face. He moaned briefly before he fainted.</p></p>

<p><p>Terrance watched in disbelief of what his friend was doing. He was hiding behind his seat, sticking his head up enough so he can see what's happening. In the corner of his eye he saw Margarita fighting along side Wu Fei. (Hey she looks familiar!) Who could she be? (She&rsquo;s... she&rsquo;s...no way...could she be the general? But why is she attacking her own forces?) This doesn&rsquo;t make sense to him. A lot of things don&rsquo;t make sense.</p></p>

<p><p>When finished disposing of their last two foes, Wu Fei and Margarita have finally met. &ldquo;Thanks for the help, but I could&rsquo;ve beaten them up on my own.&rdquo; she said with gratitude, yet in a I-didn&rsquo;t-need-your-help attitude.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome.&rdquo; he answered gratefully, yet with a this-is-the-thanks-I-get? tone of voice.</p></p>

<p><p>Two of the troops popped out from the bar counter and started shooting like crazy. The one on the left jumped out and ran forward, sweeping side to side. Wu Fei took her hand and ran in the other direction, and she ran with him. They stopped when they reached the end of the level. Only a glass fence stood in between them and falling off into the Meridian sea.</p></p>

<p><p>The troops advanced. They better think fast. It was either jump or get shot. They might have a chance to survive underwater. If they jump, the troops will never catch up. What the heck, Wu Fei thought, it's worth a try. &ldquo;Jump!&rdquo; he yelled.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Down there? Are you nuts?&rdquo; Margarita exclaimed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re ten stories high! We&rsquo;ll never survive.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Can you swim?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ahhh yes...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The troops fired again. With one hand holding Margarita&rsquo;s hand, and the other lifting himself onto the fence, he got ready to jump. Margarita, however was not ready at all, but it&rsquo;s too late for that. Before they knew it, they were in mid-air falling head-first into the water. The troops quickly ran towards the fence, and looked down. They fired at the falling dots, but missed. SPLASH!</p></p>

<p><p>It was dark everywhere. Margarita was still next to him, holding his hand. The rest was unclear to him, but somehow they made it back to the surface, and back to sweet old dry land. They were wet and tired and exhausted. Wu Fei was half on land and half underwater as he pulled himself onto the road. Once his feet were on land, he helped his partner up.</p></p>

<p><p>They stood there on the open road silently as the water dripped from their hair and clothes. A few minutes passed by. &ldquo;Well, that was fun.&rdquo; he said, breaking the silence. &ldquo;We should do it again sometime.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well, I must say, we could have died, but we escaped from those troops.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ahh-hem...my name is Wu Fei.&rdquo; He stuck out his hand, offering a friendly shake.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My name Margarita.&rdquo; They shook hands. &ldquo;Pleased to meet you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Me too.&rdquo; he said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That was really brave of you. Thank you for saving my life.&rdquo; This time, she didn&rsquo;t say it in the tone she said in the restaurant. This time, she actually sounded grateful for what he has done. Even she was a bit surprised herself.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No problem.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well, I gotta go. See you sometime.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; he said as she was leaving. &ldquo;Oh, and by the way...&rdquo;<br>  &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Be careful. These imperial troops are corrupt. Its best if you stay away from them.&rdquo; She disappeared out of sight.</p></p>

<p><p>Galaxia walked down the dark hallway, his gown touching the floor as he advanced. He stopped at close distance to the wizard, who was sitting on nothing, that is, floating in the air.</p></p>

<p><p>In the darkness, Galaxia could not see his face. Actually, he had never seen the wizard&rsquo;s face before, in face, he never saw any features of his body except for his bony hands. He just could not picture what he looked like behind that Grim Reaper gown that concealed his body. The crystal ball floated steadily between the wizard&rsquo;s hands.</p></p>

<p><p>He knew nothing about the wizard, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to bother him that much. Galaxia couldn&rsquo;t stand not knowing anything about any one who works or lives in his palace, or anyone who lives in his country. But it seemed okay for him to know nothing about his advisor. The wizard was always right, in fact, he believed he had psychic abilities.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Do you want something, Emperor?&rdquo; the faceless wizard asked in his mysterious voice.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tell me, who is the most powerful Sayan on Arlia?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It is you, of course.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I want to ask so something...how come it is that Sayans lust for power so much? To the degree that they&rsquo;ll do anything to gain it. Anything at all.&rdquo; he asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The answer is simple.&rdquo; the wizard answered. &ldquo;It is simply the nature of Sayans to have such a desire. It was embedded with them the day they are born. It is what makes your race what it is. Strong and ruthless.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I tell only the truth, Emperor.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you do it, but you are right every time.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I live only to serve you.&rdquo; he said in a creepy voice.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Do you know the whereabouts of the locket?&rdquo; the Emperor asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Emperor Quon Fei&rsquo;s locket? Of course I know about it! It is the first emperor's locket. His most prized possession. And the source of his power.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tell me, is there anything that you don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; Galaxia asked with humor.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I know what you want me to know.&rdquo; he answered seriously.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Is it true that the locket is in Wu Fei&rsquo;s hands?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wu Fei? The descendent of the first emperor. Yes, he has it. It must have been passed down from generation to generation.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Does he know its secret?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Of course he does not. If he did, he would not hesitate to take over your entire empire.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, that makes sense. All I have to do is retrieve my locket.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I must advise you however, that Wu Fei is also an elite warrior.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Him? A peasant? An elite Sayan? Why should I fear him? I am the emperor! I am the best of the elite!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The mystery has been unsolved for centuries, but I know of its secrets...all you have to do is possess the locket. Once you do, the influence of Ethiopia will spread throughout Arlia. And not only the planet, but the galaxy will belong to you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it...I must have Wu Fei&rsquo;s locket...it is what I have been searching for all these years!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>That evening, Wu Fei returned home only to find his parents were missing. As if he didn&rsquo;t feel bad enough already being labeled rebel and now his parents have been kidnapped. When he discovered the door was not locked, he knew something was up.</p></p>

<p><p>He turned the knob, pushing the door slowly, making creaking sounds. The place was fine, that is, until he stepped into the living room. Everything was messed up. The furniture tossed over, jars broken on the floor, carpets ripped up, etc. These are the signs of a struggle. Maybe they took my parents because they want me, he thought. Well, actually, they want his locket. That was what he didn&rsquo;t know. One of the tables wasn&rsquo;t overturned. A piece of paper was placed in the center of its surface. Wu Fei walked over and picked it up.</p></p>

<p><p>He had expected the worse, but he expected wrong. The note said something like:</p></p>

<p><p>From the Royal Desk of Emperor Galaxia:</p></p>

<p><p>Fellow peasant, by now you must have realized that your guardians are being held captive by me.</p></p>

<p><p>I know what you have done two days ago. Offensive assault on an imperial troop is a crime of treason. However, it is not the important issue here. You have something I want. Bring me the locket and you have my word I will set free your guardians. Come in person to the Center District by tomorrow at 1700 hours.</p></p>

<p><p>Failure to show up or showing up without the locket will result in the immediate execution of your loved ones. So you better give me what I want, peasant.</p></p>

<p><p>Wu Fei crumbled the note and his fist. They kidnapped my parents for a stupid locket? Well they can have it! He put his hand on his chest and a sudden gust of fear struck him. Oh no! It&rsquo;s not there! My locket!</p></p>

<p><p>This is really really bad. If I don&rsquo;t bring it, mother and father will be killed! How could I have lost it? I never took it off today! Heck, I haven&rsquo;t taken it off since I&rsquo;ve worn it. Could it have fallen out? No, he logically explained to himself. It was inside his shirt all along. How could it have fallen out so easily? Maybe somebody stole it. I did not get near anyone today-</p></p>

<p><p>Terrance? Could he have...No, he wouldn&rsquo;t do such a thing. He&rsquo;s my loyal friend. Then something struck him -</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita! Yes! They were underwater for a few minutes. He remembered vaguely about what happened down there. She must have taken when he was unaware of it! It has to be it! Since he got out of the water his chest felt back to normal! Yes! How could she!!! How dare she stole my locket!</p></p>

<p><p>What now, what now? He asked himself, walking back and forth. Then another thought struck him hard. Margarita...that name sounds familiar. She even looked familiar. She&rsquo;s the general? The general of Sayans? &ldquo;No way.&rdquo; he said out loud. Maybe she is. That would explain her fighting skills. And if he knew laws, he knew where the general lives...</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What do you want from us?&rdquo; Trent asked bravely.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ohh, nothing. Just your locket.&rdquo; the emperor answered.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Quon Fei&rsquo;s locket?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, exactly.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That locket is too dangerous to fall into your hands!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Shut up old man. You had that locket all this time and you never knew how to unleash its power. It&rsquo;s a waste for you to have it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, you must not have the locket! It is too dangerous!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>It was night time. Margarita was sitting in her room, which was located in the corner section of the Imperial Palace. The palace was where all officials lived and troops reported to work. Living in this luxurious place is every Sayan&rsquo;s dream, but for a certain general this place is a nightmarish hell hole.</p></p>

<p><p>Who could stand this place? Who could be patient enough to stay in this rotten place? Well, I certainly can&rsquo;t. Being a general isn&rsquo;t so great after all. An idea just popped up in her mind. It seemed absurd at first, but it made more and more sense as she thought about it. She was no different from the prisoners in the dungeon. They were trapped in cells. She was a prisoner disguised by her uniform. Rules and rules...she had to follow rules...unlike the other people who live freely.</p></p>

<p><p>Oh how she wanted to be free. That day was supposed to be her day off, a day in the normal world. But it was ruined by some troops. Her troops, actually. They didn&rsquo;t know who she was. Wu Fei was right...troops are corrupt...they would even dare to harass the general...only because they thought she was just a peasant. Those idiots. I&rsquo;ll get them later, she thought.</p></p>

<p><p>She held the locket in her hand, dangling it at eye level. She examined it curiously and with great interest. The golden, locket was in the shape of a heart, with pearls making up the chain. It looked really shiny and stood against all the other crappy jewelry she had. (So this is the locket Galaxia wants so badly. What&rsquo;s so special about it?) She like mysteries. And figuring out the importance of this locket would be an interesting one for her. She put it around her neck, and looked at the mirror. It looks great on me, she thought. It perfectly matched her pink night dress. She kept staring at the mirror for a few minutes. Then went to sleep.</p></p>

<p><p>When she sat on the bed, she heard a noise from outside the window. Wu Fei showed up. He climbed up from the bricks on the wall and was now entering her window. In a state of shock she let out a brief scream. &ldquo;What are you doing here?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What am I doing here? Take a guess!&rdquo; he said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re intruding into my room peasant!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;And you stole my necklace!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ohhh, you mean this locket?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Give it back to me!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You want it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Too bad! Finders keepers!&rdquo; she said childishly.</p></p>

<p><p>Wu Fei was really pissed off. He advanced threateningly. &ldquo;This is no joke! I need it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mine!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;So back off!&rdquo; She stepped back. Her legs bumped against the desk that had the mirror. Her right hand quickly scrambled behind her, looking for a weapon. Out came a knife. She held it firmly and slashed at him, and he dodged it. She sliced again and again, only to miss. She sliced again, he ducked it, and moved to the other end of the room. Now he was trapped. She slashed the knife at him. He grabbed her armed hand, stopping the sharp thing from cutting his head.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I just want my necklace lady!&rdquo; Her fingers opened, dropping the weapon. With her other hand she made a fist and punched. He blocked it with his other hand. They struggled for a few seconds. Margarita was over powered, being pushed back a few steps. Suddenly their hands got free and the fists were flying. She made a karate chop, which he blocked with his elbow, and ouch did that hurt. He made a punch and she dodged. She kneed his stomach and he moaned. With the chance she had, she picked up the dropped knife and charged into him. They both fell on the carpet, and rolled a couple of times before she got on top. Her knife was pointing at his neck, ready to kill.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; she said. His hands were too far away to push her, and too risky. One wrong move and bye bye neck. &ldquo;I got you now!&rdquo; She lowered her head and her face met his. &ldquo;Intruding into my home is a crime of treason!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Stealing is also a crime.&rdquo; he blurred out. How true. With great agility, he grabbed her armed hand and once again the knife dropped. His other hand captured her other hand and they rolled over. Now Wu Fei was on top of her. She struggled to get free but her hands were trapped. He lowered his face close to hers.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now, I got you!&rdquo; Before he knew it, he was kissing her lips. He didn&rsquo;t know what came over him, but it just happened. She was not trying to resist, but just let him kiss her.</p></p>

<p><p>When it was over he got off her and she got up. They breathed hard, replenishing their strength from the fight, and the kiss. Standing across each other, and looked at each other. No words came out.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m...I&rsquo;m sorry. I didn&rsquo;t know what came over me.&rdquo; he said.</p></p>

<p><p>She walked towards him and looked at him strangely. They kissed again. This time it was even better.</p></p>

<p><p>Before they knew it, it was morning already. Wu Fei woke up and discovered he wasn&rsquo;t on his own bed. UH OH...</p></p>

<p><p>He was in a girl&rsquo;s bed. It was really comfy. He was even more shocked to find out he wasn&rsquo;t wearing any clothes. They were discarded on the carpet floor. Margarita was naked, sleeping pleasantly next to him. Now it was all coming back...he remembered everything about last night.</p></p>

<p><p>He put his hand on her cheek. He brushed her hair lightly. She woke up and he was surprised. &ldquo;Did I wake you?&rdquo; he asked guiltily.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wu Fei...&rdquo; she said, and could not finish.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Last night was wonderful.&rdquo; she said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It was for me too.&rdquo; Then suddenly he remembered he had to save his father, who was held for ransom. &ldquo;I have to go.&rdquo; he said in a hurry.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Right now?&rdquo; she asked in surprise.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My parents are being held captive! I need that necklace.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I understand.&rdquo; She turned aside, grabbed the locket. Then turned back, and put it in Wu Fei&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;Take it. It belongs to you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He took it and put it around his neck. He got off the bed and put on his clothes. &ldquo;Good luck, Wu Fei.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; He went over to the window.</p></p>

<p><p>When he stuck one leg out, she blurted out &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She sat up, pulling the blanket up. &ldquo;Will we ever see each other again?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well...&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That depends on destiny. If we were meant for each other, then we might meet again.&rdquo; Then jumped out the window, landed on the grass in a crouch. Time to go.</p></p>

<p><p>She was quite sad when he left. She wished he could stay only a while longer, only a little while. But what could she expect?? He had to save his parents. What she didn&rsquo;t know was that the kidnapper was Galaxia.</p></p>

<p><p>Wu Fei arrived at the Center District just on time. His parents were inside one of the crappy wooden buildings. He went inside. Mom and dad were tied up against the chairs, guarded by some troops. A typical kidnapping scene. Galaxia was in front of them, smiling.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So you finally came. I knew you wouldn&rsquo;t let your guardians die. They mean too much to you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sally was overjoyed to see her son.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wu Fei! Don&rsquo;t give him the locket!&rdquo; Trent screamed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad they&rsquo;re fine.&rdquo; Wu Fei said, ignoring his father.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Of course they are. They have been under my special care for the past twenty hundred hours. Do you have what I want?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, right here.&rdquo; He pulled the locket out of his shirt just enough so Galaxia can see it. &ldquo;Release my parents first.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Give me my locket first.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No way, you do it first.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wu Fei,&rdquo; Galaxia said calmly. &ldquo;We cannot negotiate if we cannot trust each other.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Just hand over the necklace and I promise to release them.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Wu Fei sighed. He took it off and advanced. He tossed it at Galaxia, who catches it in his palms.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Very good. I knew we would both get what we want in the end. Release them.&rdquo; The troops untied Trent and Sally. They quickly ran to join their son.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Did you know what you have done Wu Fei?&rdquo; Trent scolded.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But I had to save you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too dangerous to fall into the wrong hands!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yessss....&rdquo; Galaxia said as he stared at the locket. &ldquo;Finally I possess it! The source to all the power in Arlia!&rdquo; Then he laughed evilly.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late...&rdquo; Trent moaned hopelessly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re doomed.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Galaxia continued laughing hysterically, eyes fixed on the source of all power in Arlia. Soon, he will be the most powerful Sayan in the universe. He put the locket over his head and let it slid down to his neck. From his pocket he produced a golden key. Everybody watched him curiously. He opened the locket, and inside was a heart shaped figure. At the center of it was a hole where the key would be inserted. He inserted the key and a miracle happened.</p></p>

<p><p>A bright light shot out from the locket and the energy engulfed Galaxia completely. He was glowing and more powerful than ever...Everybody winced at the light but Galaxia could only laugh.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha! Finally! I have all the power I ever wanted!&rdquo; The entire building began to shake.</p></p>

<p><p>The Fei family was wise enough to get the hell outta there while they can. Once outside, they turned back. The building exploded. Kaboom! Emperor Galaxia stood amongst the debris, laughing like he never laughed before. &ldquo;I am invincible!&rdquo; Then he turned his sights at the Fei&rsquo;s. He approached them slowly, not being cautious at all.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What do you want now?&rdquo; Wu Fei asked defensively.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for you to die.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hold on! You promised to let them go!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, but I did. But I didn&rsquo;t say after that I would not kill all of you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tyrant!&rdquo; Wu Fei yelled.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Die!&rdquo; Galaxia blasted at them, and all of them jumped out of the way.</p></p>

<p><p>Wu Fei fired an energy at him, but it disintegrated once it touched the emperor's shield. He was totally shocked. Galaxia fired another energy wave at him, this time it hit Wu Fei and destroyed the ground around him. The wave knocked him back a few feet, and he landed on his back.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No!&ldquo; Trent Fei screamed. He ran towards Galaxia like there was no tomorrow. Galaxia fired an energy ball at him, Trent jumped and the ball hit the ground. Trent made a fist in mid-air and the emperor jumped out of the way, and his fist dug into the ground, making a deep hole.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; the tyrant screamed. He charged at Trent at full speed and dug his fist into the old man&rsquo;s face. Trent punched back, first in the face then his guts. It barely hurt him. Galaxia dodged his next attack, and blasted the old man against a wall.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Trent!&rdquo; Sally yelled.</p></p>

<p><p>Trent was injured, but he kept on going. Galaxia laughed. &ldquo;I must say, your determination is astounding! But you have no brains!&rdquo; Trent made his final attack, a powerful beam that hit Galaxia. It only hurt him a bit, and angered him. &ldquo;Damn you peasant!&rdquo; he yelled, and blasted Trent in his stomach. Energy sparks flew everywhere. Trent fell for the last time. Galaxia flew into the air. &ldquo;With my new found powers, I don&rsquo;t need to waste my time with you!&rdquo; Then he left.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; Wu Fei said as he ran to the fallen warrior. He bent down and lifted Trent&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;Speak to me!&rdquo; Sally joined them. She was crying.</p></p>

<p><p>Trent coughed out blood. &ldquo;Uhhh...I&rsquo;m not going to make it...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes you will!&rdquo; he said with tears on his eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Listen Wu Fei...you must take the locket back...you have to stop Galaxia at all costs!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Father? Father...? Father!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Now that the emperor finally had the locket in his possession and gained ultimate power, he went on a rampage...on his own city. No one in Ethiopia was safe.</p></p>

<p><p>Galaxia laughed in the air and his voice echoed throughout the area. &ldquo;I am invincible!&rdquo; He fired an energy ball at one of the buildings and it blew up. As if an addiction, he kept on destroying the buildings, one by one at first, but then many at a time as he fired non stop. Explosions were everywhere. When finished, he flew to another area and continued. KABOOM! BOOM! BAM! &ldquo;My destiny has finally been met! Now there is no one that can stop me now!&rdquo; BOOM!</p></p>

<p><p>One of the royal elite soldiers flew into the air to join the emperor. &ldquo;Emperor Galaxia? What do you think you are you doing?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What does it look like I&rsquo;m doing? This is my city...&rdquo; he answered in a get-the-hell-out-of-my-way tone.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Have you gone mad Emperor?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve built this city and I can destroy it at anytime.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Stop it Emperor! What has gotten into you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Out of my way incompetent idiot!&rdquo; Galaxia blasted his own royal guard and he fell onto the ground and died.</p></p>

<p><p>Wu Fei walked along the empty street, not looking at the damage the emperor has done. Things were cracked everywhere-buildings, floors, and windows. He continued and went into an alley. Suddenly he stopped and pounded one of his fists against the brick wall. He pounded again and it cracked. He was sad and mostly pissed off. There was no word to describe how he felt...his father had been killed for god&rsquo;s sake! He just wanted to find that bastard and rip his off literally.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly he felt hands covered his eyes. &ldquo;Guess who?&rdquo; asked a cherry voice from behind. He recognized it immediately and removed her hands. Then stepped forward.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What do you want Margarita?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What kind of question is that? I&rsquo;ve been looking for you for the past three days, and finally found you! This means we were destined to be together...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Wu Fei sighed and pressed his head against the brick wall. Then he turned around. &ldquo;Do you want something?&rdquo; he asked uncheerfully.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Is something wrong Wu Fei?&rdquo; she asked in concern.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Does it look like something is wrong?&rdquo; he shouted in angry sarcasm. &ldquo;My father has been killed by Galaxia!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A look of shock filled her face. Then sadness and guilt. &ldquo;...I&rsquo;m sorry...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Galaxia that bastard will die!&rdquo; he said, and raised his fists. Power surged throughout his body and he released it in an angry scream. Rock fragments on the ground start shaking and floated in the air, then broke apart. Windows cracked and the brick wall cracked.</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita stared at him in amazement. She had never seen a power like this before...not even close. The energy around his body was glowing and expanding as he controlled it. Then when tired he powered down and fell on his knees. He banged his fists on the ground and screamed, &ldquo;Father!&rdquo; He got back up and Margarita saw he was crying.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wu Fei...&rdquo; She couldn&rsquo;t finish. She walked towards him. He put his head on her shoulder and cried. She hugged him back.</p></p>

<p><p>As Sally mourned the death of her lover, as the crazy Emperor continued his rampage on Ethiopia City. There was no one who would or could stop him.</p></p>

<p><p>When he was tired of it, he went back to the palace and sat on his chair. He waited in the darkness, playing with the locket. Its amazing...a simple piece of jewelry like this can have so much power. It is said that those who possess Quon Fei&rsquo;s locket and knows its secret will have the ultimate power of Sayans...and Galaxia has it. He was named Galaxia because his parents thought he was destined to rule the galaxy. That day had finally came. Today Arlia, tomorrow the galaxy, and soon the universe.</p></p>

<p><p>The night air blew from the balcony to him. But it didn&rsquo;t feel cold tonight. Not at all. With the locket by his side, he felt he was protected from anything, invulnerable to all the dangers of the world.</p></p>

<p><p>The door slammed open, distracting his thoughts. Margarita walked in rudely towards him. The back of the throne chair was facing her. He ignored her rudeness.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Is it true?&rdquo; she asked, assuming that he knew what she was talking about. She was right.</p></p>

<p><p>He pretended to not know. &ldquo;Is what true?&rdquo; he asked in an innocent tone that could&rsquo;ve fooled anyone...well, except for Margarita.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You know what I&rsquo;m talking about!&rdquo; she said angrily.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Did you kill Wu Fei&rsquo;s father?&rdquo; she said, cutting the bullshit.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Why, what makes you say that? Where did you hear it from?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She knew if he knew she was outside she would get in deep trouble. She was granted permission to leave the palace only by him, unless it was an international meeting. But she didn&rsquo;t care this time. He had gone too far. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve talked to him.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wu Fei?!&rdquo; he asked in an outburst.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; she said fearlessly.</p></p>

<p><p>He got up and turned around, angry. Then he snarled. &ldquo;You have been associating with peasants!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ahh screw you! Why did you have to do it? Why? Wasn&rsquo;t the locket enough? You had to go kill the old man.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That fool had to stand in my way. I had no other choice.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Another lame excuse.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Galaxia took a few steps towards her. &ldquo;Lady I have had it with your attitude! General Margarita, I tried to be nice to you before but I guess some people just never change!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ahh, I&rsquo;ve always been like this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Things are going to change around her. Permanently.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she asked nervously.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now that I have the locket in my hands there is not a single soul on Arlia who can defeat me. I will make my race strong and proud, the way we were meant to be!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I will start a purification of the Sayans.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Purification? Have you gone mad?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;All the weakest of us will be eliminated, keeping only the strongest of us alive. And soon our race will become the strongest.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Uh-oh, she thought. The word &ldquo;eliminated&rdquo; was self-explanatory. She was certain this locket had made him mad, and this time its permanent. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You are not doing what you plan to do, not if I can help it.&rdquo; She made a punch and he blocked it. He moved so fast she didn&rsquo;t know her fist was in his hand until she felt it. He squeezed her fist and let go, and she stumbled backwards as if pushed. He powered up, summoning every bit of energy inside of him to the outside. She could feel his power...it was incredible...even more powerful than Wu Fei. For the first time she realized he was superior and she had to know her place. It was a Sayan instinct.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to try that again?&rdquo; he said, this time in a not so calm voice.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No. I'm sorry.&rdquo; It was one of the rare times when she apologized. She stepped back, then turned around, head for the door, and closed it.</p></p>

<p><p>Galaxia was totally satisfied. Even Margarita is afraid of him now! Ahhh the feeling of true power...</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita and Wu Fei waited by the same alley they met the other day, doing nothing but just standing there. Finally, Wu Fei broke the silence.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to kill that bastard for my father...it is the least I can do.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure about this?&rdquo; she asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;More sure than anything in my life. I don&rsquo;t care if he&rsquo;s the emperor. He is going down. But I need your help to get into the Imperial Palace.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wu Fei...he is too powerful for you! If you fight him he will beat you easily!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve experienced it for myself...his power from the locket is unbeatable...there is nothing you can do.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I have to try.&rdquo; he said, conceited.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No! Don&rsquo;t you understand? You are no match for him!&rdquo; she yelled.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Are you helping me or not?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wu Fei...I care about your safety...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Very well. Goodbye.&rdquo; he said harshly, then started to walk away, then she grabbed his wrist, and he half-turned around.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; she said sadly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me...I&rsquo;ve got nobody left...nobody! Nobody loves me anymore...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>His attitude changed entirely. He finally realized how mean he was to her, and how she didn&rsquo;t mind. He was angry, yes, but that didn&rsquo;t entitle him not to love her...because he did. In that moment he lost all anger as he looked into her eyes. &ldquo;...I love you...&rdquo; he said. Then they hugged. She was crying.</p></p>

<p><p>When they hugged emotional, their energies combined together, forming around them in a protective layer. Margarita nor Wu Fei had felt anything like this before. The energy felt so warm and safe to her, making her forget about the troubles of her world, forgetting about everything. They were so deep that they didn&rsquo;t even notice something exploded in the background. Galaxia was at it again. At this very moment, without having to say a word, they knew they were meant for each other.</p></p>

<p><p>They looked into each other&rsquo;s eyes and kissed, and the feeling intensified. Their energies felt stronger than ever, making everything else in the outside world seem like nothing. They were so absorbed into each other that they felt they could do anything, and it seemed all their problems have been solved. The world seemed only like a background to them, nothing more than an illusion...</p></p>

<p><p>The Emperor was still sitting at that very spot, examining the necklace, when the general walked in. This time, she didn&rsquo;t open the doors so rudely, in fact, she knocked before slowly opening the doors.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Are you there, Emperor?&rdquo; she asked nicely.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What is it, general?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ummm...&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t know what to say.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Have you come to make trouble again?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Trouble...no...no trouble at all. In fact, I came here to congratulate you, emperor.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Congratulate me? For what?&rdquo; he asked suspiciously.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Why, on your new found powers of course! What else do you think I mean?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Are you up to something? You usually do not talk like this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Do I always have to be up to something?&rdquo; she asked humorously. &ldquo;After all you <em>are </em>the Emperor, and I should talk with respect to you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>So, she has finally learned her lesson, Galaxia thought. &ldquo;So you finally learned some respect.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Of course...well will be married soon...how else should I be to you?&rdquo; She walked closer, and he grew more suspicious. She put her arms around his chest and hugged him.</p></p>

<p><p>At first, he was tense and nervous. But then he realized there is nothing to be nervous about. How irrational. Margarita is rebellious, but she wouldn&rsquo;t go too far. Everything was going perfectly.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I must admit...I disagreed with you taking the locket, but I didn&rsquo;t realize the hidden powers it possesses. What a naive fool I have been.&rdquo; she said in a convincing voice.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, this locket is amazing.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Can you let me see it?&rdquo; she asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My locket? What do you need it for?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I just want to see it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to see.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Come on! I just want to take a peek, its not like I&rsquo;m going to steal it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He sighed. &ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; What the hell, he thought, it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to let her see it. He reluctantly took out his locket and gave it to her.</p></p>

<p><p>She examined it with fascination, as if it were the first time she saw it. (and it wasn&rsquo;t) &ldquo;Ohhh it looks magnificent.&rdquo; she complimented.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now do you mind I have some things to do.&rdquo; He stuck out his hand, gesturing he wants it back now.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So do I.&rdquo; she said, and stuck her hand into her pocket, then took it out, and fling a bunch of sand at his face.</p></p>

<p><p>He moaned as his eyes can&rsquo;t see. She ran like hell for the exit, made it, ran like hell down the stairs, and continued. &ldquo;Guards!&rdquo; he yelled.</p></p>

<p><p>The troops at the second-to-last exit barricaded her. She didn&rsquo;t stop running and zoomed past through them, knocking them down. Only seconds away from the last exit. The locket was held tightly in her fist. This time, she had to fight her way through. Galaxia stepped in and fired a big energy wave at them, knocking everybody down, even Margarita, who dropped the locket. It made a clinging sound. She got up quickly and escaped.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That traitor...she had escaped, but at least I still have the locket.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Wu Fei and Margarita on the very same rooftop that he was standing on when he first received the locket from his father. For the past few hours they have not said anything to each other, not a word. The skies were especially clear tat day. The clouds looked beautiful. Its a shame Wu Fei&rsquo;s mood was still the same.</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita broke the silence this time. &ldquo;Wu Fei, I...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You failed to steal the locket.&rdquo; he interrupted. His voice was cruel and harsh. It made no difference if he said <strong>great going you idiot.</strong></p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok. You did your best. There is only one thing left to do. We will go and attack Galaxia together.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You can still go back if you change your mind.&rdquo; she said pleadingly.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go back.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He is too powerful for you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re scared you can stay behind and I will go myself without your help.&rdquo; he shouted.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...we go together. It is the least I can do.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Margarita...I know what I am up against. I am not afraid to die fighting.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sally was wandering the streets somewhere, weeping for the loss of her husband and missing son. She walked directionless, wherever her feet took her.</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita and a person covered in a sac walked towards the entrance to the palace. The sac had two holes for the prisoner&rsquo;s eyes and he was tied up, with her holding the end of the rope. The identity of the prisoner was, yep, you guessed it. This would be the perfect plan.</p></p>

<p><p>The Imperial Palace was everything Wu Fei expected, even better. He had come here once before, but that was at night. The scenery was totally different during the day. The palace was installed on a small island away from the mainland. The way to the main entrance was the bridge, in which they are walking on now. The water was a clear blue color. The river separated the two mainlands apart, and the only way to get to either side was by boat or the Ancient One&rsquo;s Bridge.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;General Margarita?&rdquo; one of the guards said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who is the other?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Just some idiot who tried to attack today. I&rsquo;m going to send him to the filthiest dungeon there is.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Can we see him?&rdquo; the other guard asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That will not be necessary.&rdquo; he said in her authoritive voice.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry general. It is Emperor Galaxia&rsquo;s orders. No one leaves or enters the castle without being identified.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>(Damn that Galaxia...) she thought. (Now what?) &ldquo;What kind of an order is this? How come I was not notified about this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He just made this new policy today, right after you left, general.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We are just doing our jobs. If you&rsquo;d kindly show this prisoner&rsquo;s face.&rdquo; the other one said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; she said, half-smiling. She took the sac off Wu Fei&rsquo;s head, then threw it away.</p></p>

<p><p>The first one recognized him immediately. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Wu Fei!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo; he said. His hands were not tied at all; the rope was merely wrapped around his wrists. He pulled his hands apart, and the rope fell on the ground. Without having a chance to react, the first guard was punched by Wu Fei and fell, and didn&rsquo;t get up. The other guard swung his spear at him, he ducked, knocked the spear off his hand, and POW! The other guard fell into the river with a splash.</p></p>

<p><p>They rammed down the front door, expecting to find more guards. They made short work of their foes and continued running towards Galaxia&rsquo;s private hallway.</p></p>

<p><p>The Emperor was standing on the balcony, cursing out the general in his mind. (Margarita you traitor! How dare you betray me.) He took the locket out of his clothes and stared at it.</p></p>

<p><p>Finally, they have made to the door which Margarita opened rudely to interrupt the Emperor from time to time. Galaxia should be in the dark hallway, sitting on his chair like a bum as usually, she thought.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Margarita...I guess this is it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Galaxia should be inside.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;There is no turning back now. I must do what I have to do.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I understand.&rdquo; she said.</p></p>

<p><p>They kissed, and it was brief one, but it was just as good as the few ones before. When they stopped, they turned from each other and looked at the large double doors. Suddenly, the right one collapsed, falling. Wu Fei screamed and the door fell on him. CREAK!</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;WU FEI!&rdquo; she yelled.</p></p>

<p><p>Galaxia jumped and landed atop of the falling door, where Wu Fei was under. (Ouch) Margarita reacted with instinct. She got into fighting position. Galaxia laughed evilly. &ldquo;Welcome back traitor!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You! Get off him!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He smiled. &ldquo;Humph. You never showed me any respect, general. You were always rebellious. But I never expected you would go this far, Margarita.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is your own fault! You&rsquo;ve caused enough trouble here already.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wrong! It is that old man&rsquo;s fault in the first place. If only he did not try to stop me. Now his son is taking his footsteps, to his death! And you, you have the same brains as them. Did you really think you could come here and kill me?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re nothing without that precious locket!&rdquo; Her right hand drew back, forming a ball of energy around it. With a sudden thrust forward, the ray flew at Galaxia. He jumped into the air, leaving the ray hitting the other door, busting a hole. He glided in the air like an eagle. She fired again and again, missing him. He flew down, only a few feet from the floor. She fired again, and missed. He flew towards her, extended his arms, firing a double beam. She leaped aside and evaded the attack. He landed, then ran at her. They hit each other a few times then jumped back, keeping the distance. Mini seconds passed by, and they were at it again. He fired, she jumped up, then he vanished. He reappeared in front of her, surprising her instincts. POW! He punched her up, and she went through the ceiling and up into the sky. She forced herself to stop and did. Suddenly, he was behind her, and knocked her down. In the middle of the fall, her eyes focused suddenly, and she forced herself to stop falling. He appeared in front of her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha! Had enough? I was just getting started.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She grunted angrily and made a punch, and he blocked it. Then she attacked with her other hand, and he blocked that too. She kept punching furiously.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for your end traitor!&rdquo; he said as he stopped her fists. Being a second too slow, Margarita hit his chest then his cheek. He hit back with devastating force. She was knocked up high. He flew after her and gave her a knee in the stomach, then put both his fists together and slammed them down on her back, sending her crashing on the ground.</p></p>

<p><p>Wu Fei&rsquo;s left fingers were sticking out of the door, started moving. His fingers gathered into a fist and the fallen door flipped over. He stood up and powered up.</p></p>

<p><p>Galaxia floated in the air and crossed his arms, thinking he has already won. Suddenly Margarita popped out of the smoke and flew in front of him. She did an aerial kick and he dodged it perfectly. She tried twice more then stopped. She fired a large energy meteor at him. He blocked and it blew up. She kept firing the meteors non-stop until Galaxia was covered by smoke. Her hands were getting tired and she was running out of energy, but she kept going. She stopped for a break, then fired the big one, a very big energy ball which blew up and lighted up the area. He popped out of the smoke and rammed into her. She crashed into a building with a boom.</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita recovered from the fall with dust and pebbles on her. Galaxia landed and laughed. &ldquo;You lose!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Not yet!&rdquo; she shouted. She charged at him, only to be knocked back against a wall. He walked towards her and punched. She crossed her arms to stop his fists from hitting her face. Now he was doing it non-stop, and she couldn&rsquo;t stop him. Her back was hitting against the wall and it soon cracked. He kept pushing further and further until they were inside. Margarita popped out from the other side of the building and crashed into another wall. She got up, rested a few seconds, then fell down. Galaxia laughed again.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame...we could have been rulers of Ethiopia. Why did you have to take the stupid path? Now you will have to die with Wu Fei and his father.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He was just about to fire at her when you know who flew out of the palace. &ldquo;Emperor Galaxia!&rdquo; he screamed so loud that perhaps both sides of the river could hear. &ldquo;Your time has come!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re finished Wu Fei!&rdquo; he screamed back.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wu Fei...&rdquo; Margarita said weakly.</p></p>

<p><p>Galaxia flew into the air to join his foe. They charged and hit each other&rsquo;s fists, and a wave of energy broke out. They kept fighting until Galaxia gathered enough energy to blast him. He fired, and Wu Fei flew down to avoid the beam. Now it turned into an air chase. As Wu Fei descended, Galaxia fired again and again. Wu Fei dodged left and right. He flew only a few feet from the water, causing a tidal wave. He went under the Ancient One&rsquo;s Bridge and Galaxia followed. Suddenly he stopped and fired back, but missed. They blasted each other and the destruction was unrepairable. In carelessness, the emperor blew up the bridge, but he didn&rsquo;t even notice. He was focused on destroying his foe, and he will do whatever it takes. &ldquo;You know you are no match for me and my locket!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That locket does not belong to you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita lifted her upper body weakly with her hands. She had lost all strength, and can&rsquo;t even get up. &ldquo;We...can&rsquo;t lose...or else its all over...Wu Fei...&rdquo; She gathered energy for the final attack.</p></p>

<p><p>The two Sayans continued fighting and of course the one with the locket has the advantage.</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita shot a fire ball at the emperor and it flew pass between them and exploded. Galaxia opened his palm and blasted an energy wave and knocked Margarita backwards, making her unconscious. &ldquo;NO!&rdquo; Wu Fei yelled as he charged and punched his foe in the cheeks. He gave his a foe a combo of punches mostly in the chest and stomach, then kneed his stomach, then punched his face again.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Blast you!&rdquo; Galaxia shot a ray at his foe and pushed him backwards, smoke coming from his chest. Then he charged and punched Wu Fei, sending him falling onto the ground. Galaxia laughed evilly and went on a rampage again, shooting energy beams at the buildings for fun.</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita woke up. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve lost? It&rsquo;s all over now...he has won...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Wu Fei half got up, then stumbled clumsily. He fell on his knees and palms. At that moment his mind was filled with thoughts. (I&rsquo;m sorry father...I gave him the locket and you&rsquo;re not here anymore because of me...) His fingers gripped the gravel violently, crushing it into dust. (I can not defeat him, I can not even fulfill your final wish! What can I do now?) His guilt slowly manifested into anger, the kind of deep anger that pushes out all rational thought. That damned emperor murdered my father, and hurt Margarita! He won&rsquo;t...won&rsquo;t get away with this! Galaxia!</p></p>

<p><p>He stood up, finally, and kept looking at the ground. The rock fragments around him floated up and circled around him randomly. He was grunting, showing his teeth and his eyes were dangerous.</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita could sense his power from where she was. It was incredible. It felt almost as strong as Galaxia now. Suddenly, in an outburst, energy released from his body, and it had changed completely.</p></p>

<p><p>Galaxia sensed the power and turned around. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; It was Wu Fei, and he looked different. His hair had changed to golden yellow, and his eyes a dark black color. &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The entire sky became dark, and so did the river and the remains of Ethiopia. The only visible light that could be seen was Wu Fei&rsquo;s energy and Margarita. Both looked at the new Wu Fei with disbelief. &ldquo;Wu Fei?&rdquo; she muttered.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What...what does this mean?&rdquo; The Sayan kept staring at the emperor with those eyes of hatred, as cruel as death.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Its...its true!&rdquo; Margarita said in disbelief and joy. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the Super Sayan!&rdquo; Wu Fei powered up. &ldquo;So the legend is true...it is true. The sacred scrolls do not lie. It said that whenever evil would take over Arlia, a savior will come out of nowhere and rescue the planet. This warrior would be the Super Sayan, a fighter with powers beyond comprehension. Ethiopia has reached its dark hour...and the savior has come at last. He was Wu Fei all this time...I knew there was something special about him.&rdquo; She flashbacked to the time when they were in the alley, he was so angry that he released his power. She felt it alright. There was something special about him, only she didn't&rsquo; know what. But now it makes sense. It made perfect sense. She didn&rsquo;t know why, but she knew everything was going to be OK.</p></p>

<p><p>Wu Fei leaped into the air as quick as lightning and punched the totally unsuspected Galaxia. Now the two forces seemed even. Galaxia fought back equally and every time they hit each other a loud bang could be heard everywhere.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Good luck Wu Fei...&rdquo; Margarita said.</p></p>

<p><p>The Super Sayan fired a golden beam of light at Galaxia, who winced from the light then got hit real bad. In an outrage he fired back repeatedly, wasting his energy. &ldquo;I will not lose!&rdquo; The Sayan dodged all of his attacks swiftly. Suddenly, a flashback hit him like cold ice. It was something the wizard had said earlier.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Beware, Emperor, for you are not entirely invulnerable to all the Sayans.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; the Emperor asked strangely.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;One day a Super Sayan will emerge and challenge your power! Just beware, for he poses the ultimate challenge to you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The wide-eyed Galaxia froze in disbelief. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s..it&rsquo;s him! He is the legend!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The Super Sayan positioned himself in front of Galaxia. &ldquo;Its over tyrant! This ends now!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;NOOOOOOOOO!&rdquo; Galaxia screamed madly. He gathered all his strength and energy. Wu Fei followed.</p></p>

<p><p>They fired at each other, their beams zoomed passed and hit their targets. At the moment everything froze and the sky lit up literally. Two bright balls emerged and exploded in the air. Galaxia fell into the river and Wu Fei slowly descended. His hair turned back to normal and then he smiled. He landed on the shoreline and didn&rsquo;t move.</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita ran to her injured lover despite her injuries. She bent down and lifted up his head. &ldquo;Wu Fei! Wu Fei! Speak to me!&rdquo; Blood was gushing from the corner of his mouth. He coughed.</p></p>

<p><p>The sky turned gray and start snowing.</p></p>

<p><p>Wu Fei opened his eyes and spoke weakly. &ldquo;Margarita...you&rsquo;re still here...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Of course I am! Where else would I be? I will always be at your side. Always!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Margar-rita..&ldquo; He grunted painfully. &ldquo;Ohhhh...&rdquo; Then coughed blood.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wu Fei!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Galaxia is gone now. So is the locket with him.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I know! You did great. You are the bravest man I have ever known.&rdquo; The snow drifted softly on her hair and her cape. One of the flakes dropped on his cheek.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The threat is finally...over...Ethiopia can now live in...&rdquo; He coughed. &ldquo;...peace...Thank you for everything. Thank you for the love you have given me.&rdquo; he said without regret.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What are you talking about silly?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I...don&rsquo;t have much time left. I will join my father soon.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;NO! You can&rsquo;t die! You can&rsquo;t just leave me here!&rdquo; She was crying now.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Margarita...sorry it had to end like this. I was hardly nice to you because of what happened to my father. And now it&rsquo;s all over.&rdquo; He reached out his hand She took it and held it firmly.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me Wu Fei! From the first day I saw you I knew we were destined for each other!&rdquo; The tears were dripping quickly.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I will never...forget...you...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;NO! WU FEI!&rdquo; His eyes closed and his head tilted down. &ldquo;NO! NOOOOO!&rdquo; She put him in her arms and cried. More snow fell on them, and all of Ethiopia.</p></p>

<p><p>Margarita knelt down beside Wu Fei&rsquo;s grave on the dirty ground. She placed a flower in front of the stone neatly. Tears filled her eyes. She put a hand on the stone and rubbed it gently.</p></p>

<p><p>Inscribed on his grave was a few words written in Sayan language. It said:</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Here lies Wu Fei, savior of Ethiopia, and the first Super Sayan&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>It was still snowing. The drift seemed endless.</p></p>

<p><p>From the corner of her eye, she saw Sally and Terrence watching her. Sally fell on her knees and cried. &ldquo;No, not my son too! Why, why, why?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Terrence put a hand on her shoulder. &ldquo;He was a brave man.&rdquo; He was crying too. &ldquo;And my best friend!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p> Margarita took out Quon Fei&rsquo;s locket and stared at it. &ldquo;I will never forget you Wu Fei. I will never forget the sacrifice you made for me and Ethiopia.&rdquo; She took out the golden key that activated the locket. &ldquo;This thing should be destroyed, but...it&rsquo;s the only thing I have of you.&rdquo; She dug up dirt in front of the grave and placed the key into the small pit. She put the dirt on top of it and flattened it, evening it. She put the locket back into her pocket. &ldquo;Rest in peace, my love.&rdquo;</p>
