<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="a">[ A ] - The Copy Cat Assassin </span></p></center>

<p><p>The GP space pod launched into the sky, entering earth&rsquo;s atmosphere within minutes. It&rsquo;s course is set for the GP Station, a place where dangerous criminals are locked up for a long, long time. Inside the GP space pod, Angela was sitting across from Blue, the criminal who was arrested. He was handcuffed on the wrists and ankles with special titanium cuffs made by the Galactic Police. Angela was sitting crossed legged and crossed arm with her eyes closed.</p></p>

<p><p>Even though she did not want to look at Blue, she has to be in the same room as him to make sure he doesn&rsquo;t do any funny business. It will take one hour before they reach the station in space.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue was still battered and bruised from his fight with Tyson. &ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo; Blue blurted out. &ldquo;It should not have ended this way.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson took the claw in his hands and smashed it into the claw that was holding his stomach captive. *Clang* Now he was free, and he flew away. The situation has changed &ndash; now that Blue has one less claw he can use.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue got angry and started to fire beams. They all missed Tyson, who didn&rsquo;t even dodge. He formed the energy disk in his palm and threw it at Blue, and it cut off three of his claws. *Slash*</p></p>

<p><p>Without any balance, he fell down. &ldquo;Ugh! This can&rsquo;t be happening.&rdquo; The claws retracted back into his backpack.</p></p>

<p><p>The super sayan approached him. Blue, without his claws, is no match for a super sayan. &ldquo;No wait&#8230;can&rsquo;t we talk about this first?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What is there to talk about?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s settle this like gentlemen!&rdquo; Blue blurted out in a desperate tone of voice. &ldquo;We have no grudges with each other.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Why should I care what you have to say?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Blue fired a beam at the ground, blowing smoke into Tyson&rsquo;s face, and he ran away. Suddenly Tyson appeared in front of him, causing Blue to gasp in surprise.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I should&rsquo;ve known you&rsquo;re a coward.&rdquo; Tyson gave him a good punch in the face, one that will give him nightmares later on. *Kapow* Blue sure felt it good, it&rsquo;s one of those bone shattering punches that leaves a bruise for a while. Tyson then punched him in the chest, breaking some of his ribs, knocking him into the ground.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve&#8230;lost?&rdquo; Blue murmured in shock. This is the first time he has felt such pain, and not to mention the first time he lost a fight.</p></p>

<p><p>As he reflected on his defeat, Blue grew depressed. &ldquo;Damn him. How could I have been beaten by a mere sayan?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Angela had a naughty smirk on her face. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have plenty of time to think about it in jail.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>After going through the worst battle of their lives, Tyson and Faith have earned some well-deserved rest and quiet time. Blue has just been arrested by Angela, and is taken inside a space pod that launched into the sky. The lovers stared into each other&rsquo;s eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tyson...&rdquo; Faith murmured in a dream-like state.</p></p>

<p><p>At this point, there was no need for words. They leaned in close and close their eyes and kissed passionately. Faith has been through a lot, much more than words can describe, but all that is over now. Tyson&rsquo;s kiss and embrace practically melted all her troubles and worries away. His arms are strong and muscular, and they held her lower back tightly, pressing her body against his. Those arms have saved her life many times, and she feels safe and secure in his embrace, and she can just melt in his arms.</p></p>

<p><p>Her arms were wrapped around his neck, pulling his head closer as they kissed, and they played with his hair. Tyson is a reliable man, and at times, she can lean on him, sometimes in the literal sense. By now, she is exhausted and even standing up is tiring, but she can lean on his sturdy body.</p></p>

<p><p>When they finally finished kissing, they still do not want to let go. She embraced him and they were cheek to cheek.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I miss you.&rdquo; said Faith, almost crying. &ldquo;I miss you so much!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re safe and sound.&rdquo; he replied. Then they release the embrace to look at each other.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I thought I would never see you again.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson saw that her eyes were shaking. Those eyes told him much more than words can ever tell - that her words were literally true - there was a chance she might not see him again because she could have died. Indeed, those eyes told him everything - they were the eyes of someone who has been through hell and back, and she just wants some peace and quiet with the one she loves.</p></p>

<p><p>Now it all makes sense. When Faith first got off the spaceship, she was wearing nothing but a towel, and Tyson never thought about why. But now that he thought about it, it all makes sense. They must have done some horrible things to her on that ship.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh Faith. I&rsquo;m sorry for not being there for you. I should&rsquo;ve been there.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Those words struck a cord in her heart like never before. &ldquo;Tyson...&rdquo; She just stared at him with those puppy dog eyes. She had so much to say, but no words came out.</p></p>

<p><p>These two have had intimate moments like this before, but each and every time, it feels unique and special, every moment was greater than the previous one. The same holds true for this moment. It&rsquo;s as if the whole world is melting away, and they are the only ones left on earth. They are the center of each other&rsquo;s universe.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson put his hands on hers, as they cling onto the towel. But in the moment, Faith forgot that she was standing outside in the forest. All she can see was Tyson directly in front of her. She loves him and trusts him completely, and will gladly do as he says in a heartbeat. Tyson slowly and gently pulled her hands to the side, and she did not resist at all, and the towel dropped on the grass.</p></p>

<p><p>As he stared into her eyes, she stared into his, and they stayed like that for a while. Faith&rsquo;s heart was beating rapidly, and every second that passed by she thought her heart would jump out of her chest.</p></p>

<p><p>As she waited anxiously, he leaned in close and kissed her lips. Then he put his face in her shoulder and smelled her. Then Tyson kissed her skin while she moaned slightly. Then he put his face in her cleavage and he wrapped his arms around her back. She moaned some more as he snuggled her breasts.</p></p>

<p><p>The sensation was too much for Faith and she grew weak in the knees. She fell backwards, while at the same time, Tyson leaned forward, and they fell down on the grass. *Plop* Falling down like this feels natural, as if it&rsquo;s supposed to happen. The man should be on top of the woman, as he is in control in this position.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson started to kiss her in various places, like her breasts and her neck, gently gliding his lips along her skin. At this point, they have forgotten where they are, and they were too overtaken by lust to stop. They both need each other and they must have it now, so they will continue until they&rsquo;re satisfied.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith grabbed Tyson&rsquo;s shirt as he did what he pleased. Then her hand let go of his shirt and pulled the grass. Tyson grew more aggressive as he is more turned on, and she squirmed a lot, moaning out loud. Her head tossed about and she pulled the grass harder, and her legs thrashed about.</p></p>

<p><p>Today, the sun is shining brightly, the grass is green, and the wind provided a comfortable breeze. It is the perfect weather for a picnic, or what they&rsquo;re doing now.</p></p>

<p><p>In the sky, over the area where the fight between Tyson and Blue happened, something appeared. An invisible spaceship just removed its camouflage and became visibele. The pilot, a man wearing a white robe, sat on the captain&rsquo;s chair. &ldquo;What is our altitude, Spidey?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sir. We are inside of earth&rsquo;s atmosphere and we are approximately 2 miles above the ground.&rdquo; <strong>Spidey</strong> replied.</p></p>

<p><p>He is a scientist who serves as the ship&rsquo;s engineer, as well as one of the major developers of the squad&rsquo;s technology. The assassins can wear invisible suits thanks to his research. What is most unique about Spidey, however, is his appearance. He has a smaller frame than most, and due to the fact that he hunches back all the time, he seems even shorter. He wears these goggles over this eyes all the time, which is also his own invention. The goggles are metallic and they can actually extend themselves to become binoculars.</p></p>

<p><p>Due to his nature, he is seldom sent to assassination missions. But little does everyone else know, he is probably most violent and sadistic one out of the group. The only thing more twisted than his appearance is his mind, as no one really knows what he&rsquo;s scheming.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So, Blue was arrested.&rdquo; said <strong>Indigo</strong>. &ldquo;How rare it is for him to mess up. The man who defeated Blue must be something.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Indigo is the man who was sitting on the captain&rsquo;s chair, calmly giving orders and analyzing the situation. Unlike other members of the squad who wear black, he prefers to wear a white robe. He has a mustache and slight beard on his chin, and his hair is the shape of a palm tree.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He is a sayan warrior named Tyson Spade.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;A sayan? Hmmm...&rdquo; Indigo put a hand on his chin to think.</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;Sir, his last recorded power level was over 100,000.&rdquo; said Spidey.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ohh? That&rsquo;s pretty good, yet he is no match for someone like me, the Copy Cat Assassin. Spade should still be in the area. Do a search within a 10km radius.&rdquo; said Indigo.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh heh. Sir, I found someone with a power level of 3,000. It&rsquo;s nearby.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ohhh. Let&rsquo;s get a visual.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The computer screen did a scan and showed a live feed of the hills. There was miniature man lying on the grass. Spidey did a zoom in and the screen revealed the man to be Tyson.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmm, wasn&rsquo;t he with a woman?&rdquo; Indigo asked. &ldquo;What does the radar say?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange. She&rsquo;s supposed to be here. In the exact same position as him. Hmmm.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Zoom in closer. How come he&rsquo;s lying there?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;s injured from the fight?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>As the computer screen zoomed in, and the resolution became clearer, they saw a woman underneath Tyson.</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey&rsquo;s goggles extended all the way and nearly popped up. &ldquo;Ohhh, what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; He put his face closer to the screen.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh. It is a mating ritual of earthlings. It&rsquo;s nothing special, really. Except for the fact that they are doing it outdoors. Usually they want some privacy.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say! How daring of them!&rdquo; Spidey was turned on by this. It&rsquo;s as if he&rsquo;s watching PG-13 porn.</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey made the computer zoom in on the couple, and now he can see everything in detail. There&rsquo;s even audio coming from the speakers. [&ldquo;Ugh! Tyson!&rdquo; moaned the woman]. The man was topless and wearing blue pants, and his body covered the woman&rsquo;s privates, but one can tell she was naked. The man kept kissing and biting her all over, while she made noises that turned Spidey on. The woman&rsquo;s legs were between his legs and they thrashed about.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah, that&rsquo;s right baby!&rdquo; he mumbled. Spidey was more excited than the couple was, watching the whole thing without batting an eyelash. He&rsquo;s always wanted to study the anatomy of humans, and now, he gets a front row seat to human mating ritual.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah! Yeah that&rsquo;s it! Hehe.&rdquo; Spidey zoomed in on her legs. &ldquo;Oh baby...&rdquo; The woman&rsquo;s naked legs kept thrashing about as she moaned. Sometimes they brushed against Tyson&rsquo;s pants and sometimes they kicked the grass.</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey then scrolled up and the screen focused on her left arm. He watched as her fingers squeezed the grass as tight as possible. He was getting more excited, treating this like a porn show. He kept scrolling up and the screen showed Tyson&rsquo;s face on her breasts. Faith was moaning and her head was tossing and turning. Her face showed pleasure and pain, her eyes were closed and she was wincing, her lips were slightly ajar... and she reacted to everything the man did to her.</p></p>

<p><p>He then split the screen into four parts. The top left corner showed Faith&rsquo;s fingers squeezing the grass. The bottom left showed her feet. She was in ecstasy and her toes were curling. The top right corner showed Faith&rsquo;s face. The bottom right showed their waist level. Tyson was moving his hips up and down against her hips, and she moaned in reaction to it.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Spidey.&rdquo; said Indigo. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you rather witness it in person?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The couple was still making love on the grass. Tyson, now shirtless, was snuggling his face into Faith&rsquo;s breasts. Even though he was taking it slow, it was still intense for the both of them. She moaned with her eyes closed. Her hands grabbed his back and held onto. But even holding his back was not enough. Her legs kicked the grass.</p></p>

<p><p>As they continued to do it, Faith had a flash back of what happened earlier...</p></p>

<p><p>In the dark room, there was a man sitting in a chair, holding a woman in his arms. It was completely dark except for some lights flaring from the computer screen. The main in the chair is none other than Blue, and there was an unconscious, naked woman in his arms, who turns out to be Faith.</p></p>

<p><p>Due to the absence of light, most of her private parts were covered by the darkness.</p></p>

<p><p>He held her by the shoulder and legs, and sat there with a smirk on his face. It</p></p>

<p><p>was crude to just have her lie there on his waist, completely naked and not covered by anything. But that&rsquo;s the way Blue likes it. Having this helpless woman in his arms makes him feel powerful and in charge.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was not entirely conscious, but she was conscious enough to feel pain. Her eyes were twitching and her lips were quivering from the torment she faced earlier. Her body and mind were exhausted.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue was tired as well, after going all out on this poor woman. Now he is just relaxing, and enjoying holding this woman&rsquo;s body in his arms, which he considers his trophy.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue lifted up her back so that her face met his. He lowered his head and kissed her lips. The barely conscious Faith felt the pain even in this state. But she cannot open her eyes or move any part of her body. He enjoyed it fully, making it an open mouth kiss and forcing her lips apart and swallowing them completely. Her head tilted back from being pushed by his lips, as if he&rsquo;s trying use his mouth to dig into her face.</p></p>

<p><p>Her eyes twitched from the defiling kiss, and light moans came out of her mouth. &ldquo;Mmmmmfffff...mmmmfff...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tears of sadness and pain dripped down the corner of her eyes. Her fingers twitched a little bit, but other than that, she was not able to move at all. All she could do was shed more tears as he violated her. Her tears dropped on the floor soundlessly. Blue enjoyed it very much. She was completely naked and helpless, and violating her like this is the ultimate high.</p></p>

<p><p>He has done more than enough to her. But he still wants more. Everything before this was the entr&eacute;e. And this is the after meal dessert.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue then kissed her neck all over, gliding his lips down to her collarbones. She moaned a little, reacting to Blue&rsquo;s every touch. He then put his face into her breasts and kissed them and tasted them with his lips. . Even though she was mostly unconscious, she still felt everything being done to her. The poor woman was violated so much that she can&rsquo;t even lift a muscle, or open her eyes, or even say a word.</p></p>

<p><p>The computer turned on and a silhouetted face appeared on the screen. &ldquo;Ah Commander Blue...ugh! What are you doing?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Blue removed his face from Faith&rsquo;s breasts. &ldquo;Commander. Don&rsquo;t mind me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is a bad time, I&rsquo;ll call you later.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; said Blue. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ah hem. As you know, there is a reward for Tyson Spade&rsquo;s head, and it&rsquo;s a hefty one.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>As the face spoke, Blue lifted one of Faith&rsquo;s legs and he put her ankle on his against his cheek. He rubbed his cheek and lips against her ankle, and her skin felt good to his lips and smelled good to his nose.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I have done some research on Spade, and he is no ordinary sayan. He has defeated many first class warriors despite his young age. It is no wonder the reward is so hefty.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Blue continued to play with Faith&rsquo;s leg, kissing her ankle and moving down her shin, all the way to the knee. He kept gliding his lips on that area, moving back and forth. Faith let out a weak whimper and her eyes twitched.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Spade is powerful - too powerful for you to handle. I suggest you back out of this mission.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Blue became annoyed, and he put Faith&rsquo;s leg down. &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This mission is too much for you to handle, Commander Blue.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;My Assassin Squad will take care of him. If they fail, I will take care of him personally!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Even with your abilities, your chances of winning are 50/50 at best.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re underestimating me, Commander.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You can try, Blue. But when you lose, don&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t warn you. I think you should stick to what do you best...being a womanizer. Heh heh.&rdquo; The silhouetted face disappeared.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue was angry at those remarks. He became full of adrenaline and his grip on Faith&rsquo;s body tightened. His muscles popped veins and his arms squeezed her shoulders and legs, and she groaned in pain. He squeezed them without any regards to her well being, not caring if he breaks a bone or two, or even crush her completely.</p></p>

<p><p>All he cared about was his anger, and it so happens this unfortunate woman is in his arms at a time like this.</p></p>

<p><p>The pain became more intense...and there was nothing she could do while laying in this villain&rsquo;s arms. Tears dripped from her eyes...and fell to the floor. In Blue&rsquo;s arms, she was nothing but a helpless naked woman, her soft and frail body waiting to be crushed at any moment.</p></p>

<p><p>Her head titled upwards and her mouth opened and she moaned. &ldquo;Ughhhh.&rdquo; Her head tossed and turned and her moaning continued. It was the saddest moan any woman ever let out... it was a cry of pain and misery. It was the cry of a woman who was violated over and over...until she can&rsquo;t even open her eyes. And even in this unconscious state, she still has to suffer.</p></p>

<p><p>Even though it was just a memory, Faith still felt the pain as if it was real, and her fingers squeezed the grass tightly. Tyson was still doing her, but the flashback and images were so intense that she was reliving the past right now. It was so painful that she suppressed the memory, but now all the unconscious sensations that were buried came to the surface to haunt her.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue continued to squeeze Faith&rsquo;s frail body with his arms as he grunted in anger. Faith moaned in agony as her body was being crushed. Blue became so angry that he lost control of himself and became charged with electricity. Faith&rsquo;s body was electrocuted and she screamed louder than ever before. She was being zapped while crushed at the same time, but the electricity was way worse and more deadly. She had never felt anything so painful in her life, and her head tossed and turned non-stop, and she screamed and screamed in the dark, empty room...</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s fingers squeezed the grass tighter, and her legs kicked harder. But the sensations she was feeling in the moment began to break her out of the terrible memories. She felt the sun shining in her face, and Tyson&rsquo;s warm body on top of hers.</p></p>

<p><p>Seconds have passed and her fingers relaxed a bit. The flashback of the dark room started to fade away, and she became synchronized with reality again. All she saw was a flashback, a nightmare, and nothing more. Right now, she&rsquo;s in safe hands.</p></p>

<p><p>In the heat of the moment, their guard was down, and they did not sense two enemies approaching them from the north. Tyson started biting her neck and tt was so intense that her neck was bent backwards and her face was facing the other way. Faith&rsquo;s eyes were closed, but they were opened for a brief instant, and she thought she saw two shadows watching them. She opened her eyes fully to take a closer look, and as it turns out, she was not seeing things. Spidey and Indigo were standing there, watching them. To her, they appear to be upside down because her face was upside down.</p></p>

<p><p> Faith screamed and pushed Tyson&rsquo;s shoulders away. Tyson opened his eyes and looked up and gasped. He got off of Faith and stared at the two like a deer in headlights. Faith crawled backwards to where the towel was and quickly retrieved it to cover her body.</p></p>

<p><p>Indigo spoke up. &ldquo;Sorry to interrupt your little moment.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson stood up. &ldquo;Who the hell are you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith stood up, hiding behind Tyson.</p></p>

<p><p>Indigo: &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re the sayan who defeated Blue, eh?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;You know Blue? Are you an acquaintance of his?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You could say that. He&rsquo;s more of a subordinate than an acquaintance.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in the Assassination Squad!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>While they were talking, Faith was scared for her life, hiding behind Tyson. Her head was peeping out from the side of his shoulder. It wasn&rsquo;t Indigo that she was worried about, it was the other one.</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey was significantly shorter than Indigo, and he was hunched back and his arms dangled off his shoulders. Although he&rsquo;s not a threat as a fighter, to Faith, he is the most dangerous one. His appearance only sent chills down her spine. His tongue was frolicking outside his mouth, and drooling like a dog. His goggles and mechanical limbs make him look more like a freak. Faith can sense something evil and lustful about this creature and it made her scared. His appearance suggests the same thing...he&rsquo;s definitely thinking about doing horrible things to her.</p></p>

<p><p>Not only did she feel chills down her spine, but Faith&rsquo;s body was trembling. Who can blame her, giving the situation? She was clad in nothing but a pink towel. But in front of this creature, she felt naked and exposed. Even though Tyson was in front of her, she can see that Spidey was staring directly at her in a perverted way.</p></p>

<p><p>Indigo: &ldquo;I am the Assassination Squad. And I know all about you, Spade.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Are you here to get revenge for Blue?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Not at all...the idea of revenge just isn&rsquo;t profitable for us.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Then what do you want with me?&rdquo; Tyson asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in you, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; Indigo replied, smirking.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You people make me sick!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson gathered energy and blew up the ground, and smoke was everywhere. Everything in front of them was not visible, so the enemy cannot see them as well.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Faith, run now!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t leave you!&rdquo; she replied.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of this. Go now!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll catch up to you. Just go.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith nodded and went on her way. She was reluctant to go, but nonetheless she did. In her situation, she did not have much of a choice, considering that she&rsquo;s wearing only a towel. Even if she stayed, she would not be able to fight, and only be a burden to Tyson. All she can do now is take cover somewhere until the danger is over.</p></p>

<p><p>Indigo covered his eyes from the dust. &ldquo;Ugh. Trying to run away, huh? Spidey, you capture the woman. I&rsquo;ll take care of the sayan.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey accepted his mission gratefully. &ldquo;With pleasure.&rdquo; He blurred. <br>  Indigo threw a shockwave that blew the smoke away. Now, only him and Tyson remain. Tyson looked left and right and noticed that the smaller guy, Spidey, isn&rsquo;t there. His eyes widened with shock, knowing the small guy is chasing Faith, and that means she&rsquo;s in grave danger.</p></p>

<p><p>While distracted, Indigo blurred and appeared in front of Tyson and punched him in the face. *Pow*</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson stuttered backwards and his head was facing up. Indigo stepped forward and threw another punch, but Tyson caught this one. &ldquo;That ugly looking guy must be your henchmen and he&rsquo;s after Faith. I have to save her!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Worry about yourself!&rdquo; Indigo&rsquo;s hand became charged with purple electricity and Tyson jumped away to avoid touching it. &ldquo;Quick reflexes. I expected nothing less from the man who defeated Commander Blue.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson powered up, his body became surrounded by a beam of blue energy.</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="b">[ B ] - Your Friendly Neighborhood Spidey</span></p></center>

<p> <p>Faith ran as far away as she can from the battle, and despite being exhausted and worn out, she has no choice but to keep running. She sensed that the enemy was right behind her.</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey was chasing her, running on all fours like a gorilla. &ldquo;Heh heh heh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She turned around and saw him. Despite her efforts, he was gaining on her.</p></p>

<p><p>This is a very bad situation for her - she&rsquo;s running away and clinging onto her towel with one hand - being chased by some pervert. She was out of breath and not even given a moment&rsquo;s rest.</p></p>

<p><p>She tripped on a rock and fell flat on her face. *Doosh* Because she was panicking, she was not paying attention.</p></p>

<p><p>A blurry figure ran past her and appeared in front of her as Spidey. &ldquo;Hehe, you&rsquo;re not getting away, little kitten.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Falling down while being chased was a bad idea. Now the pervert was standing in front of her, which was what she feared.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith pushed herself off the ground, kneeling there and staring at him like a helpless sheep about to be eaten by a wolf. One hand was still clinging onto the towel against her breasts, her other hand squeezed the towel between her legs. Her eyes were shaking and her body trembled in fear.</p></p>

<p><p>This man who stands before her, if he is a man at all, is leering at her and he&rsquo;s panting like a dog in heat. Spidey&rsquo;s goggles hid his eyes, and he has a pointy nose and long chin, and his tongue was wet and disgusting. Faith felt violated just by him leering at her.</p></p>

<p><p> Spidey&rsquo;s goggles did a scan of her body. Her power level was shown, and it&rsquo;s a really low number. But that&rsquo;s not what Spidey was interested in. He slowly leered at her from the top to the bottom, examining all her features in detail. His goggles were sticking out as he zoomed in on her breasts. One can tell what he&rsquo;s thinking just by his facial expressions. Then he zoomed in on her thighs. He liked what he saw, and he smiled wickedly.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;S-Stay away...don&rsquo;t come any closer...&rdquo; she whimpered.</p></p>

<p><p>She was in a pinch...a very bad situation. Wearing only a towel and kneeling on her knees, she was unable to run away. But in Spidey&rsquo;s point of view, this was a sexual situation where she&rsquo;s trying to seduce him. He was getting turned on just leering at her figure. Sparkles appeared on her body. She was on her knees, her hand clasped the towel between her legs, while the other hand clenched it to her breasts. She was practically inviting him to ravage her. His favorite thing about her were her eyes. Her eyes were big, and shaking from the fear. To Spidey, her eyes were begging him to approach and do all sorts of things to her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No! Don&rsquo;t come any closer!&rdquo; she cried out desperately.</p></p>

<p><p>Of course, Spidey did the opposite and slowly approached her, with a grabbing gesture. &ldquo;Come here, my little kitten. Hehe.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...no...&rdquo; Faith grew more scared as he approached. She pressed her right hand firmly on her breasts and she breathed hard. Her eyes were shaking and she kneeled there like a deer in headlights.</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey&rsquo;s arm slowly reached for her. His hand was merely a few inches from her face, and not wanting to be touched by this vile creature, Faith instinctively fell backwards.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith crawled away from him as he approached slowly. The danger level was extremely high for her. Not only was she on the ground, but she was practically naked. Her body was clad in only a cotton towel, which was not much. All it takes is one tug to pull it off, and she will be naked...and then it&rsquo;s over for her. Even though the towel covered her body, her legs were mostly exposed, and so was her cleavage.</p></p>

<p><p>She crawled backwards desperately. Her pupils dilated, her eyeballs shaking and she was at a loss of words. His goggles zoomed in on her thighs and what&rsquo;s between them. The view was making him more turned on.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mine!!&rdquo; Spidey then leapt at her like a frog. Faith screamed and shut her eyes and instinctively kicked.</p></p>

<p><p>Her foot landed in his cheek and stopped him from moving closer to her. His hands reached for her, clawing at the air, and Faith kept kicking him over and over, while yelling.</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey grew annoyed and grabbed her ankle and took her foot off his face.</p></p>

<p><p>Now Faith&rsquo;s situation was even worst than before, as now she&rsquo;s lying down and he has one of her legs. He chuckled as he held her leg up. &ldquo;Heh heh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was in a compromising position and desperately wanted to get free. She shook her leg, thrashing about, but his grip was firm. She tried to crawl back some more, but it was no use.</p></p>

<p><p>He raised her right leg and wrapped it with both his arms. Then he lied down backwards, bringing her leg down with him, performing a leglock. This move caused Faith extreme pain and she screamed out loud. It felt as if he was trying to rip her leg off her hips. &ldquo;Aaaaaaah!!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey has been observing earth&rsquo;s television programs for a while, and wrestling caught his attention. When he&rsquo;s off duty, he&rsquo;d spent countless hours watching wrestling. Spidey has always wanted to try this move on someone, but never got the chance to...and what better a practice target than a helpless woman clad in a towel?</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s leg was in great pain, and she moaned in agony as he continued to lock it firmly.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Uhhh...uhhh.&rdquo; Faith moaned helplessly. Her eyes were barely open and her arms thrashed about.</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey has no intention of letting her leg go anytime soon, since he was enjoying this. His grip remained tight on her shin and he was feeling up her leg with his hands. Her ankle was touching his face and he liked how her skin feels against his cheek.</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey tightened his grip on the leg, causing her to moan louder. He has never done this move before...but it&rsquo;s successful, and he wanted to enjoy every bit of it as slowly...and painfully as possible. Faith&rsquo;s leg felt good against his cheek. And he was rubbing his face and nose against her ankle. Her shin and thigh felt soft and warm to his body.</p></p>

<p><p>He licked her ankle and shin with his tongue. *Shherp shherp* He did it in the worst possible way, slobbering his tongue all over her skin, his saliva dripping on her leg.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith continued to moan. &ldquo;Ugh...ugh...&rdquo; The creature&rsquo;s tongue felt disgusting to her, but she was unable to do anything. But him licking her leg was the least of her problems. She was still injured, and her legs, as well as her whole body, was still weak. And now, Spidey was hurting her even more.</p></p>

<p><p>Eventually, he grew bored and proceeded to the next stage of her torture. Still holding her right leg, he reversed his position so that his back is facing her. He lied down, bringing her leg with him. It&rsquo;s like the previous leglock, but in the opposite direction. One can hear the sound of bones cracking as he performed the leglock.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aaaaaaaaah!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Not only was her leg being stretched to its limits, but Spidey was lying on top of her torso, their heads touching, bringing her leg to her shoulder. This caused her immense pain. &ldquo;Uuuuugh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was nothing more but a helpless whelp and all she can do was make noises with her mouth. Spidey showed no mercy whatsoever, he doesn&rsquo;t care if his victim loses a limb or two, he only cares about having fun. And his favorite kind of victims are women...because of the way they scream. Her cries of pain were music to his ears...her screams mean what he&rsquo;s doing is working.</p></p>

<p><p>Still holding her leg, he pulled it twisted it against her hips, causing her to turn over. She was now lying face flat on the ground. He&rsquo;s in a position of complete dominance, so he can do anything he wants to her body.</p></p>

<p><p>He pulled her by the ponytail, yanking her head up. He put her in a headlock, wrapping his arm around her neck. While in a headlock, Spidey pulled up her torso through her head, forcing her to kneel on the ground. The poor girl felt the pain of her neck being crushed, and at the same time, having difficulty breathing. She thought she&rsquo;d pass out any second now.</p></p>

<p><p>Her hands pried his hand off, but to no avail, for she was too weak. Her hands were nothing more than decorations, having no strength to do anything.</p></p>

<p><p>She was still injured from her previous encounter with the Assassin Squad, as well as Blue&rsquo;s torture. She somehow survived all that, but barely. The poor girl has been through a lot of physical torture already...and didn&rsquo;t even have time to recover. But even worse than that, is getting more injuries on top of her injuries. She was too weak and feeble to offer any resistance...and now she&rsquo;s getting tortured all over again. Her tired body could not handle any more punishment...but now she has to face even more punishment, possibly even worse than what she faced before.</p></p>

<p><p>Next, Spidey performed a surfboard on her. The poor woman was semi-conscious and barely moving, so it was easy for him. He placed one foot just above each of her knees and bend her legs up, hooking them around his knees. He grabbed both her wrists and he rolled backwards, so he was lying face up, while compressing her shoulder blades and lifting her off the ground. He was lifting her body upwards, while his hands held her wrists, bending her shoulder blades, and his legs twisting her legs.</p></p>

<p><p>No words can describe her pain, it&rsquo;s the most excruciating one out of all the moves he&rsquo;s done so far. She screamed in agony. &ldquo;Uuuughhh!! Ahhhhh...&rdquo; Her eyes were shut, and her mouth was open, she moaning and groaning the whole time. She couldn&rsquo;t even fall unconscious, the pain was keeping her awake.</p></p>

<p><p>Her fragile limbs felt like they were being torn apart, her wrists being stretched by Spidey&rsquo;s grip. Spidey&rsquo;s legs forced her legs to open more, slowly but surely. Faith moaned and groaned. Her legs were sweating and her arms as well. Sweat was dripping on her breasts and her face. Being naked was the least of her problems now. She felt like her body might be torn into pieces at any time. She&rsquo;s never felt this kind of pain before in her life.</p></p>

<p><p>He grabbed both her legs and put them on his shoulders. He and jumped up and was spinning fast in the air. *Whoosh* Then he landed, slamming her back on the ground. *Wh-Wh-Wham!!!* Faith screamed in pain as her head and back hit the ground. This knocked the wind out of her.</p></p>

<p><p>At this point, she was not even a threat anymore, not that she was one to begin with. But now, she was barely conscious and can&rsquo;t even move, and she&rsquo;s pretty much a lamb for the slaughter.</p></p>

<p><p>As he sat on top of her waist, Spidey stared at her breasts without blinking. &ldquo;Now, it&rsquo;s time to feast! Hehehe!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He dunked his face into her breasts. She moaned and groaned while her fingers grabbed the dirt. Her head tossed and turned.</p></p>

<p><p>Poor Faith can&rsquo;t even catch a break. This was never a fair situation to begin with. This creature came out of no where, and caught her off guard. And she&rsquo;s lying down, and he&rsquo;s on top of her, doing all kinds of perverted things to her defenseless body.</p></p>

<p><p>She wasn&rsquo;t even given a chance to fight back. From the moment she tripped and fell, it was all over. But how can it end just like that...it can&rsquo;t just end this way.</p></p>

<p><p>She grabbed a handful of dirt and threw it in Spidey&rsquo;s eye. He screamed. With this chance, she crawled back, getting her legs free from under him. Then</p></p>

<p><p>she kicked him down. *Wham*</p></p>

<p><p>She quickly crawled towards the mountain wall. Spidey was still screaming and getting the dirt out of his eyes. This was her only chance to escape, so she crawled desperately. Slowly but surely, she reached the mountain wall and used it as a crutch to stand up. Even though she was tired and hurt, she still managed to get up on her feet, using every ounce of strength she had left. She tried to stand up, but her right leg hurt, so she fell on one knee. &ldquo;Ugh...uhhh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey rubbed his eyes and he could see again, although his vision was blurry. &ldquo;Ugh...you bitch.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith, using the wall as support, finally stood up on her feet.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll pay for that...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> Faith stood there like a deer in headlights, leaning against the wall, her hands clasped over her breasts. Now she was trapped with no where to run.</p></p>

<p><p>His vision was finally restored. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon here my little lamb!!&rdquo; He leaped at her. Faith shrieked and kicked him in the stomach. *Thud* His eyes nearly popped out, and he fell on his back.</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey rolled on his front side and rubbed his chin. &ldquo;So you wanna play rough, eh?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Being a hunchback, Spidey walked towards her in a hunchback way, half crawling and half walking.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon baby, let me feel that luscious skin of yours!!&rdquo; said Spidey. &ldquo;Here I come!&rdquo; He charged at her.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith lifted her leg to kick him, but he dodged to the side and grabbed her leg with his hands. This got her by surprise.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Got you!!&rdquo; He put his head into her breasts and snuggled them.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith screamed. &ldquo;Aaaah!!&rdquo; She shoved his face away, causing him to fall down. *Wham*</p></p>

<p><p>Even though he got hit, Spidey was enjoying this very much. He wiped the spit off his mouth and bounced up again.</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey stuck out his wrists and shot a sticky substance and trapped her arms. *Schtick schtick*</p></p>

<p><p>Faith can&rsquo;t move her arms no matter how hard she tried. It was not ordinary spider&rsquo;s web, it is much stronger than that, it felt like permanent glue.</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey advanced, his goggles extended as he leered at her breasts. He laughed in a perverted way. &ldquo;Heh heh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...please! No!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>His hand reached for her and she screamed for her life.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson and Indigo circled each other and hit a few times before backing away. Usually, the first few strikes are used to determine an enemy&rsquo;s strength and attack patterns. But Tyson has no time for that, he intends to end the fight immediately and save Faith.</p></p>

<p><p>He gathered energy into his palm and fired the Energy Blast. Indigo formed a sphere of energy and blocked the Energy Blast. Indigo smirked. He gathered energy into his palm, much like Tyson did.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson&rsquo;s eyes widened. &ldquo;No way...it can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hyah!&rdquo; Indigo fired the Energy Blast.</p></p>

<p><p>There was no time to be surprised, Tyson formed the Electro-shield and saved himself. *Bam*</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You just used my move!&rdquo; Tyson exclaimed. &ldquo;Where did you learn it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;From you...just now.&rdquo;<br>  &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Everyone in the Assassin Squad has unique abilities that cannot be found anywhere else in the universe - you can say we are a rare breed. My ability is to copy other&rsquo;s abilities, techniques, and special moves. Once I see a move, I can copy it and use it over and over...with no limitations.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s...unbelievable!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;And by using your shield, you have just shown me another move that I copied.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re bluffing!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Care to give it a try?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson grunted and flies forward and punched, Indigo formed the Electro-shield, which blocked Tyson&rsquo;s fist. *Wham* Tyson screamed from the pain on his fist.</p></p>

<p><p>Indigo laughed like a villain who already has everything. &ldquo;Ha ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Things are not looking good for our hero. He is already tired from the previous battles, and he has an injured hand, and to top that off, he faces an opponent who can copy everything he does.</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;AS2_TrappedBySpidey&quot;></a>Trapped by Spidey</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey was up close and he leered at Faith&rsquo;s breasts. &ldquo;Finally, I get to feel those mammoths with my hands, hehe!&rdquo; His goggles popped out.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, stop! Please!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon here my babies!&rdquo; Spidey grabbed them with both hands and squeezed them. Faith moaned.</p></p>

<p><p>He put his face between them and snuggled them. They were so soft yet firm, and they felt good to his face. Spidey&rsquo;s excitement is like a kid who just found a new toy to play with. &ldquo;Oh yeah...that&rsquo;s it! They&rsquo;re so big and soft...and bouncy.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith turned her head to the side and screamed. &ldquo;Ugh...uhhh!! Stop, please! Please! Ugh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey continued to snuggled her breasts while letting out grunts of pleasure. &ldquo;Mmmmm yeah. Hehehe. This must be heaven.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please. Stop!&rdquo; Faith blushed as she continued to moan and groan in pain. She struggled to move her arm, but the web was too strong. No matter how hard she pulled, it won&rsquo;t break.</p></p>

<p><p>When Spidey grew bored of playing with her breasts, he thought of playing with something else. &ldquo;I wonder...what&rsquo;s down here? Hmmm...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He put his hand on her thigh and moved up a little bit.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No!!&rdquo; Faith yelled. &ldquo;Stop! Please!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey&rsquo;s hand moved up her thigh, and his filthy mechanical fingers moved closer to her womanhood. It was bad enough that Faith&rsquo;s breasts were groped by this filthy creature, but now his fingers are going to violate her in the worst way imaginable. The mere thought of those sticky, disgusting fingers touching her repulsed her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Noooo!!&rdquo; She instinctively raised her leg and her knee hit him in the chin, knocking him on his back. *Wham*</p></p>

<p><p>After regaining his composure, Spidey bounced back up on his feet. &ldquo;That was a good one, bitch. I think somebody&rsquo;s a little shy, hehehe.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, stay away!&rdquo; Faith pulled her wrists desperately, but the web would not come off.</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey approached her slowly and cautiously, still with that stupid grin on his face. In this situation, it is like a spider and its prey, caught in its trap. The woman can&rsquo;t escape, so he can take his time and enjoy this slowly.</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey leaped at her, causing Faith to scream, and she raised her leg to kick. Spidey grabbed her leg with his arms. &ldquo;Not this time, hehehe! I don&rsquo;t fall for the same trick twice!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let go!&rdquo; she cried out.</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey licked her ankle and her shin with his wet, slimy tongue. Faith groaned in disgust. &ldquo;Ugh!! Stop! Ugh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He continued his assault, licking her knee, and her thigh, waving his tongue back and forth as if licking a lollipop.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now...let&rsquo;s continue where we left off...shall we?&rdquo; Spidey shoved his hand into the towel, causing her to squirm.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh!! Uhhhh aaaah!&rdquo; she screamed.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s head tossed left and right, and her whole body was squirming from the discomfort. She pulled her arms harder than ever.</p></p>

<p><p>The creature laughed as he violated her, causing her to squirm uncontrollably and scream out loud.</p></p>

<p><p>Finally, some of the sticky web came off, and her left arm was free. She shoved his head away and they struggled. Her right arm came free and she shoved him to the floor.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith stepped away and ripped the sticky substance off her wrists. Spidey sprang back up like some martial artist.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You broke through my web? How impressive. Looks like I&rsquo;m gonna hav&rsquo;ta play rough with ya.&rdquo; Then he broke into hysterical laughter. &ldquo;Ha ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He rushed at her, and Faith threw a punch. *Whoosh* Spidey ducked and grabbed her breasts with both hands. For a second, she just looked at him in shock, while Spidey grinned perversely. She screamed and shoved his hands away and stepped back, covering her breasts with both arms.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hehehe. You&rsquo;ve got huge knockers on your chest!&rdquo; said Spidey, making grabbing gestures. &ldquo;Now let me have another feel.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>When looking at her opponent, Faith suddenly grew angry instead of scared. Spidey is probably not even human, it is uncertain what he is. He may be smaller than average, but he is more perverse and creepy than other Assassin Squad members. Not only he is a dirty creature, but he fights dirty as well. With those goggles, the long nose, the long chin, and his wet, slimy tongue, he&rsquo;s nothing short of grotesque.</p></p>

<p><p>And this is the creature that groped her breasts and did all those dirty things to her. Faith grew more and more annoyed, and she let her arms drop to the side, and her fingers clenched into a fist.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So...everyone in the Assassin Squad is like you?&rdquo; Her fists clenched harder. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll...you&rsquo;ll pay for this you creep!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith charged forward and let out a fury of fists. Spidey dodged them all. *Whoosh whoosh*</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha! In the Assassin Squad I am the fastest and most versatile one!&rdquo; he bragged, while dodging left and right.</p></p>

<p><p>His shortness gives him an advantage at speed and flexibility. Her anger and her fists don&rsquo;t phase him at all.</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey then jumped away to a safe distance. Faith ran at him and drew her fist back, Spidey shot a web at her right wrist.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh heh, Little Spidey&rsquo;s got you! What&rsquo;re you going to do now?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith seemed unfazed and surprisingly calm about this. Spidey kept pulling the string little by little, forcing Faith to move closer to him. Suddenly, she jumped up and did a flying kick straight to his face. *Whack* The strike was effective due to Spidey&rsquo;s small stature and the force of the kick, he was knocked down.</p></p>

<p><p>She grabbed the web and ripped it off her hand angrily. Spidey bounced up and landed on his feet. &ldquo;Why you little...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith got into fighting pose. Spidey charged at her, and she punched, he blurred. Faith was shocked and froze for a moment. She glanced left and right, but there was no sign of her enemy.</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey was clinging onto the wall on all fours, exactly like a spider would, and he was snickering to himself. He observed his victim for a moment, who was desperate and confused. She looked left and right and straight ahead but saw no signs of the enemy.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, he leapt at her and grabbed her from behind. Faith gasped.</p></p>

<p><p>His legs were wrapped around hers, while his arms wrapped her chest. &ldquo;I told you I&rsquo;m fast!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>In this position, Faith couldn&rsquo;t move her arms and struggled in vain. This is a bad situation to be in, maybe as bad as when she was trapped against the wall. No, this is definitely worst than that.</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey squeezed her breasts with his fingers, causing her to scream. &ldquo;Uhhh ahhh uhhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>This was very uncomfortable in many ways. He was latched onto her back, and even though he&rsquo;s smaller than average, he still feels heavy. And to top it off, his hands were violating her breasts, his nose was smelling her hair, and he was laughing into her ear. And her legs were losing strength.</p></p>

<p><p>Poor Faith has to face one compromising situation after another, with no chance to rest or hope to escape. She was already exhausted and drained from earlier, and so she barely has any strength left.</p></p>

<p><p>But if she was to fall down now, it is all over for her. The creature will win and do unspeakable things to her. Faith has only one choice. She moved backwards towards the wall. Then she leaped backwards and hit the wall, and Spidey was squished. *Wham*</p></p>

<p><p>They both fell down. Faith was kneeling and panting for breath. Spidey was a little dazed. This chance must not be wasted. She got on her feet and ran away.</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey shot a web at her leg and he tugged it. Faith fell down face forward. *Wham*</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so...&rdquo; He pulled and pulled, making her closer.</p></p>

<p><p>Now that he has her leg, she can&rsquo;t stand up. Spidey laughed and leaped onto her body, landing his face between her legs. He was able to look into the towel, and his goggles extended all the way. &ldquo;Ohhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was embarrassed and screamed. One hand clasped the towel between her legs and the other pushed his face away.</p></p>

<p><p>Then Spidey put his face between her breasts. Faith moaned and groaned. She shoved his chin away as he tried to touch her breast. She bent her knee and kicked his chest, causing him to roll to the side. Faith crawled backwards, with the web still on her leg.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon here, my little lamb!&rdquo; Spidey leapt at her, she rolled away, and he hit the ground.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith crawled backwards as Spidey crawled towards her. He pulled the web on her leg, as her fingers grabbed the dirt. Once close enough, he grabbed her leg. &ldquo;Hehehe.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She kicked him with both legs and hit him in the chin, causing him to tumble back. Faith stood up and ripped the web off her ankle.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson put his palms together and fired three beams at Indigo, who knocked them away like flies.</p></p>

<p><p>Then he said: &ldquo;Let me show you a little move I copied from someone else. Before you, I&rsquo;ve fought many warriors, and some of them had some good moves.&rdquo; Indigo then groaned and screamed in pain as his body became charged with lightning.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson covered his eyes and winced from the brightness. He was in disbelief as his enemy has become a lightning rod, yet his body is somehow in one piece. He charged forward and dived his fist into Indigo&rsquo;s chest. But Indigo was not hurt or affected in the least.</p></p>

<p><p>Then he put his palm on Tyson&rsquo;s chest and zapped him. *Zzzzzt* Tyson was pushed back, his chest struck by a thunder bolt. His body was in bad shape from fighting Blue. To take a direct hit like that was all he could handle, and he fell down as smoke came out of his clothes. *Wham* When he hit the ground, he produced a cloud of dust and smoke, and a hole that is the shape of his body.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith ran towards the trees, hoping to escape this dire situation. But in front of her was a giant spider&rsquo;s web glued between two big trees. She suddenly stopped running and gasped.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hahaha! There&rsquo;s no escape...you&rsquo;re caught in the spider&rsquo;s web.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith turned around and saw Spidey. There was no where to run. Her path was blocked off...and the enemy stands before her. Spidey was really horny by now, as one can tell from his facial expressions. &ldquo;Heh heh...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith stepped back, clasping her hand over her breasts. Spidey shot a web at her towel. &ldquo;Got ya!&rdquo; he shouted. He gave it a good tug and yanked it off. *Whoop* The towel flung in the air...and she was standing before him, completely naked.</p></p>

<p><p>His goggles popped out all the way as he stared at her naked form. Faith screamed and covered herself, and fell to her knees. One hand covered her breasts, and the other hand covered her vagina. He only saw her naked body for a few short seconds, but he was still in shock, even after she fell down. He pushed his goggles back in and regained his composure.</p></p>

<p><p>For Faith, this is the worst case scenario...she was kneeling down, naked and embarrassed. She can no longer fight back and dreaded what horrors await her. Faith&rsquo;s eyes were shaking, her body trembling, and she was gasping for air, fearful of what is going to happen next. She was kneeling before this pervert, naked and defenseless.</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey had a wicked grin on his face, a grin that says victory belongs to him. &ldquo;Now come here, my little kitten!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey shot a web at her neck, causing her to gasp. He pulled the web forward, yanking Faith&rsquo;s body into the dirt. &ldquo;Oof!!&rdquo; Faith&rsquo;s hands instinctively grabbed the webbing on her neck.</p></p>

<p><p>He pulled the webbing, dragging her body towards him, scraping the dirt on the ground. The poor girl has to suffer even more physical punishment...the web around her neck was tight and it hurt. Her delicate, naked body was scraping the ground. But this was nothing compared to what&rsquo;s going to come next.</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey dragged her until she was near his feet. He let out a triumphant grin. Then he started laughing hysterically and doing cartwheels around her. &ldquo;Hahahahah! I got you now! You&rsquo;re all mine!&rdquo; He was jumping up and down like a kid in a candy store. &ldquo;Victory belongs to me! I am the strongest fighter!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He proceeded to kick her in the stomach. *Thud* The sound of his foot hitting her flesh was clearly audible, as he used full force. She groaned from the impact. &ldquo;That punch from before hurt a lot, bitch. Now I&rsquo;m going to make you pay tenfold!&rdquo; He continued to kick her in the stomach. She moaned from each kick. &ldquo;Ugh! &ldquo;Ugh! Ugh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey showed no mercy, despite her being naked and unable to defend herself. She was rendered immobile from the pain and unable to do a thing. Faith&rsquo;s fingers grabbed the dirt in front of her and squeezed it tightly as she suffered through Spidey&rsquo;s torture. He then kicked her in the chest. Faith groaned from every kick...&ldquo;Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Poor Faith was all bruised and battered even before she ever ran into Spidey. Her entire body was injured during the fight with the assassins...and without even a chance to rest, she was taken to Blue&rsquo;s ship and violated even more. They stripped her naked, damaged her body, violated her sexually, humiliated her completely. And now, she&rsquo;s separated from Tyson, and facing even more torture from this creature...physically and sexually.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Teal&rsquo;s used his telekinesis to slam her body into the ground hard...several times. In the process, a few of her ribs were broken, and it was extremely painful for her. They were still broken, and Spidey was kicking her injured chest, adding more pain on top of it. Any woman who got kicked like this would be in a world of pain. But to get kicked in the chest while injured makes the pain ten times worse...no, even one hundred times worse. Right now, she&rsquo;s nothing more than a piece of meat...her feelings, her pain and her suffering mean nothing to this freak. He kept kicking and laughing without holding back one bit.</p></p>

<p><p>When he got tired of kicking her chest, he stomped on her butt. &ldquo;Ugh! Ugh!&rdquo; He stomped on it over and over, as if trying to flatten her butt. It was soft and bouncy, and he liked how it felt against his feet. He did not slow down at all, stomping at the same rate was kicking her. Her fingers couldn&rsquo;t grab the dirt anymore...her whole body convulsed each time he jumped on her.</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey became more turned on as he caused her more pain...for some reason, physically abusing a naked woman made him feel powerful, and he was on a rush. Faith&rsquo;s moans sounded sexual and it turned him on...it made him want to hurt her even more.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;P-Please stop...&rdquo; she cried out. &ldquo;P-Please...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> He moved on to stomping her left thigh. *Thud* Her legs were soft and fragile, and he was treating them like pieces of meat. It was painful and uncomfortable for her. Aqua also stomped on her leg at the same spot, as well as hitting her legs with rock, and Navy shot several lasers on her leg. Spidey did not know and did not care. He was adding injury on top of injury, stomping on it with full force.</p></p>

<p><p>Soon, he got bored of stomping her leg. He hopped on her butt with both feet, causing her moan. &ldquo;Ugh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> Spidey began to jump on her lower back. Each time he landed on her spine, her body convulsed and her limbs trembled...and she couldn&rsquo;t even grab the dirt anymore. Just when she thought it couldn&rsquo;t get any worse...this is worst torture he&rsquo;s done on her yet. She screamed even louder before. &ldquo;Aaah! Aaah! Aaah!&rdquo; He stomped her harder and harder, allowing gravity to do its part.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s back was still injured from Teal&rsquo;s telekinesis. And Aqua damaged her body pretty badly. Not to mention all the stuff that Blue did to her body in the dark room. But right now, what happened in the past doesn&rsquo;t matter. What matters is the damage from her body remains...Her body had no time to heal and still has to face more abuse.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s situation has taken a turn for the worst...her body and her fate now belong to someone else. Her towel was gone, as well as her dignity...and any chance of escape. Not only can she not fight back, but she was lying face down on the ground, unable to see anything but the dirt in front of her, and she was completely naked and exposed to this deviant. Her only hope was that she can survive his torture...in one piece. But seeing her body&rsquo;s condition, she might not last long.</p></p>

<p><p>Eventually, Spidey grew tired of jumping on her, giving her a small chance to rest and breathe...before he does something else.</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey pretended that he was in the middle of a wrestling arena, and the audience was cheering for him. He was basking in the spot light. Facing the audience, he raised his arms in the air triumphantly. He then turned to the fallen woman, preparing his next move.</p></p>

<p><p> After all the beatings, Faith was barely conscious. Her eyes were half shut and she was breathing through her mouth.</p></p>

<p><p>He fell forward, with his elbow facing down, and landed his elbow on her back. *Wham* Faith&rsquo;s entire body reacted to the devastating blow...her head sprang upwards and her eyes opened wide in shock. She screamed in agony. &ldquo;Aaaaaagh!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He stepped on her behind as if it&rsquo;s a stool, causing her to moan slightly. &ldquo;Ugh...&rdquo; The audience cheered louder as he did that. He raised his arms to the air in triumph. &ldquo;Yeeaaaahhh!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey then did a full mount on top of her back, as if she&rsquo;s a horse. He grabbed her left arm and twisted it against her back. She groaned in pain. &ldquo;Ah ha ha ha ha! What&rsquo;s the matter? Not so tough now huh?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He was really enjoying the act of pinning her down. Spidey&rsquo;s been physically weak his whole life, and he&rsquo;s always been taking orders from those stronger than him, like Azure. Often, his subordinates would pick on him and call him names. His dream is to be strong and dominate others. Today is his lucky day, since he gets to dominate and sexually abuse this helpless, naked woman all he wants. Ever since Spidey saw her face on the computer screen, he wanted to do all kinds of things to her body. And now, that little sick dream of his has become a reality. And they are in the middle of nowhere, and no one is going to interfere...so he can take his time and enjoy himself.</p></p>

<p><p>After he had enough, Spidey switched arms. He grabbed her right arm and twisted it on her back, while his other hand pinned down her head. She groaned the whole time.</p></p>

<p><p>He was ordered to keep her alive, but he did not care if he breaks a bone or two...or a dozen. He just wants to enjoy himself to the fullest. As a scientist, he always wanted to experiment on a human female and see what their anatomy was like. And what good luck he has to happen to find a woman clad in nothing but a towel...it saves him the trouble of stripping her naked. It must be his lucky day to kill two birds in one stone - he gets to see what a naked female looks like, and he gets to perform wrestling moves on her...and of course, sexually abuse her all he wants.</p></p>

<p><p>When Spidey grew bored, he finally let go of her. Faith had only a few seconds of rest before he did something else. She was just like a sheep waiting to be stripped of its cotton.</p></p>

<p><p>He was kneeling on her waist as she laid face down on the dirt. Spidey grabbed one of her legs and bent it backwards, pulling it towards his shoulder.</p></p>

<p><p>This is called the scorpion, another wrestler&rsquo;s move that he learned from TV.</p></p>

<p><p>It caused her great pain...and she groaned and moaned while her fingers grabbed the dirt. Spidey was bending her leg backwards while sitting on her butt, causing a lot of stress on her spine.</p></p>

<p><p>In Spidey&rsquo;s mind, he was still in the arena and the audience cheered him on. He twisted the poor woman&rsquo;s leg even harder. It was a physically demanding move on his part, but he was enjoyed torturing this woman so he used his full strength, bending her leg to its limits. Her ankle was touching his face, and he liked the way her skin felt.</p></p>

<p><p>Ever since he saw this move on TV, he&rsquo;s always wanted to try it on someone. But he has no sparring partner so he wanted to try it on one of his victims.</p></p>

<p><p>After what felt like an eternity, Spidey was finally done with the scorpion move. Again, she had only a few seconds of relief before something else happens. He grabbed her by the ponytail and yanked her up and down like a puppet. This caused her neck slight discomfort. But in her body&rsquo;s condition, everything done to her was painful. She couldn&rsquo;t move a muscle...in the literal sense. She didn&rsquo;t even have energy to twitch her fingers. All she could do was breath and blink and make noises with her mouth.</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey smooshed her face into the dirt and laughed at her. Faith couldn&rsquo;t see a thing, and her nose and mouth were buried in the dirt. &ldquo;Mmmffff...Mfff....&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson laid on the dirt, exhausted and unable to move. He was topless, wearing only blue pants. Bruises appeared on his torso and limbs. After being struck by Indigo&rsquo;s thunderbolt, he was too injured to fight back or even move. He coughed from the pain on his chest.</p></p>

<p><p>Indigo landed on the ground next to the fallen sayan. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one who defeated Commander Blue? How...disappointing.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You...just wait till I fight you at full power...then you&rsquo;ll be sorry.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I am sorry indeed, that I did not get to see your super sayan transformation. But there&rsquo;s no hurry. I got what I came for.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson&rsquo;s head lifted slightly. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That woman who was with you, Spidey has captured her by now.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You...don&rsquo;t you even think about hurting her!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Indigo laughed. &ldquo;Ha ha. Do you think you&rsquo;re in a condition to threaten me? If you want your woman back, then come find me...and then you can show me your true power.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>With that said, Indigo flew to the sky. An invisible spaceship became visible, and opened up its hatch, allowing Indigo to fly inside. The hatch closed, and the spaceship became camouflaged with the sky&rsquo;s colors and flew off.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...Faith...&rdquo; Tyson moaned as his hand reached for the sky.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aaaaah!!&rdquo; Faith screamed as she was being tortured. Spidey was sitting on her butt, pulling her arms, causing her torso to bend backwards. This caused a lot of tension and strain on her shoulders, and her torso, as well her spine. She was in excruciating pain...and didn&rsquo;t even have the strength to keep her eyes open. She moaned with one eye open. &ldquo;Uuuuuuh!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey showed no mercy to her whatsoever...he enjoyed her cries of helplessness...it made him want to hurt her even more. Not caring that she&rsquo;s just a helpless woman with a frail body, he pulled her wrists with all his might...trying to snap her arms off her shoulders.</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey prefers to torture females, it turns him on like no other hobby. He likes the way they scream, moan, and the way they beg and plead. He also likes how their skin tastes. He likes everything about them. He would&rsquo;ve been satisfied torturing any unlucky female at all. But this one happens to be extra voluptuous, and already naked...what a bonus for him.</p></p>

<p><p>When Spidey&rsquo;s arms got tired, he let go of her arms, and her face hit the dirt, and she breathed into the dirt. She only got a few seconds break before he does something else to her.</p></p>

<p><p>He grabbed her hair and yanked her head up a little bit. He laughed and snickered at her as he played with her.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, a man dressed like a ninja came out of no where, gliding on an ice path that came out of his palm. *Scrrrrrrrr*</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey sensed danger, and he turned around, and saw the ninja warrior. The warrior stuck his palm out and shot a beam of ice, and Spidey, using his quick reflexes, jumped away to avoid it. *Froom*</p></p>

<p><p>Faith, however, was not so fortunate. She was laying face down and unable to dodge it. The ice beam hit her legs and her waist. She groaned in pain.</p></p>

<p><p>Icicles appeared on her hamstrings, her butt, and her lower back.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this, <strong>Azure</strong>?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Azure is a mysterious assassin who works in the Assassin Squad, and like Spidey, he does not report to Commander Blue, but directly to Indigo. Unlike the other members, he does not wear the full body suit, but rather, loosely fitted ninja clothes. He wore a mask that covers his nose and mouth, but his eyes can be seen, and they are of a deep ocean blue color. Probably the most unique thing about him is that his hair is light blue.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I can ask you the same thing. You were instructed to capture the target, not play around with her.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do what I want as long as I follow my orders. It has nothing to do with you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You are taking too long.&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;You even had time to strip her.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t wearing anything to begin with. What&rsquo;s wrong with having a little fun before she becomes a subject? She might not survive the experiments.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Playtime is over. We are to get back to the ship now.&rdquo; Azure walked over to fallen woman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll immobilize the target.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith crawled away desperately, wanting to escape this place. But she was too injured and tired and unable to move very far.</p></p>

<p><p>Azure faced the fallen woman, and opened his palm, releasing cold air like a spray can. The air hit her calves first, then moved its way up her legs. He was going to freeze her starting from the bottom.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith groaned painfully as the ice penetrated her skin. It&rsquo;s just like being hit with liquid nitrogen...her skin became frozen within a matter of seconds.</p></p>

<p><p>Once done with her legs, he moved the spray up to her waist and lower back.</p></p>

<p><p>Still trying to crawl, her hands grabbed the dirt and pulled with all her might, but it was no use. Her lower body was frozen and she could not move any longer. Even before this, her crawling only allowed her to move a miniscule distance, not enough to escape this horrible situation. But now, she could not even move an inch further, and all efforts were in vain.</p></p>

<p><p>The pain of being frozen alive was unbearable...her body felt like it was being pierced by a thousand needles...all pricking her skin at once.</p></p>

<p><p>Azure slowly moved the spray up to her back and her shoulders. For him, freezing people is a hobby, and he has no regard for their well being whatsoever. Living in subzero temperatures all his life, he does not know what it means to be cold.</p></p>

<p><p>But for Faith, this is the coldest moment she has ever felt in her entire life. She remembered one particular winter night, when she was so cold she could see her breathe. The temperature was subzero and merciless...she was tucked under a blanket, sitting next to a fireplace, and she was still shivering.</p></p>

<p><p>There was another time where she was walking through a blizzard. Even wearing a scarf and gloves, she was still shivering. The snow was getting into her eyes, and she had to cover her face while dragging her feet through piles of snow. That by far was the coldest memory she had...</p></p>

<p><p>But that cold was nothing compared to this...this made those cold nights seem warm. This by contrast is a thousand times colder than the coldest thing she&rsquo;s ever felt. Back then she was at least wearing clothes...but right now she was butt naked. Not knowing who or what is doing this to her...she was about to become a naked human statue.</p></p>

<p><p>Poor Faith was completely immobile...and it&rsquo;s only going to get worse from here on. The ice spray moved its way up her back and to her shoulders...and shortly afterward, her shoulders became frozen. Then slowly but surely, her upper arms became frozen. Her right arm lost 90% of its mobility and all she could do was reach for the air. Her shivering arm desperately reached forward and her fingers opened, hoping to grab something. Even moving her fingers became difficult as she lost more and more of what&rsquo;s left of her right arm.</p></p>

<p><p>Tears drip down her eyes as she faced immense physical pain...as well as psychological pain. Too many things have happened to her in such a short time...and there&rsquo;s no time to even process what she&rsquo;s been through. Ever since she was kidnapped by the Assassin Squad, she never had a moment of peace...she was violated and tortured non-stop. Unlike the other heroes, she does not know anything about them...all she knows is that they are all bad people who want to hurt her and do terrible things to her.</p></p>

<p><p>It seems like time and time again she gets caught off guard, without a chance to defend herself, getting thrown from one unfair situation to the next. And once again, she was caught naked, with absolutely nothing to cover up her body. Spidey&rsquo;s torture was cruel, but it was nothing compared to this. But right now, she truly has no idea what&rsquo;s going on...except the unbearable agony of being frozen alive.</p></p>

<p><p>Her fingers became frozen, and they no longer responded. Her hand dropped to the ground. She felt agonizing pain throughout her entire body at once. It&rsquo;s as if someone dropped a block of ice on her naked body. But it&rsquo;s worse than that...her body itself became the ice. As she twitched her fingers one last time, the tears continued to drip down her face.</p></p>

<p><p>For Azure, this is nothing but a walk in the park. He has frozen and murdered countless people his whole life, and now he&rsquo;s going to freeze one more person. Freezing a helpless naked woman is a lot easier than a live moving target, but he enjoys it nonetheless. For him, this may but a brief moment of enjoyment, and he has no idea what kind of suffering his victim is going through. Faith&rsquo;s suffering was 1,000 times more intense than any pain he could ever feel in his life.</p></p>

<p><p>Her arms no longer able to move, all she had left were her fingers...and they were losing feeling...and eventually they stopped moving completely. She was so cold that she&rsquo;s forgotten what warmth is. Only moments ago, she and Tyson were making love on the grass. She was naked and he was on top of her, and they felt the warmth of each other&rsquo;s bodies. His face was between her breasts, his lips kissing her skin, and his legs were between hers. Her fingers grabbed the grass and squeezed it tightly.</p></p>

<p><p>But now...it&rsquo;s all over...that warmth and love is now nothing more than a sweet memory...a memory she did not have time to cherish.</p></p>

<p><p>The tears keep dripping. These are not just tears of suffering, but of sadness, and helplessness. She was like a lamb for the slaughter.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith couldn&rsquo;t even see who was doing this. None of this makes any sense. Why is this happening only to her? What did she do to deserve this punishment?</p></p>

<p><p>All she wants to do is go home...yet here she is facing an indescribable pain and humiliation. It&rsquo;s a fate worst than death...</p></p>

<p><p>Eventually, the ice reached her neck and crawled its way up to her chin. She shed on more tear drop and it became a drop of ice on her face. And slowly but surely, her face became frozen, little by little...and she knew it was almost over. Her body became numb and so did her face...and soon she felt nothing. All the sadness and suffering was gone, replaced by nothingness...and emptiness...</p></p>

<p><p>Still lying in dirt, Tyson started feeling sorry for himself. Here he was, wearing only pants and nothing else, sleeping in a hole that he fell into. He was defeated and physically injured. And on top of that, he lost Faith. He can&rsquo;t even protect one woman.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Faith...no...&rdquo; he cried out.</p></p>

<p><p>But he was too tired to even feel angry or any emotions at all. His eyes felt heavy, and his head was hurting more, and the only thing his body wanted was to sleep. He figured once he wakes up he&rsquo;ll feel better, and he fell unconscious right then and there.</p></p>


<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="c">[ C ] - The De-Briefing </span></p></center>


<p><p>When he opened his eyes, Tyson saw a ceiling with bright lights. He covered his eyes and sat up. &ldquo;Ugh...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You woke up at last.&rdquo; said Nebula. &ldquo;You took a pretty bad hit there.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Bad hit?&rdquo; Tyson looked down and saw bandages on his chest. Suddenly, his body was in pain. &ldquo;Ugh...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;To be able to do that to you...&rdquo; said Mac. &ldquo;Who could&rsquo;ve done such a thing?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know...but there&rsquo;s more members in the Assassin Squad.&rdquo; Tyke replied.</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire crossed his arms in distress. &ldquo;If only Faith was here, she can heal you instantly.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson became depressed. &ldquo;Faith...they took her. I couldn&rsquo;t protect her.&rdquo; He was sitting there on the table, staring at the floor, his arms resting on his laps. He was not just physically injured, but injured on the inside as well.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula became annoyed at Tyke&rsquo;s self-deprecation. &ldquo;This is not the time to blame yourself.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But it was my fault...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Argh! If you have time to feel sorry for yourself, then get stronger!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Guys, this is not the time for a sibling fight.&rdquo; said Zelfire.</p></p>

<p><p>Mac&rsquo;s computer beeped and Angela&rsquo;s face appeared. &ldquo;Everyone.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Everybody turned their attention to the computer. &ldquo;Miss Angela?&rdquo; said Mac. &ldquo;What brings you here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Angela: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve successfully locked Commander Blue in our space fortress. He will be tried by the Galactic Police for his crimes. Unfortunately, this is not the end of it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;I thought Blue was the last of them?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Angela: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s more. The original members of the squad were Teal, Aqua, and Navy, their unit led by Commander Blue. All of them are either dead or captured, thanks you. But there are more members in the Assassin Squad.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The computer screen showed four quadrants, each one with the profile of one of the members. On the top left quadrant was Teal&rsquo;s face, along with some stats about him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Why weren&rsquo;t we informed of this earlier?&rdquo; Zelfire asked, still crossing his arms.</p></p>

<p><p>Angela: &ldquo;We only received intel recently. The Assassin Squad is a mysterious group of assassins. Even with our intelligence network, we can only dig up so much information on them. They move from planet to planet and they never stay in one spot. Their motives are unclear...and their boss is unknown.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire: &ldquo;What do you know about them?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Angela: &ldquo;All their members have been scouted because of their exceptional abilities. They have abilities that are beyond the boundaries of what we think are possible. For example, they developed cloaking technology that turns them invisible. We can&rsquo;t see them with the naked eye. They can hide their ki and body heat so we can&rsquo;t sense them with our sixth sense. They&rsquo;re like ghosts. Which makes them perfect for assassination missions.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;Wait a minute. If Blue isn&rsquo;t their real leader...does that mean he&rsquo;s just a lackie taking orders...from someone else even stronger?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Angela: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s correct. Their leader is a man named Indigo.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson&rsquo;s eyes grew wide open upon hearing that name. &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s him! He&rsquo;s the one who did this to me!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Angela: &ldquo;Rumor has it that he has the ability to copy other&rsquo;s abilities and techniques.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. He stole some of my moves.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p></p>

<p><p>Angela: &ldquo;Other than that, everything about Indigo is a mystery.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire: &ldquo;A foe like that is very dangerous. We can&rsquo;t take him head on.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;So what if he can copy our moves? That doesn&rsquo;t mean anything. I&rsquo;ll take him on and take him down!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;No I&rsquo;ll handle him. He can&rsquo;t copy sword techniques so naturally I&rsquo;ll be the one for the job.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mac: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you should fight him one on one.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire: &ldquo;Macintosh is right, Nebula. We have to fight him as a team.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have that luxury to fight as a team. You know how they work. They like to attack us by surprise when we&rsquo;re alone. Besides, Tyson is injured. I&rsquo;m the best you&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Angela: &ldquo;I agree, Tyson you should stay out of this one. It&rsquo;s likely Indigo targeted you because he wants to copy your super sayan transformation.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re kidding right?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire: &ldquo;Is that even possible?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mac: &ldquo;His copy ability has too many unknowns...but if he is able to copy a super sayan and become one...then we are all screwed. We can&rsquo;t take that chance.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The atmosphere in the room suddenly became gloomier. Angela continued: &ldquo;In any case, our officers are working around the clock to get more intel on the Assassin Squad. Until then, promise me you won&rsquo;t do anything rash.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;Yeah. We won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>In the middle of the room lay a block of ice, inside of which is Faith&rsquo;s frozen body. It was placed vertically. She was in the same position when she was frozen. Her face was in pain, her arms were raised, her right hand reaching for something.</p></p>

<p><p>A soldier grabbed a flamethrower and unlocked it. He was wearing black visors and black gloves.</p></p>

<p><p>Soldier B tapped him on the shoulder. &ldquo;Your job is to melt the ice. Be careful not to burn her. Spidey instructed us to keep her unharmed.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, yeah. I&rsquo;ll be careful.&rdquo; replied Soldier A. He pulled the trigger, and flames came out of the nozzle.</p></p>

<p><p>He pointed the flames at the ice and it began to melt rapidly. Water dripped from the ice and made a pool that steadily grew larger.</p></p>

<p><p>Most of the ice chunks melted, leaving only the body. Faith fell down on the floor. In her first moments of consciousness, she was already in dire pain. There were icicles all over her body. She was naked and cold, and shivering.</p></p>

<p><p>Soldier A turned off the flamethrower and tossed it on the floor. *Clunk* He took off his visors.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith started to crawl up. She saw soldiers standing there. She got on her knees and covered her privates. She had no idea what&rsquo;s happening. She was naked and helpless, and kneeling before two soldiers in uniform. She was scared and her eyes were shaking.</p></p>

<p><p>Soldier A snickered and giggled. &ldquo;Heh heh. Are you awake, sleeping beauty? Now...what say we get you warmed up, eh?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He approached her. She grew more scared. His hand reached for her, and she screamed.</p></p>

<p><p>Indigo was watching a replay of Blue vs. Tyson. He was watching with much interest. Azure was also in the room.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the legendary super sayan. Interesting.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sir, is it even possible for you to copy that? Not that I&rsquo;m doubting you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t know until we find out. This is the reason why I sent Blue on this mission, to make Spade show his super sayan powers. But that incompetent fool got himself arrested by the Galactic Police.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was now lying on an operating table. There&rsquo;s metal cuffs on her wrists and ankles. And cuffs around her breasts and waist so her privates were at least covered. Spidey pushed a button and the table rotated itself into a vertical position.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What are you going to do to me?&rdquo; she asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh. You&rsquo;ll find out soon enough.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Indigo came into the room.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who are you? What do you want from me?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey: &ldquo;Quiet woman. Indigo will be the one asking the questions.&rdquo;<br>  Indigo: &ldquo;Ah, so you are Tyson Spade&rsquo;s woman, eh? I believe your name is Faith. Forgive me for not formally introducing myself. I am Indigo, the leader of the Assassin Squad.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>That name rang a bell, although she was not exactly sure who it is. But his voice sounded familiar. Suddenly, she gasped in fear after remembering something horrifying. Her eyes widened and she became short of breath. The point of view zoomed into her eyes as she recalls a memory buried deep in her subconscious.</p></p>

<p><p>The woman moaned and groaned in agony. She was naked and bent over the control panel. A man was leaning on top of her, grabbing her breasts and squeezing them hard. She was sweating all over, and so tired that her eyes cannot stay open. She was about to fall unconscious at any time, but the pain was keeping her awake.</p></p>

<p><p>The computer flashed and a silhouetted man&rsquo;s face appeared. &ldquo;Blue, I need to speak with you. Gaaah! What&rsquo;re doing?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind me, Commander Indigo, keep speaking.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Seriously, can&rsquo;t you do that stuff another time?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? I like mixing business with pleasure.&rdquo; He squeezed Faith&rsquo;s right breast extra hard.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I came to tell you that the Galactic Police are on your trail. Be careful.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I see...those pesky cops from the corner of the universe want to slow me down.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Remember Blue, I do not tolerate failure.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t fail you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmph.&rdquo; Indigo&rsquo;s face disappeared.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue then whispered in Faith&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s get back to business shall we?&rdquo; He continued to violate her, and her screams echoed throughout the dark room.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s...it&rsquo;s you...&rdquo; she muttered.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It looks like you remembered something unpleasant. You&rsquo;re probably wondering why you are here. Where are my manners? To put it simply, I know about your healing abilities.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was surprised. &ldquo;How...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t underestimate the Assassin Squad&rsquo;s intel network. I want to know what is your secret? And the answer lies in your body.&rdquo; He ran his finger down her solar plexus and towards her belly button. She gasped. &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t look like the type who will give away your secret.&rdquo; He poked his finger at her belly button. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re going to find out what your little secret is...sooner or later. I&rsquo;ll leave you in the capable hands of Spidey.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey chuckled at the compliment. Indigo waved goodbye and left the room. As soon as the door closed, Faith knew she was doomed. Spidey clasped his hands as he was getting excited. &ldquo;Heh heh. Now, we&rsquo;re all alone. Let&rsquo;s spend some quality time together.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>That does not sound good to her, and she feared for her life. &ldquo;No...no...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey pulled the lever, and the table reclined itself horizontally. Faith was helpless as a sitting duck, unable to do anything with her limbs locked down.</p></p>

<p><p>He put his face directly in front of hers and chuckled. She turned away from him. He licked her face, causing her to wince, shutting her eyes and making noises in disgust. His tongue went from her neck, to the cheek, and almost licked her left eye.</p></p>

<p><p>The hunchback leaned over the table and stared at her stomach like a hungry man would stare at food.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please...no!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He hopped on the table and proceeded to lick her stomach. He had all the time in the world, so he can afford to take it slow. His tongue dipped into her belly button and frolicked around in there, causing her much discomfort. Then he glided his wet, gross tongue up her solar plexus. He licked it all the way once, then twice, and continued until he was satisfied.</p></p>

<p><p>Then he hopped off the table and stared at her leg. He put his tongue on her shin and licked it all way to her knee, and then to her thigh.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith groaned in disgust. &ldquo;Uaaaah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He moved his tongue back and forth on her thigh, licking like it&rsquo;s a lollipop.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Uaaah!! Stop! Please! Uaaaah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey then licked his own fingers. He placed them on her inner thigh, and moved its away between her legs, directly under the metal band. Faith screamed and tossed and turned. &ldquo;Aaaaaaah!&rdquo;</p></p>

</span></p></center>


<p><p>Azure came into the laboratory and walked towards Indigo, whose back was facing him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sir.&rdquo; Azure bowed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ah, Azure. Good timing, I just wanted to show you something.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked. But his question was answered when he saw what was inside one of the glass chambers.</p></p>

<p><p>It was Aqua, or more precisely, a portion of his body. His head was missing a piece, and his torso has a big hole on the side. &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of our former comrades.&rdquo; said Indigo. &ldquo;Or what&rsquo;s left of him. His body was heavily damaged in the fight against Tyson Spade.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You are keeping him alive?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh. Barely. I wouldn&rsquo;t call him alive. That&rsquo;s why we need the woman named Faith. She has regenerative powers in her cells...we need to find the secret to her powers so we can restore Aqua to the way he was.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That woman? She has such a power? Sir, it is too risky to keep her alive.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh? Why&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Indigo.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;As long as she is alive, they will come after us and hunt us down. I know how relentless these earth warriors can be. Just let me make her into an ice statue, so her beauty will be preserved for all eternity.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We need her alive to study her.&rdquo; said Indigo. &ldquo;The Murai Assassin Squad works in the shadows. We recruit fighters from all over the universe, seeking those with extraordinary abilities, like yours. We can become invisible, turn people to ice, generate electricity from our bodies...yet we cannot heal. Imagine the possibilities if our scientist, Spidey can develop a suit that heals our bodies. Imagine what an asset that would be.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Azure&rsquo;s eyes widened. &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;d be practically invincible.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The hunchback crawled upwards and now they&rsquo;re face to face. Faith turned to the side to avoid looking at him. He shot his sticky web at her mouth. Now she can&rsquo;t speak, she can only make mumbling noises. &ldquo;Mmmf...mmfff!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey took out a device that looks like a shiny vibrator. He pointed it at her face, and she winced. He turned it on and it was vibrating. He put it into her belly button to tease her. She moaned and her body twitched.</p></p>

<p><p>He then pointed it between her legs. Faith moaned, pleading him not to do it. &ldquo;Mmmff! Mmmff!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> Spidey stuck the vibrator in there, causing her to squirm and moan louder than before. Even though her mouth was glued, her moans were still loud.</p></p>

<p><p>Her moans of agony were heard throughout the ship. No one but those two knew what happened inside.</p></p>

<p><p>Indigo came back to check on Aqua&rsquo;s progress. His body has regenerated and there was no longer a hole on his head. Indigo was pleased. &ldquo;Soon you&rsquo;re going to come back from the dead. Isn&rsquo;t this what they call a miracle?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Aqua&rsquo;s eyes opened.</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;AS2_TheBurningRage&quot;></a>The Burning Rage</p></p>

<p><p>Two soldiers were assigned to guard the laboratory. They stood by the door for hours and they were bored. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe I got stuck with this crappy job.&rdquo; said Soldier A.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;d you expect?&rdquo; Soldier B replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re nothing more than station guards, we&rsquo;re expendable.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tch. These big shots boss us around just because they are powerful.&rdquo; He stared at the woman inside the glass chamber and he had an idea. &ldquo;Say...how about we have some fun?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;re ya talking about?&rdquo; asked B. A second later he understood what his partner meant. &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t even think about it. We&rsquo;ll get into big trouble! We can lose our heads!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A turned to face B. &ldquo;As long as we put her back inside after we&rsquo;re done, we won&rsquo;t get caught.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But if we do, we&rsquo;re dead!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What are you, a scaredy cat? C&rsquo;mon man. We&rsquo;re stuck here for the whole night. Even useless guys like us need to have a little fun.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well...I guess.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>*Smash* The soldier carelessly cracked a beer bottle on the floor. They were drunk and in a playful mood, and they snickered as they watch their victim cower in fear. Faith, who was clad in a pink towel, was shivering in fear as Soldier A stood in front of her. He finished his last beer and tossed the bottle away and wiped his mouth with his sleeve. &ldquo;Aaah. And now, for the main event...&rdquo; He took a step towards Faith.</p></p>

<p><p>With her hand clinging onto her chest, she backed away until she was against the computer panel. &ldquo;No...no...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Soldier A grabbed her by the arms and smiled wickedly.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please, don&rsquo;t...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He shoved her down on the control panel and she screamed as he put his face in her breasts.</p></p>

<p><p>The observing soldiers hollered and raised their arms in the air, cheering for their comrade. To them, this is a form of entertainment. Being hired goons, they constantly have to obey orders from their superiors and risk their lives at another&rsquo;s command. As lowlifes, they became troops so that they can one day have power and order people around. And naturally, they have no respect for women. To them, women are nothing more than playthings. And now that they have someone to toy around with, they are going to have some fun.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith groaned and shrieked at the discomfort of having a stranger&rsquo;s face stuffed between her breasts, and her body naturally resisted it. Her arms pushed his shoulders away from her, but he grabbed her wrists and secured them by locking them to the side. Even though her towel is in the way, he can feel the softness of her breasts and snuggled them like pillows. Her legs thrashed about and her head tossed and turned as he violated her.</p></p>

<p><p>When Soldier A grew tired of playing with her breasts, he removed his face from them. &ldquo;Now...let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s under here...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He grabbed the loose end of the towel on her breasts and yanked it.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Faith would not let him pull it off, she held onto the towel with her left hand, and grabbed his wrists with her right hand. Soldier A could not yank her towel off, and he shoved her arm on the control panel and grabbed her chin with his free hand.</p></p>

<p><p>He forced his lips on hers. &ldquo;Mmmmfff!!&rdquo; Even though it was only a few seconds, it felt disgusting and unbearable. Then, moving his head south, he kissed her neck, and her breasts and snuggled them. Faith screamed as her head turned the side. &ldquo;Aaah! Uuugh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The other soldiers cheered him on, raising their bottles in the air and screaming like street thugs.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aaaaah!!&rdquo; Faith screamed as she was being tortured. Spidey was sitting on her butt, pulling her arms, causing her torso to bend backwards. This caused a lot of tension and strain on her arms and her torso, and her spine. Her entire body was in pain. She screamed with one eye open. &ldquo;Uuuuuuh!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey then let go of her arms, and face hit the dirt, and she breathed into the dirt. She only got a few seconds break before he does something else to her.</p></p>

<p><p>He pulled her by the hair, lifting her head up. He smelled her ponytail, then shoved her face back into the dirt.</p></p>

<p><p>The soldier snuggled her breasts as if they were pillows, and he even grabbed them with his hands. At this rate, the same thing is going to happen to her...she&rsquo;s going to lose everything again. Faith suddenly gained the strength back in her arms and pushed his face away from her chest. He kept trying to lean into her breasts while she pushed, and she shoved his body to the side, causing him to fall to the floor. *Thud*</p></p>

<p><p>Clinging onto the towel, she stood up and ran towards the door. But Soldier B stood in her way, and she gasped. She turned the other way and ran, but Soldier C stood in the way, with his arms extended sideways. Faith gasped as the two closed in on her.</p></p>

<p><p>She stepped back until she her back bumped into Soldier D. She gasped as he grabbed her breasts from behind. She groaned and squirmed as he squeezed them as he liked. Her arms were trapped under his and he stroked them. The other men just watched with envious faces.</p></p>

<p><p>He shoved her into Soldier C. He grabbed her and pushed into Soldier B. Then he shoved her into Soldier A. They kept shoving her back and forth and laughing. B shoved her into the middle of the group.</p></p>

<p><p>She stood there, her arms crossed over her chest. She was like a deer in headlights, frozen in fear. They leered at her and laughed. As their laughter faded into the background, Faith remembered an event from earlier.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s back is against the desk, and she watched in horror as Blue approached her like a predator would its prey. Her pupils were dilated, her eyes shaking, her body trembling as if it is the end of the world.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue grabbed her arms and she gasped from the shock. Her grip on the towel was lost, and the towel slipped off her breasts and fell down to her feet. She was staring Blue directly in the eyes and frozen from shock. It took her a moment to realize that she&rsquo;s standing naked in front of him.</p></p>

<p><p>But she was given no time to process the shame. Blue leaned in and kissed her on the lips. Poor Faith could do nothing to resist. He kept on swallowing lips while leaning forward, forcing her to lean back.</p></p>

<p><p>Then they fell on top of the desk. Blue violated her and let himself loose. This time, it is truly over. She was naked and weak, and Blue is going to have his way with her.</p></p>

<p><p>The pain from those recent memories stung her heart like a scorpion&rsquo;s tail. And now, those memories are the loudest voice in her head. The soldiers&rsquo; mockery and sinister laughter have completely faded into background noise. Everything around them became darkness. The soldiers surrounded Faith in the darkness, and the room was spinning over and over, their laughing voices became echoes.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s arms dropped to the side, and her fists clenched tightly. Her grip was so tense, if she was holding an apple, it would have been crushed instantly.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith has been caught in a situation that was never fair to begin with. Ever since she was trapped in that block of ice, her fate has been sealed. She is powerless and unable to escape from this hellhole.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue was angry at those remarks. He became full of adrenaline and his grip on Faith&rsquo;s body tightened. His muscles popped veins and his arms squeezed her shoulders and legs, and she groaned in pain. He squeezed them without any regards to her well being, not caring if he breaks a bone or two, or even crush her completely.</p></p>

<p><p>All he cared about was his anger, and it so happens this unfortunate woman is in his arms at a time like this.</p></p>

<p><p>The pain became more intense...and there was nothing she could do while laying in this villain&rsquo;s arms. Tears dripped from her eyes...and fell to the floor. In Blue&rsquo;s arms, she was nothing but a helpless naked woman, her soft and frail body waiting to be crushed at any moment.</p></p>

<p><p>Her head titled upwards and her mouth opened and she moaned. &ldquo;Ughhhh.&rdquo; Her head tossed and turned and her moaning continued. It was the saddest moan any woman ever let out... it was a cry of pain and misery. It was the cry of a woman who was violated over and over...until she can&rsquo;t even open her eyes. And even in this unconscious state, she still has to suffer.</p></p>

<p><p>Blue continued to squeeze Faith&rsquo;s frail body with his arms as he grunted in anger. Faith moaned in agony as her body was being crushed. Blue became so angry that he lost control of himself and became charged with electricity. Faith&rsquo;s body was electrocuted and she screamed louder than ever before. She was being zapped while crushed at the same time, but the electricity was way worse and more deadly. She had never felt anything so painful in her life, and her head tossed and turned non-stop, and she screamed and screamed in the dark, empty room...</p></p>

<p><p>She stared at the floor. To these men, her body is nothing more than a sex toy, brought here for their amusement. Or maybe she&rsquo;s a present waiting to be unwrapped. Her body has been defiled and dirtied by these men, stained by their lust and desire. To them, she is not even a person, but just a woman&rsquo;s body they can use and toss away at their convenience. But her body is not a toy or a present, and she is tired of being treated this way. She is just sick and tired of it.</p></p>

<p><p>The soldiers did not notice that her eyes have changed. Soldier B came up from behind and placed his hand on her shoulder. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to scream for your life? What&rsquo;s wrong? Cat got your tongue?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, his hand got burned by her skin, as if he touched a grill. &ldquo;Aaaah! My hand!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Waves of sizzling energy surrounded her body - the energy took the form of flames. *Froom*</p></p>

<p><p>Everyone gasped in fear and awe.</p></p>

<p><p>Soldier A covered his face. &ldquo;W-What is this energy?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Soldier C checked the reading on his wrist scouter. &ldquo;What? Her power reading is over 33,000 and rising! I thought she was just an ordinary woman!&rdquo; By the time he said this, the actual reading on his scouter said 33,321.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; exclaimed Soldier D as he watched his companion&rsquo;s scouter. As he spoke, the number has risen to 35,300.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith powered up, expanding her area of effect, knocking Soldier B against the wall. *Wham*</p></p>

<p><p>Now weary of her newfound powers, the others took a few steps back, Her eyes were burning with anger. The flames engulfing her body were red and orange.</p></p>

<p><p>All Faith ever wanted was to live in peace and happiness - it&rsquo;s the only thing she wants and needs - yet she cannot have it. Her most basic rights and freedom as a person has been robbed from her, and she does not even know why.</p></p>

<p><p>She has been trained as a warrior her whole life and she&rsquo;s been in countless fights. And now, she finally has a chance to fight back and show these men she&rsquo;s more than just a piece of meat. It&rsquo;s time for payback!</p></p>

<p><p>All the flames on her body gathered around her fists, and her fists became a fireball. She charged forward like a car with a nitro boost, with much speed and force behind her movements and punched Soldier A in the stomach. *Thud*</p></p>

<p><p>Soldier A gasped from the sudden pain. Her fist delivered some pain, but the flames around the fist gave him a burning sensation, which doubled or even tripled the pain he felt. *Ugh!* He could not even move as her fist was buried into his chest, and he fell down.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith then glanced at Soldier C. He stepped back with open palms. &ldquo;Now...wait...let&rsquo;s talk about this, can&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She was not in the mood to talk. Not with her mouth, anyway. *Pow* She charged at him and uppercut him in the chin. He fell on the floor and was knocked out.</p></p>

<p><p>Soldier D rushed at her and punched. *Whoosh* She dodged his fist and grabbed his wrist, pulled him forward, and kneed him in the chin. *Wham*</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;AS2_ZeroMercy&quot;></a>Zero Degrees, Zero Mercy</p></p>

<p><p>Soldier A hurried over to the door, and as soon as it opened, a man appeared from the other side and his fist struck Soldier A in the abdomen, effectively knocking him out <strong>cold</strong>.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;To run away from an enemy is cowardly.&rdquo; said Azure.</p></p>

<p><p>All the soldiers were shocked that he was here. He had Faith&rsquo;s attention as well, as she recognized his voice.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s...Lord Azure!&rdquo; exclaimed Soldier B.</p></p>

<p><p>As Azure made his way into the room, the soldiers step to the side.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ohhh! Azure...it&rsquo;s said that his abilities are the deadliest in the Murai Assassin Squad.&rdquo; said Soldier C.</p></p>

<p><p>Soldier B also added: &ldquo;No one who&rsquo;s ever fought him has lived to tell about it...they&rsquo;ve all become frozen statues.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ohhh, did someone turn up the heat in the room?&rdquo; commented Azure.</p></p>

<p><p>As Faith listened carefully to his voice, she realized who it was - it was the guy who froze her after Spidey captured her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you...&rdquo; she muttered out loud. Her pupils dilated and her jaw remained open as if she&rsquo;s seen a ghost. One can hear the fear and surprise in her voice as she recalled the excruciating near-death pain she faced. Her body began to tremble as it remembers the pain of being frozen, the sensation of a thousand cold needles pricking her skin at the same time. It was so cold it felt like she was trapped in a refrigerator, but ten times colder than that. And then after the coldness came the numbness...she lost feeling in all her limbs and every part of her body.</p></p>

<p><p>Not only that, but last time she was naked and defenseless. She was caught by surprise, frozen from behind as she crawled pathetically on the ground. It was the worse case scenario anybody ever had to deal with. Her body was exhausted from all the struggling...she was exhausted even before she ran into Spidey. She used up all her energy to defend herself, and Spidey tortured her and injured her even more. By the time Azure showed up, she was already beaten half to death. Yet he froze her body with no remorse or hesitation whatsoever.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith did not even see what happened. Not knowing who or what did it, she continued to crawl like a snail until she became completely frozen.</p></p>

<p><p>Azure recognized her as well. &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re...the test subject. And this time you&rsquo;re wearing something. It&rsquo;s not much, but it&rsquo;s better than being naked, I guess.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s fingers clenched into a fist. Her fear was replaced by anger. Azure&rsquo;s comment made her extremely angry and humiliated. She was very well aware of what happened last time, but for him to say it out loud makes it even worse. This time it will be different than last time. Instead of lying face down on the floor, she was standing up...and instead of being butt naked, she was wearing a towel. She can actually defend herself and not be taken by surprise. This time she will not be a frozen statue.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s fist clenched tightly. She powered up and her fire continued to grow. Her hair was waving from all the energy, and now, it is as if she&rsquo;s a walking fireball. She understands that Azure is a strong opponent, unlike these foot soldiers, thus, she continued to power up to the maximum, pushing her ki and her body to its limits.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ohhh. Your power comes from your anger. Your ki is burning. Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t like hot temperatures. You need to cool down.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Try to cool this down!&rdquo; she shouted as she punched. *Froom*</p></p>

<p><p>He dodged her fist. Faith let out a fury of punches and Azure dodged them all and jumped away.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So hotheaded, I see. I will teach you to cool down with my ice.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Fire melts ice!&rdquo; Faith yelled.</p></p>

<p><p>She ran at him and punched and he evaded it just in time. He thought he evaded her attack perfectly, But the air pressure from her fist cut his face like a sharp knife.</p></p>

<p><p>This surprised him a bit. Azure was not phased, but rather impressed by the fact that she was able to cut his mask off. &ldquo;Not bad. The fact that you were able to even touch me is admirable.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Azure bent his knees and threw his palms forward like that of the horse stance, and began to power up. As his ki rose, so did the temperature around him drop. The spot which he stood on turned to ice, and the ice began to spread around him.</p></p>

<p><p>The soldiers watched in awe. &ldquo;So this is his specialty?&rdquo; said Soldier B.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith concentrated the fire on her body onto her right fist, and she ran at him. &ldquo;Hyaaaah!&rdquo; She punched his chest with all her might. *Thud*</p></p>

<p><p>But Azure did not budge at all, which surprised her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What? It didn&rsquo;t work?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Azure grabbed her wrist and pulled it away from his chest. The coldness in his palms made the flames on her fist disappear. Her eyes grew wide open with shock. Every second he was touching her wrist, it grew colder and colder, and she withdrew and stepped back.</p></p>

<p><p>She checked her wrist and was shocked. Not only was her wrist pale, but she cannot feel her wrist anymore, as if it&rsquo;s frostbite.</p></p>

<p><p> Azure smiled &ldquo;How unfortunate. Your flames might be hot, but my coldness is colder than you can imagine.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Azure took the offensive and punched, Faith blocked with her forearm. *Wham* She got pushed away. Not only did it hurt, but it felt as if her arm was being hit by solid ice. In fact, she can still see the ice particles flying away from her arm.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now, how&rsquo;s about I put out your fires...permanently?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith grunted angrily and concentrated her ki onto her fists. They became fireballs and she ran at him and punched with her right fist. He blocked it and clenched her fist in his grip. The fire disappeared.</p></p>

<p><p>She then punched with her left arm. *Pow* He grabbed the fist with his other hand, and he made the fire disappear. Faith was shocked that her flames were vanquished instantly by his cold aura.</p></p>

<p><p>Now that he has both her hands, Faith was unable to move. Her fists started to become frozen, starting with her knuckles, and shortly afterwards, her fingers, and her palms. Faith struggled to get free, and she moaned in pain as her hands are freezing over.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now...embrace the coldness.&rdquo; he said.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith gasped in fear. He pulled her into him and kissed her lips. His lips felt so cold it was like tasting a popsicle. And his breath was ice cold as well, as he breathed into her mouth, her insides grew cold, it felt like she was being frozen from the inside out. As the pain hit her, her eyes grew wide open and she let out a weak moan. &ldquo;Mmmmffffff!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She shoved him away and backed up. She panted for breath. Faith had never experienced such pain like this before, the sensation of a popsicle being shoved into her mouth, and to endure such coldness that it felt like her body&rsquo;s warmth, her life force, was being drained from her. Usually, a man&rsquo;s touch, particularly his lips, is warm and inviting, but this feeling is the complete opposite. This man, Azure, if he is a man at all, is truly made of ice, inside and out.</p></p>

<p><p>Even a kiss that lasts a few seconds will be fatal. If he had continued to kiss her for even a minute longer, her life could have ended already.</p></p>

<p><p>As she panted for breath, she stared at her hands and gasped. They were frozen solid like blocks of ice. They were numb and she cannot move her fingers any longer.</p></p>

<p><p>Azure smiled. &ldquo;What a shame, it looks like you can no longer use your hands for fighting. The human flesh is so nimble and weak. The blood is no longer flowing to your hands.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You...you bastard!&rdquo; Faith was done yet. She drew her leg back and thrust it forward, aiming the kick at his head. *Thud*</p></p>

<p><p>Azure blocked her leg with his forearm, and the moment that her leg came in contact with him, even though he&rsquo;s wearing clothes, it became frozen.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith lost strength in her right leg and fell on one knee. She noticed icicles on her shin, the part that came in contact with Azure. She tried to sooth her leg with her hands, but she just remembered they are frozen as well.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now do you see...the power of the coldness?&rdquo; taunted Azure.</p></p>

<p><p>Now with both her hands disabled, and one of her legs partially disabled, Faith realized that she can&rsquo;t win. She stood up on her feet and backed up as Azure approached her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...no...&rdquo; she murmured.</p></p>

<p><p>Azure stood in a horse stance and powered up like he did before. His area of effect is spreading throughout the entire room. The floor became ice...and it&rsquo;s spreading rapidly, like an expanding circle with Azure in its center.</p></p>

<p><p>Before she realized it, Faith was standing on ice, and she felt the cold with her bare feet. The ice was so cold it sent chills up her spine. By now, the room has become an ice skating ring.</p></p>

<p><p>It was so chilly that he soldiers hugged themselves and shivered, and their breaths can be seen.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that the coldness is absolute...millions of years ago, there was the great Ice Age, a time where the entire planet was frozen for eons. In such coldness, everything remains completely still, there are no movements, no sounds, only solitude...and death. It&rsquo;s a beauty to marvel at!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith stepped back as her hands clenched her chest. The temperature has dropped so slow that she can see her own breath, and it continues to lower by the second. Her back was now against the wall, and she has no where to go.</p></p>

<p><p>Fearing for her life, she panted for breath as Azure closed in on her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;And today, you get the distinct privilege of getting a preview of such a coldness.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...please...!&rdquo; she cried out.</p></p>

<p><p>Azure grabbed her by the upper arms and she gasped and her whole body shook. Her shoulders and biceps began to freeze over, and she moaned in dire pain. The ice began to reach her neck. Unable to do anything, she squirmed, and groaned out loud. &ldquo;Aaaah!! Aaaaah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;Shhh...&rdquo; he whispered as he stared at her face. &ldquo;Just relax. If you don&rsquo;t struggle it won&rsquo;t hurt as much, I promise.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith opened her eyes and just stared at him with a dumbfounded look on her face. What a strange thing for him to say at a moment like this. Is he actually trying to comfort her? No, it&rsquo;s not the words he say, but his tone of voice. It&rsquo;s so soothing and comforting that she may just want to give in.</p></p>

<p><p>And as she stared into his deep, blue eyes, she came to the realization that she has no hope of winning. No, the truth is, she had no hope of winning the moment Azure came into the room. That&rsquo;s just the level of opponent he is. But she got lost into his blue eyes, and felt genuine, pure fear for the first time in her life.</p></p>

<p><p>Azure closed his eyes and kissed her lips. Faith&rsquo;s eyes were shaking and tears drip down the corner of her eyes. He tightened his grip on her shoulders and the ice continued to spread down from her shoulders, almost reaching her elbows.</p></p>

<p><p>With her hands frozen and trapped between his chest and her own chest, she was helpless, like a lamb waiting to be slaughtered. All the anger she felt earlier was no longer there, replaced by fear and despair. What Azure froze was not just her body parts, but her fighting spirit as well.</p></p>

<p><p>When Azure finally let her lips go, Faith turned to the side and breathed hard, as if she been swimming under water for a long time and just came up for air. Her breath was chilly, and the insides of her mouth was so cold it&rsquo;s almost numb.</p></p>

<p><p>Then he put his hand between her thighs and moved into the towel. Faith&rsquo;s breath can be seen as she panted while he violated her down there. Not only was he touching her most private and sensitive area, but he was trying to freeze it like the other parts of her body. It felt chilly down there and she cannot take it anymore.</p></p>

<p><p>She shoved him in the chest, causing him to stumble backwards, and she ran away from the wall. With her arms crossed over her chest, she stepped backwards. &ldquo;No...don&rsquo;t...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Azure fired an ice beam at her. *Froom*</p></p>

<p><p>All her limbs became icicles and they cannot move. Even the towel had icicles on them. It became too heavy, and the towel slipped off her chest and fell down, revealing her naked body to everyone. Even though her body is covered in icicles, Azure can still see her breasts and everything else.</p></p>

<p><p>The soldiers leered at her.</p></p>

<p><p>A: &ldquo;Whoa...look what we&rsquo;ve got here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>B: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s finally naked. What a nice body she has!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was embarrassed by their lewd remarks. Her face turned bright red and her eyes were on the verge of tears.</p></p>

<p><p>C: &ldquo;Those breasts of hers are so round and firm. I want to feel them with my bare hands.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A: &ldquo;I want to do all sorts of things to her. Heh heh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Azure just stared at her like she&rsquo;s a piece of artwork. His eyes never blinked even once, and his mouth was wide open.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith tried desperately to move despite her condition. Some of her fingers can twitch a little bit.</p></p>

<p><p>Azure approached her with a grabbing gesture. &ldquo;I wonder how they feel...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Faith screamed and all the icicles broke off. *Crack* She covered herself privates with her arms and fell on her knees. She stared at Azure with sad, frightful eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>Azure: &ldquo;Ohhh. To be able to move in that state. Impressive. However, it all ends here. I will make sure you never move again.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He got into horse stance and powered up. His area of effect was expanding rapidly.</p></p>

<p><p>The ice started to spread from the floor and moved its away to all four corners. The spilled beer became frozen.</p></p>

<p><p>The soldiers can see their breaths and they grabbed their arms and shivered. Even the floor that Faith was kneeling on became ice, and felt cold to her legs. The ice continued to spread to the corners of the room as the temperature continued to drop drastically.</p></p>

<p><p>Even the walls were gradually turning to ice. The soldiers cannot handle this level of coldness any longer. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of here!&rdquo; They all left through the front door, and Soldier B hit the close button, and the metal wall closed behind them. *Slam*</p></p>

<p><p>Faith watched in horror as she felt the cold with her bare skin. The worst part of all this is that she has wearing anything at all, and she was kneeling on solid ice. Her arms were crossed over her breasts, her hands holding her shoulders, shivering and panting for breath.</p></p>

<p><p>Azure&rsquo;s energy bubble hit her, and she fell down, lying sideways. Azure walked over to her and lied down on her body. His hands held her wrists, which were already frozen. Her legs were trapped between his. And he put his face between her breasts. She screamed and tossed and turned.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Absolute zero - the coldest possible temperature. It is a state where nothing moves - not even the molecules or the electrons... it is permanently still. No movements, no sound, no nothing. It is a state of absolute perfection. The less you move, the less you struggle, the more beautiful you will become.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Coming in close contact with Azure, her body parts began to freeze. His fingers were intertwined with hers, and they became solid ice. Soon enough, her entire arm froze. Her stomach froze. Her legs kicked and thrashed about, but they became trapped in ice, and she kicked less and less. Eventually, her legs became motionless as they were completely frozen.</p></p>

<p><p>Her breasts became frozen as he touched them all over. Eventually, only her neck and head are left. Poor Faith was unable to feel her body anymore. The icicles pierced her neck.</p></p>

<p><p>They stared at each other in the face. &ldquo;No, please!&rdquo; she cried out like a wounded animal about to be slaughtered.</p></p>

<p><p>Azure kissed her lips. Tears stream down her face, but they soon turned into little balls of ice and fell on the ground. Eventually her face became frozen, and Azure was kissing a frozen head.</p></p>

<p><p>Then he touched her frozen face with his hand. &ldquo;Ohhh so beautiful. Marvelous. You look much better this way.&rdquo;</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="e">[ E ] - Final Confrontation </span></p></center>


<p><p>Angela rushed into the room. &ldquo;Guys!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Everyone became startled. &ldquo;Angela? What&rsquo;re you doing here?&rdquo; asked Nebula, surprised to see her in person.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve found Indigo&rsquo;s spaceship.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; exclaimed Zell.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Our scouts found them an hour ago. The ship came out of camouflage and landed somewhere in Eastwood Forest.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula pounded his fist. &ldquo;Alright. It&rsquo;s finally time for some action.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Angela: &ldquo;Remember who you&rsquo;re dealing with. These guys are professional assassins. Exercise utmost caution.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Neb: &ldquo;Yeah I know. Remember, Indigo is mine.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zell: &ldquo;Tyson, you stay here and rest. Leave the rest to us.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyke: &ldquo;I trust you. Please bring her back.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mac nodded. Zelfire smiled. They all fly out of the window.</p></p>

<p><p>Angela: &ldquo;Aye yai yai. What a restless bunch.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyke stood by the window and waved everyone goodbye, smiling. When they flew out of sight, Tyke&rsquo;s face got serious.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula walked about the forest until he found an empty area. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see, the ki signal should be around here.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A silhouetted figure came out of the woods, who was revealed to be Azure. Judging from his pale face and style of clothing, Nebula figured Azure is not human, but rather, a freak of nature.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, they sent only one of you?&rdquo; said Azure.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmph. I&rsquo;m surprised.&rdquo; said Nebula. &ldquo;I thought the Assassin Squad only relies on petty tricks and turning invisible to catch their enemies off guard. To show up in front of me, you&rsquo;re pretty brave.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Azure had this wicked grin on his face. &ldquo;Let me tell you something...only the weaklings need to turn invisible and hide their presence. There are those in the Assassin Squad whose abilities do not require them to hide in the shadows. Allow me, Azure, to demonstrate!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Azure clenched his fists, raised his arms, bent his knees, and charged up his aura. Everything around his body became ice cold - the water droplets became drops of ice and fell to the ground. The ground itself was turning into ice, starting from his feet, and expanding rapidly.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula was startled. The ice was nearly touching his feet. Seconds later, he was standing on ice, and the forest was cold. He can even see his own breath. &ldquo;So the rumors are true. You can freeze anything you touch. A frightening ability.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Fear is a good thing! Today I&rsquo;m going to show you the terror of the coldness!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m afraid of a little ice?&rdquo; Nebula floated up above the trees. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m up here you can&rsquo;t freeze me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You fool! You just made it easier for me to target you! Gyahaha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Nebula responded in shock.</p></p>

<p><p>Azure sucked up the air into his palms, forming icicles, and he threw them up. *Whoosh* Nebula dodged the icicles. *Whoosh* Azure made more icicles, he can form groups of them within seconds. Nebula drew his sword and slashed them into bits. *Crack*</p></p>

<p><p>When Azure grew tired of playing around, he floated up to Nebula&rsquo;s level. He smiled and gathered energy into his right arm, and the energy took the form of an ice sword.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula&rsquo;s eyes grew wide with shock.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of tricks I can do with ice.&rdquo; said Azure.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmph. That little toy won&rsquo;t make a dent on my sword.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I wonder about that! My ice isn&rsquo;t ordinary ice...I can freeze it to temperatures as low as absolute zero!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What? That&rsquo;s impossible!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Azure charged forward and slashed, and Nebula blocked it. *Clang* They have a sword fight in the air, exchanging blows. Nebula has more experience with the sword, so he should have an advantage, but he is struggling to keep up with Azure&rsquo;s speed. Nebula has to hold his sword with both hands, whereas Azure&rsquo;s entire right arm is the sword, leaving his left arm free to attack. *Clang clang*</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula flew down to the forest, Azure chased after him. *Froom* They flew past the trees at high speed, then Nebula landed on a tree branch. Azure landed on the same branch.</p></p>

<p><p>Azure licked his ice blade. &ldquo;Soon, you&rsquo;ll face the terror of all my previous prey. Face the terror of absolute zero!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re starting to creep me out, freak!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who you calling a freak, human?&rdquo; Azure cried out.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who you calling a human, freak?&rdquo; Nebula retorted.</p></p>

<p><p>They jumped and clashed their blades angrily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m from the planet Nebulon, do well to remember that!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who cares?!&rdquo; Azure cut the tree branch, and with Nebula being on end of it, he started to fall. He jumped off the branch and landed on the ground. Moments later, Azure landed in front of him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to add you to my collection, boy. These hands have frozen many lives...I just love the way my victims scream to their death...screaming in anguish and agony as their bodies become frozen and lifeless...until they can&rsquo;t make a sound anymore. Such a beautiful melody that is, gyahahaha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula became disgusted and the look in his eyes changed. He generally hates anyone in the Assassin Squad, but Azure takes the cake. The way he talks, and the things he does - everything about him is repulsive, and Nebula has never felt such contempt for anyone before. &ldquo;People like you make me sick. I&rsquo;m going to end your life no matter what!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Both fighters charged into each other and swing their blades. Nebula&rsquo;s blade cut through the ice and slashed Azure on the chest, causing <strong>blood</strong> to gush out. Azure jumped back and grabbed his wound.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aaaah!! The pain! Wha-what have you done?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Steel is harder than ice, moron. Did you really think your fake play sword can beat my steel sword, the one I&rsquo;ve used since I was a child?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Azure was hurting, and it&rsquo;s not just his shoulder, but his pride as well. &ldquo;You son of a bitch!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh Weren&rsquo;t you going to show me the terror or something stupid like that?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Azure laughed maniacally, causing his opponent to feel uneasy.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so funny? Did losing all that blood get to your head?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The ice man put his hand over his wound and it became frozen, causing the bleeding to stop.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What the!?&rdquo; Nebula is freaked out by this. &ldquo;You just froze your wounds?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m made of ice inside and out.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a freak inside and out!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula charged forward, holding his blade. Azure put his palms forward and fired the Ice Beam. Neb&rsquo;s sword became frozen solid. His hands became cold and he dropped the sword.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh, you&rsquo;re quick.&rdquo; said Azure. &ldquo;A second later and your hands would&rsquo;ve been frozen.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Azure fired the Ice Beam and Nebula countered with the Energy Blast. *Kaboom*</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;An attack of that level won&rsquo;t work.&rdquo; Nebula bragged.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ha, you fell for it! Look down!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula looked down and saw his feet was frozen. &ldquo;Ah, my feet! When did you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;While you were distracted by my Ice Beam, I froze your feet. Now you can&rsquo;t move, gya ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;Sneaky little bastard!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t move!&rdquo; Azure fired the Ice Beam.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula blocked with his hands, and his hands became frozen. &ldquo;Ugh!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Azure fired another wave of ice, and Nebula&rsquo;s legs are completely frozen now. The ice moved its way from his legs to his waist, up to his chest, and eventually, up to his shoulders and neck. All this happened in less than a minute. Nebula was snake bit, he stood there, unable to do anything, as his body became a block of ice.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Look at how helpless you are!&rdquo; the ice man taunted.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo; Neb cried out in disbelief. No matter how much he squirmed, his body didn&rsquo;t move an inch. He was frozen solid.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Once I freeze your head, you won&rsquo;t be able to breathe, and you&rsquo;ll die a slow, painful death. Then you&rsquo;ll be a complete ice statue...death can be a beautiful thing.&rdquo; Azure opened his palm and the ice slowly crept its way up Nebula&rsquo;s neck, and onto his chin.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No! Stop it!! Ugh!&rdquo; The ice covered his mouth and his nose, and eventually his entire head. All of his movements have stopped, Nebula became completely silent.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Another one added to my collection.&rdquo; Azure turned around and began to walk away. &ldquo;Corpses that remain frozen don&rsquo;t rot - they always stay the same way forever.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Azure heard a crack, and he became startled. The ice on Nebula&rsquo;s chest cracked, and the cracks grew bigger and bigger, until all the ice came off his body. Azure turned around in surprise.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula powered up and his body was filled with purple ki. &ldquo;You think that will keep me still?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way you could have...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Moron! You only froze the outside of my body, while the inside of my body remains hot. You may be able to freeze my body, but you can never freeze my ki and my anger!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You were able to summon your ki from your insides even in that state? I have underestimated you...let me know your name.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Nebula Spade.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Nebula, eh? I&rsquo;ll be sure to remember that name for all eternity...after I kill you instantly.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I wonder if you can.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Azure fired the ice beam and now that Nebula&rsquo;s all powered up, he can deflect it easily. Azure fired another ice beam, and Nebula knocked that one away into the trees. *Kaboom*</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula fired the Energy Blast with both hands. Azure ducked and glided on a trail of ice he made, and grabbed Nebula&rsquo;s torso.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you now!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hey! Let go!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Azure can freeze people just by being in contact them with them, and Nebula&rsquo;s back is turning into ice. It&rsquo;s rapidly spreading all over his stomach and his chest.</p></p>

<p><p>He thought victory was assured, until Nebula laughed. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You really are stupid, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula screamed and powered up. &ldquo;Hyaaah!&rdquo; The burst of energy released threw Azure into the air.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aaaaah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re going to get it!!&rdquo; Nebula leaped to the air and hit Azure a dozen times. *Pow pow pow* His fists of fury hit Azure all over - in the face, in the chest and the stomach. Nebula didn&rsquo;t care about aiming, he just wants to give his enemy a good pounding. Unable to do anything, Azure&rsquo;s face became bruised as he was constantly being hit. He spit blood on Nebula&rsquo;s shirt.</p></p>

<p><p>This is the moment Neb was waiting for, and he made sure to unleash all his anger and strength into this beating. *Pow pow pow* Nebula finished the combo by hitting Azure&rsquo;s back, knocking him into the ground. *Wham*</p></p>

<p><p>Neb landed smoothly on the ground. In a matter of minutes, the tides have turned in Neb&rsquo;s favor. Azure, now battered and bruised, was biting the dust. His face was bruised and blood was coming out of his mouth, and he had a few broken ribs. This is pain that he&rsquo;s never experienced before.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;All that talk about death. Why don&rsquo;t you experience it for yourself? The same death that you gave to all your victims?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;T-This is not over yet.&rdquo; Azure blurted out. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m going to die, I&rsquo;ll take you with me.&rdquo; He managed to get up on his knees, panting for breath and holding his wounds. He extended his arm forward and opened his palm. &ldquo;Heh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Neb wondered what he was planning, but figured it must be a bluff, so he crossed his arms.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I can freeze people just by a mere touch...but I can also freeze my blood.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Your blood?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! Look at your clothes!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Neb looked down and noticed bloodstains all over his black jacket. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your blood!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Azure squeezed his palm and the bloodstains became ice, and was spreading rapidly, as water would absorb a paper napkin. Neb stood in awe as his clothes were swallowed up by the ice. But then he smiled, and took off his jacket and threw it away.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Nice try, Azure. But a trick like that won&rsquo;t work on me.&rdquo; he bragged, pointing his thumb to himself.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s still blood on your skin!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Neb was shocked. It&rsquo;s true, when Azure coughed blood on him, some of it got on his face. Azure squeezed his palm, and the ice began to spread across Nebula&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Oh no! Shit!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Gya ha ha ha! It&rsquo;s over for you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s over alright...&rdquo; Neb said, sighing and closing his eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Azure felt a jolt of pain in his chest. He looked down and saw the tip of a sword sticking out of his right peck. &ldquo;What the...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula&rsquo;s sword pierced him from behind. &ldquo;Y-Your sword...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I must&rsquo;ve forgotten to tell you, I can move it at will.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never met an opponent like you...&rdquo; Azure coughed blood, and he collapsed.</p></p>

<p><p> Neb walked over to the corpse and pulled out his sword and swings it a few times to fling the blood away. He didn&rsquo;t want his blade to be tainted with Azure&rsquo;s blood. It was a hard battle, Neb proved that he&rsquo;s a step ahead when it comes to wits and cunning. Azure was an assassin in the truest since - a sick psychopath who enjoys killing people, but now, it&rsquo;s all over...for him.</p></p>

<p><p>This was a hard battle and a victory well earned, but there is still one more battle left for Nebula. And this next battle will be even harder, and could be the greatest trial of his life.</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire walked through the woods, searching for his opponent&rsquo;s ki. He stopped moving all of a sudden. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re there. Show yourself.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua, who was invisible, appeared in front of him. &ldquo;Very good. You&rsquo;ve improved since our last encounter. Hehe, it will be such a delight taking you out.&rdquo; He turned invisible again.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You...you&rsquo;re alive?&rdquo;<br>  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t underestimate the Assassin Squad.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Being invisible will not work this time.&rdquo; Zell replied confidently. &ldquo;The same trick won&rsquo;t work on me twice.&rdquo; He closed his eyes and focused on his other senses.</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua was actually above him, and he punched downwards. Zelfire opened his eyes and dodged it, consequently, Aqua hit the ground, making a small crater. Zelfire threw a punch into thin air, but he hit something solid. *Pow* It was Aqua&rsquo;s face. He turned visible and he fell down. *Wham*</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You can hide your visuals and even hide your ki, but your invisibility doesn&rsquo;t matter anymore. Without your invisibility, you have no more tricks left.</p></p>

<p><p>At your level of skill, you don&rsquo;t stand a chance. I suggest you surrender.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aqua wiped the blood off his mouth and stood up. Hehe. You&rsquo;re much stronger than I remembered. But you&rsquo;re wrong about one thing. I still have one more trick up my sleeve. Literally.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire was surprised. &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Notice the suit I&rsquo;m wearing? It&rsquo;s a special suit designed for me. It allows me to absorb energy from nearby sources. Watch and behold!&rdquo; Aqua&rsquo;s suit has this insignia on its chest, and also two of them are on his palms. This insignia is the hole that absorbs the energy into the suit. He opened his palms and spread them to the side, and all the dust and leaves began to get to absorbed into the insignias. Even the air itself was being sucked into his palms.</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire stood there in awe, marveling at the suit&rsquo;s abilities. He also noticed that his own life energy was being drained as well, slowly but definitely. He looked at his palm and saw sparkles coming out of it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s even absorbing my life energy! What a dangerous ability!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just your life energy, but all life energy! Hyah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire looked around and noticed that all the grass near Aqua has withered and dried up. The trees themselves lost their life energy, the leaves withered and fell down, and the bark has aged and fallen apart.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Last time, Tyson was supposed to have killed me. Yet I was still alive. Technically I was dead, but my vital organs were still intact.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua appeared behind Tyson and charged at him, ready to sink his claws into Tyson&rsquo;s neck. Tyson suddenly turned around and fired the Wrath Beam, and Aqua took the blast head on. His body was pushed back by the beam. &ldquo;Noooo!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Indigo brought whatever was left of my body back to his spaceship. My body was useless, but my brain and heart were still intact, so I was kept inside a glass tube for a while. Normally, it would be impossible to revive my body. But then they found the secret ingredient...that woman, I think her name was Faith.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Faith? You mean her healing abilities?&rdquo; said Zelfire.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh. Her ability surpasses even modern science, one as advanced as Murai&rsquo;s science. Indigo extracted her cells and put them into me, and my body regenerated at a fast pace. Before long, I regained consciousness. I was able to stand up and fight, yet my body is still incomplete. So Spidey designed a suit specifically for my body. &rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua was finally done absorbing everything, and he took a deep breath as if he just had a big meal.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m all powered up. Hehe. The stronger I get, the weaker you are. You have no chance of winning!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah, how about this?&rdquo; Zelfire shot the Energy Blast at him.</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua stuck out his palm and absorbed it, despite its massive size. &ldquo;I also forgot to mention - any energy attacks you throw at me are useless!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo; Zelfire exclaimed. He is even more shocked than before. &ldquo;This suit&rsquo;s ability is ridiculous!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh.&rdquo; Aqua charged forward at lightning speed. *Froom*</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire still had one more attack up his sleeve. &ldquo;Spirit Blast!&rdquo; Aqua jumped to avoid that one, and appeared in the sky. He dived down, opening his palm, Zelfire dodged it by a hair&rsquo;s length.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let me drain the rest of your energy! I&rsquo;ll turn you into a dried up corpse!&rdquo; Aqua said, trying to grab him with his palm.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No thanks!&rdquo; Zelfire replied while evading Aqua&rsquo;s moves. *Whoosh* Since he can&rsquo;t afford to even be touched, Zell had no choice but to dodge and step back.</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua rushed forward and reached or Zell&rsquo;s neck. Zell flew up to the sky. Being in the air will give him the advantage, since it will be harder for Aqua to grab him.</p></p>

<p><p>Zell gathered energy for the next ki attack.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Being in the air won&rsquo;t help you. The distance doesn&rsquo;t matter!&rdquo; Aqua pointed his palm at the sky and began the absorption process. It&rsquo;s as if his palm became a black hole, sucking everything in it&rsquo;s path. And Zelfire happened to be in its path.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh!!&rdquo; Zelfire&rsquo;s energy was being drained even from that distance, and not only that, he was being pulled down. &ldquo;This suit is too powerful!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;Hehehe! This was designed by the Assassin&rsquo;s Squad best scientist! Now come to papa! I&rsquo;ll drain your energy and your life force!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Not good!&rdquo; Zell cried out as he was being pulled down by a force stronger than gravity.</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua jumped up, rocketing himself towards the sky. Zelfire flew downwards, and it&rsquo;s only seconds before the two collide. *Bam*</p></p>

<p><p>One of them fell to the ground, causing an explosion and dust and smoke to rise. Zelfire landed on his feet, waiting for Aqua to recover. He knew that one hit would not be enough to defeat Aqua.</p></p>

<p><p>When the smoke cleared and the dust settled, surely, Aqua was standing there, still with a stupid grin on his twisted face. &ldquo;Not bad, earthling.&rdquo; He said, wiping the blood off his mouth. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad that wasn&rsquo;t a fatal blow, because I&rsquo;m still powered up from sucking your energy! Hehehe.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Be grateful you got any at all! Because you&rsquo;re not getting anymore!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Such strong words. But in truth, you&rsquo;re almost at your limit, aren&rsquo;t you? Your ki is almost empty, and you can barely stand up, let alone throw a punch.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Sadly, Aqua is right. Zell was exhausted, and he&rsquo;s panting for breath. If this fight lasts longer, he won&rsquo;t be able to keep up. He may last another five minutes at best.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s suck up the last bit of your energy! To the very last drop!&rdquo; Aqua charged at him and tried to grab him, Zelfire dodged and retreated. He avoided Aqua&rsquo;s insignia on his palm at all costs, even a slight tough is fatal. *Whoosh whoosh*</p></p>

<p><p>Zell stepped on muddy dirt, and his foot got sank into it, and he lost his balance. (Oh no!)</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua grabbed him by the neck, and slammed him against the tree. *Wham* Aqua raised him up a few feet and strengthened his grip on Zelfire&rsquo;s neck.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh, it&rsquo;s the end for you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The situation has taken a turn for the worst for Zelfire. Not only was his energy being drained, but he is in a stranglehold. Death is only moments away, if he doesn&rsquo;t do something soon.</p></p>

<p><p>He pounded his fists on Aqua&rsquo;s arm, but it was no use because Aqua has a freaky arm with veins popping out. Zell kicked his chest and pounded his arm, but it was no use. He was gasping for air and losing the strength to struggle. &ldquo;Ugh...uhhhh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Say nighty night. Hehehe.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You...fell for it!&rdquo; Suddenly, Zell was smiling. He was in dire pain, but he forced himself to smile.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What the hell are you talking about? Are you delusional?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zell grabbed Aqua&rsquo;s wrist with both hands, and removed it from his neck, just enough so he can slide down on the tree. Then he took Aqua&rsquo;s hand and placed it against its owner&rsquo;s chest. <br>  &ldquo;Aaaah!&rdquo; screamed Aqua. His palm was sucking energy from his chest. He tried to pull it apart with his other hand, but it was stuck tighter than superglue. &ldquo;Get it off! Get it off!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So, that&rsquo;s what I thought would happen.&rdquo; said Zelfire. &ldquo;By placing your palm on yourself, you are draining your own energy. The suit gives you energy, so in essence, you&rsquo;re recycling your own energy. But your own body can&rsquo;t handle the pressure, and it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before your organs completely disintegrate.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You! Ugh!&rdquo; Aqua fell on his knees. All this time, he was still trying to pry his hand off his chest. &ldquo;This was your plan?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It was just a hunch, but it worked out better than I expected.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You...ugh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> Zelfire continued to explain: &ldquo;When you mentioned that your body was incomplete, that gave me the clue. That suit not only gives you energy, but it keeps you alive. Because your own body is incomplete, you need constant energy to replenish your body.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You...son of a bitch!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This must be painful. Let me end your suffering.&rdquo; Zelfire gathered energy for the Energy Blast, and he let it all go in one shot. *Bang*</p></p>

<p><p>Aqua saw the light coming, but he was unable to do anything, and just let the white light hit him in the face. *Bammm* In one instant, he no longer felt any pain, in fact, he felt nothing. Even though Aqua hated death, somehow, this feels right. After his fight with Tyson, he was supposed to die, but the miracle of science brought him back. But now, he&rsquo;s returning to his rightful place, the place where all of his other victims belong. Maybe this is retribution, or maybe this is his reward...but in any case, his mission is over now.</p></p>

<p><p> After the explosion, nothing was left of Aqua except a piece of his suit. Zelfire walked over to the nearest tree. &ldquo;What a powerful opponent. But he&rsquo;s gone now. I have to take out Indigo next...but I&rsquo;m tired, I need a little rest.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He was not just tired, but completely exhausted and barely able to stand up. He leaned his back on the tree, and sat on the ground. Zell closed his eyes and fell asleep.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson was in bad shape, but he managed to find the spaceship by himself. It has docked on the ground with its hatch open. It connected to the ground diagonally. Two soldiers with rifles stood on each side of the hatch.</p></p>

<p><p>When they saw Tyson, they pointed their rifles at him. &ldquo;Hold it. Take one step further and you&rsquo;re dead.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyke: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have time to play with you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Soldier D: &ldquo;Wait a minute. He&rsquo;s the sayan that beat up Commander Blue.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They both grew nervous.</p></p>

<p><p>Soldier E: &ldquo;No way! It&rsquo;s him?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Soldier D: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re no match for him!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Soldier E noticed Tyson has his hand on his chest and he&rsquo;s short of breath.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Not to worry. He&rsquo;s injured, see? We have weapons and he doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>E pointed his rifle at him. Tyson ran forward and grabbed the gun with one hand, crushing it. E was shocked. Tyson punched him in the face. *Pow* In an instant, his nose was broken and he fell down.</p></p>

<p><p>D tried to punch. Tyson blocked it and punched him in the stomach, grabbed his arm and did an overhead throw. *Wham*</p></p>

<p><p>More soldiers came out of the ship&rsquo;s hatch. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an intruder, get him!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have time for this!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The soldiers charged at him. Tyson screamed and rushed forward.</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="f">[ F ] - Copy Cat 
</span></p></center>

<p><p>Mac followed the ki signal to his target. He found Spidey waiting for him. After looking at Spidey for a few seconds, Mac became repulsed by his physical features - his goggles, long nose, and his skinny and hunched back torso. Nothing was appealing about him whatsoever.</p></p>

<p><p>Mac face palmed himself. &ldquo;Ugh, I always get the outcasts and freaks.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hey, who&rsquo;re calling a freak, human?&rdquo; Spidey retorted.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just get this over with.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hehe, I&rsquo;ll have you know, out of everyone in the Assassin Squad, I&rsquo;m the smartest and wittiest one.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I highly doubt that.&rdquo; Mac got into fighting position.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh Indigo, there you are!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Mac looked behind him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You fell for it!&rdquo; Spidey shot webbing out of his wrist and caught Mac&rsquo;s hands.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh! You dirty little!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hehehe! I told you I&rsquo;m full of wit! My web is a special substance designed in a lab. You can&rsquo;t pull it off no matter how hard you pull. Hyahaha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmph. I expected nothing more from the Assassin Squad.&rdquo; said Mac. His tone was different than before, as if he has a secret up his sleeve...literally. The web became electrified and melted off his arms.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Spidey exclaimed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not the only one who has inventions.&rdquo; Mac ripped off his sleeve, revealing his metallic gauntlets, the ones that he always brings to battle. &ldquo;I made these gauntlets myself. They have offensive and defensive power. You could say they are my life&rsquo;s proudest achievement.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey grew annoyed as Mac kept talking.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to see firsthand this weapon&rsquo;s offensive power!&rdquo; Then Mac put his palms forward and fired the Electro-shockwave. *Zappp*</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey jumped away from the line of fire. Mac fired at the ground and Spidey jumped into the trees. *Zap* Spidey grabbed the tree branch and swings on it like a monkey. He jumped to the ground, all this time avoiding the shockwaves.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hehehe! In the Assassin Squad I&rsquo;m the fastest and most versatile one!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mac continued to fire shockwaves and Spidey just dodged them with back flips. He shot webbing at Mac&rsquo;s feet.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You think this will stop me?&rdquo; Mac shot a smaller shockwave at his feet, destroying the web. But his enemy was no where to be found. &ldquo;Where did he go?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mac walked around, searching for his enemy&rsquo;s ki signal. But Spidey&rsquo;s presence was hidden well, even his ki is hard to find. Mac grew extra cautious, knowing that Spidey plays dirty.</p></p>

<p><p>While hiding, Spidey analyzed Macintosh with his goggles. &ldquo;Hehehe. His power level is low and that means he&rsquo;s weak. This should be a piece of cake.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mac&rsquo;s eyes glanced around, his head turned left and right, searching for any signs of the enemy. But he found nothing unusual about the trees, the grass, or even a hint of danger. This is a bad situation for Mac, as he is completely out in the open while his enemy is hidden.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, he heard a rustling in the trees. Mac fired a shockwave and destroyed a tree branch, but it was just a squirrel. He sighed in relief. Spidey jumped out from the bushes and shot a web, tying up Mac&rsquo;s arms to his torso.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;Got you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey then pulled his end of the web, forcing Mac to move up, and now he&rsquo;s hanging from the branch.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ha! You&rsquo;re done for now! Gya ha ha ha.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mac was surprised at the sudden danger of his situation. It all happened in less than 5 seconds.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps I will make you the subject of my experiments. We can never have too many human ginea pigs.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;In your dreams, pal.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Macintosh&rsquo;s shirt retracted, and he landed on the ground. Spidey was startled and did not have time to react as Mac hit him with his signature shockwave move. *Zap*</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey fell on his back. &ldquo;Ugh! How did you free yourself?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My shirt is actually an invention that I developed. It can expand and retract by my will. It&rsquo;s good for sticky situations like these.&rdquo; Macintosh was now only wearing a black tank top.</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey bounced back on his feet. &ldquo;So you deceived me, eh? I have a secret of my own too.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How can you stand up after taking a direct hit from my shockwave?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh. That&rsquo;s my secret...my suit protects me from electricity. It is an invention that I developed with my genius intellect!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You seem so proud of yourself. You just develop weapons to kill others! You&rsquo;re no scientist.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Shut up! What do you know?&rdquo; Spidey fired webbing. Mac dodged by back flipping away. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the same as me a scientist!&rdquo; He fired another stream of webbing, and Mac jumped over it.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the same as you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Science has nothing to do with morality!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mac jumped to the air, and the webbing hit his shoulder. &ldquo;Crap!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey pulled the web, causing Mac to fall down. *Wham* Then he swings the web, causing Mac to hit a tree. Then he fired more webbing, gluing Mac&rsquo;s right arm to the tree.</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey was confident about his victory and let out another one of his annoying laughs. &ldquo;I got you now.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mac struggled in vain, no matter how much he pulled, the webbing will not come off.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now...say goodnight!&rdquo; Spidey opened both palms, preparing to fire more webbing.</p></p>

<p><p>What he did not know was that Macintosh held a remote control in his right fist, it was hidden because his fist was closed. He pressed the red button on it. Under his tank top lies a metallic chest plate, it was placed there just for this very purpose. The chest plate released an ultrasonic sound wave. *Whoosh*</p></p>

<p><p>All the birds in the area flew away. When it hit Spidey, he shut his ears with his hands and screamed in agony. &ldquo;Aaaagh! What is this shit?!&rdquo; His goggles shattered into pieces. &ldquo;Ugh...ahhh...&rdquo; Spidey fell on his knees.</p></p>

<p><p>Mac zapped his right arm and freed himself from the webbing. &ldquo;Phew, good thing I brought these.&rdquo; He took the ear buds out of his ears.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You...had another weapon up your sleeve?&rdquo; Spidey asked. &ldquo;How dirty...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmph. How ironic...someone from the Assassin Squad calling me dirty.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey&rsquo;s goggles no longer work, and his vision was blurry. &ldquo;Take this!&rdquo; He fired webbing, but it missed completely.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I see. Your vision is naturally bad, that&rsquo;s why you need those goggles to help you see.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So what, huh? I can still kick your ass!&rdquo; Spidey charged forward.</p></p>

<p><p>Mac waited patiently, then charged forward and let out everything he had. He punched Spidey in the face, followed by a series of punches to the chest. *Thud thud thud* Mac was not a naturally violent person, but this is a special case. He only met Spidey minutes ago, but he has never hated anyone this much before. *Pow pow pow*</p></p>

<p><p>Spidey was helpless as he took all these punches to his face and chest. &ldquo;Ugh! Ooh! Ugh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mac finished up with a roundhouse kick to the face. *Wham* Spidey was tossed to the air and fell into the bushes.</p></p>

<p><p>He was always a physically fragile fighter and always avoided fights, so Spidey was not used to pain. But now, he just received the beating of his life. He was battered and bruised all over, and his vision failed him. His face was bruised all over, blood was dripping down his lips, and all his ribs were broken.</p></p>

<p><p>This was the humiliation of a lifetime for Spidey. He never thought this was even possible, and his morale was at an all time low. So this is what it means to be helpless and receive pain, huh? For the first time ever, he was thinking about his subjects&rsquo; feelings. He realized that this is what he was doing to all his live subjects, torturing them until they die of exhaustion. But he had no time to think, his body was tired and he fell unconscious.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula wandered the forest alone for an undetermined amount of time, that is, until his next opponent appeared. Indigo was searching for him as well, so they both appeared out in the open field. Indigo&rsquo;s appearance was nothing special - he is a middle aged man with a growing beard, dressed in a white robe like a priest. Nebula can sense his strong ki.</p></p>

<p><p>(This guy is the real deal. I better not underestimate him.)</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh? I was expecting to fight Tyson.&rdquo; said Indigo. &ldquo;How disappointing.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sorry to disappoint you.&rdquo; Neb replied sarcastically. &ldquo;You beat Tyson when his guard was down. Can you really call that a victory?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Even if his guard was up, he still would have lost. Still, I wanted to see his super sayan transformation.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s true. Your true goal is to become a super sayan.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;And what if it is?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, but that ain&rsquo;t happening. Because you&rsquo;re going to be defeated by me today.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Indigo smirked. &ldquo;Those are quite the confident words, young lad. Your eyes reveal that you&rsquo;re serious. Heh. I hope you can back up your words.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My sword does the talking for me.&rdquo; Nebula drew his sword from his back. He charged forward and attacked ruthlessly.</p></p>

<p><p>Indigo dodged the incoming onslaught with swift movements. It&rsquo;s as if his body was a rubber band, bending his torso in any direction he wills it to dodge the blade. *Whoosh whoosh* No matter how hard Nebula tried, Indigo dodged his blade. His feet were fast and his upper body was flexible and Nebula couldn&rsquo;t touch him. Despite that, Nebula kept slashing about, hoping at least one of his hits will connect.</p></p>

<p><p>They both jumped away from each other.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmph. I know why you are using the sword.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh. I know about your ability to copy other&rsquo;s moves. Like hell I&rsquo;m going to let you see one of my mine.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh? Can you really last in a fight against me without using one of your moves?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula dashed forward, intending to put all his force into this attack. His feet were barely touching the ground due to the speed of his dash. Indigo showed no signs of fear or worry at all. He raised his arm and threw a thunderbolt forward. It hit Nebula&rsquo;s sword, and he swings the blade, blocking the thunderbolt, and continued his dash.</p></p>

<p><p>Indigo formed the Electro-shield. Nebula&rsquo;s sword hit the shield but he was unable to get inside. &ldquo;Uhhh...this is Tyson&rsquo;s move!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Indigo released the shield and zapped Nebula with lightning out of his palm. Nebula was knocked away, his body scraping the dirt. There was smoke coming out of Indigo&rsquo;s palm. He closed his palm.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula was biting the dust. &ldquo;Ughhh...&rdquo; He stabbed the sword into the ground and used it as a crutch to stand up.</p></p>

<p><p>Indigo raised his arm again, and Nebula knew what was coming. He flew to the sky as Indigo became a lightning rod, charged with electricity.</p></p>

<p><p>Not wanting to stick around, Nebula flew away. Indigo floated up to the sky and chased his opponent. He was right on Nebula&rsquo;s tail, and threw thunderbolts. Nebula dodged left and right. *Zap zap*</p></p>

<p><p>One of the thunderbolts hit him in the back, causing Nebula to fall into the trees. *Wham*</p></p>

<p><p>Indigo landed slowly. There was a cloud of dust where Nebula fell. Suddenly, the was blown away when Nebula powered up.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You are quite the resilient one. How about this?&rdquo; He fired the ice beam.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula evaded but it scraped his right arm.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You barely dodged that one. You were almost frozen!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You must&rsquo;ve copied that move from Azure.&rdquo; Nebula put his left hand over his frozen elbow and zapped it with his ki. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s all you can do, huh. Don&rsquo;t you have any of your own moves?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need any.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You want to see one of my moves so badly? I&rsquo;ll show you something you can&rsquo;t copy!&rdquo; Nebula gathered all the ki he could from his body and summoned a big blue ball over his head.</p></p>

<p><p>Indigo&rsquo;s eyeballs began to change shape, which activates his copy function. He observed Nebula&rsquo;s every movement and detail.</p></p>

<p><p>The Nebulon Blast is Nebula&rsquo;s final move he uses to end a fight, a move that he relies on time and time again. But it is really taxing on the body since it uses up a lot of ki. It takes the shape of a glowing blue ball with a ring in the center, making it look like Saturn. The ball is size of a house, and upon impact will cause a big explosion.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s see how you will avoid this! Nebulon Blast!&rdquo; Nebula released the big blue ball and it flew towards Indigo.</p></p>

<p><p>Indigo knew he was in danger, so he put his hand on the ground and created a wall of ice in front of him. The ice surrounded him on three sides - the front, left and right, creating a fortress of safety.</p></p>

<p><p>The Nebulon Blast hit the ice wall and exploded. *Kaboom!* Nebula covered his eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>Minutes later, the dust cleared and the smoke settled, and the level of brightness returned to normal. &ldquo;Did it get him?&rdquo; Nebula wondered.</p></p>

<p><p>But he saw Indigo standing and unharmed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What? You survived the Nebulon Blast and there&rsquo;s not even a scratch on you? How can that be?&rdquo; Then he noticed the ice crystals around Indigo&rsquo;s feet.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I used one of Azure&rsquo;s techniques called the Ice Wall. It protects my body even from a strong blast like yours. It is the ultimate defense.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>(This is not good. I used up most of my ki for the Nebulon Blast.)</p></p>

<p><p>Indigo smirked. &ldquo;Looks like you&rsquo;re just about done. I have some bad news for you...I now know how to use your technique.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula&rsquo;s eyes grew wide open. &ldquo;No...way! You&rsquo;re bluffing!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Find out for yourself if I&rsquo;m bluffing or not.&rdquo; He raised his arms up and gathered energy to form a little blue ball in his palms. The blue ball grew bigger and bigger.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula was shocked. &ldquo;No...you can copy my strongest move just by seeing it once?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late to be surprised, boy!&rdquo; The blue ball grew to the size of a car and it continued to expand by the second. It was only a matter of time before it became as big as a house, and then it is ready to be launched. &ldquo;How does it feel to be defeated by your own technique?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula was in dire trouble. He had to think fast or he&rsquo;ll be blown to bits. Even if he tried escaping, there is no defense against the Nebulon Blast. He had only one option left - he formed the Nebulon Blast too.</p></p>

<p><p>Although this is a bad idea, he didn&rsquo;t have much of a choice. He&rsquo;s only supposed to use this move once, as it drains most of his ki. And now he&rsquo;s using it a second time, which poses a great risk to his body. But he has no time to think about the consequences right now...it&rsquo;s do or die!</p></p>

<p><p>Indigo&rsquo;s blue ball is as big as a house, and Nebula&rsquo;s blue ball is almost as big, minus a few inches. They were both ready for the bloodshed.</p></p>

<p><p>Indigo released the Nebulon Blast first, and Nebula released his Nebulon Blast, and the two large energies crashed in the middle. This has never happened before, so Nebula did not know how big the impact was going to be. When the two energies touched, the entire ground shook. The two blue balls exploded, resulting in an explosion so big that one can see it from space. *Kaboom!*</p></p>

<p><p>The entire forest was nearly decimated from the blast. Nebula was blown away, and so was Indigo.</p></p>

<p><p>Nearly 10 minutes have passed since, although it felt like an eternity for the fighters. Nebula coughed from the dust and stood up. He saw no signs of his enemy, so he floated to the sky. There was nothing but dust below him and he can&rsquo;t sense the enemy&rsquo;s ki. Normally, this means he&rsquo;s dead, but Nebula knows how crafty Indigo can be, and he won&rsquo;t assume anything until he sees a body.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, a thunder bolt hit Nebula&rsquo;s back, knocking him into the ground.</p></p>

<p><p>Indigo laughed. &ldquo;Ha ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula stood up.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just about done, aren&rsquo;t you? You shouldn&rsquo;t even be able to stand.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The same goes for you.&rdquo; Nebula replied. &ldquo;You just used the Nebulon Blast, not knowing what it does to your body.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes...you used it twice. And I&rsquo;ve only used it once. That means...I still can use it one more time.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula&rsquo;s eyes grew wide open. &ldquo;No way...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Do you still think I&rsquo;m bluffing? Ha ha ha!&rdquo; Indigo raised his arms in the air and formed a blue ball in his palms.</p></p>

<p><p>No longer having the energy to stand up, Nebula fell on his knees. Indigo can still use the Nebulon Blast, yet he cannot because he is completely drained since he used it twice already. This is a very bad scenario for our hero. The enemy will finish charging his final attack at any time now, and Nebula doesn&rsquo;t have a way to defend himself. He&rsquo;s out of energy, out of options, and out of luck.</p></p>

<p><p>He stared at the ground and pounded his fist on the dirt in frustration. Did he come this far just to get killed? He has no moves left...except for that move...a forbidden move that he never uses.</p></p>

<p><p>He promised never to use it, but his life is on the line, and he&rsquo;s moments away from death, so what else does he have to lose?</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Say your last prayers!&rdquo; said Indigo. By now, the blue ball is twice the size it was before.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula stood on his feet. &ldquo;I still have <strong>that</strong>...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>It happened that one particular night when Nebula was a young teen. Him and his father, Mason were standing on the fields under a starry night.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Alright Nebula. I promised to teach you a technique, so tonight I&rsquo;m going to teach it to you.&rdquo; said Mason.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Alright! I can&rsquo;t wait.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But this is a forbidden technique, so you must never use it, understand?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes father!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is a move I didn&rsquo;t even teach Tyson. This is called the Death Star.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wow, what a badass name!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But this technique strains your body and drains your energy. Are you ready?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You betcha!&rdquo; Nebula replied enthusiastically.</p></p>

<p><p>So, Nebula stood still like a statue and took deep breaths before the ordeal, as Mason instructed. He held out his right hand, and his left hand held his right wrist for support. The dark energy slowly gathered into his palm.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing it! Wow!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. You&rsquo;re doing good, son!&rdquo; said Mason.</p></p>

<p><p>Just when he thought he was doing well, his right arm started shaking. &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Watch your breathing and steady your ki. Channel your ki into one point.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh...&rdquo; Nebula focused even harder. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way...this will get the better of me!&rdquo; The dark energy in his palm stabled and maintained its spherical form. Then it vanished. Nebula panted for breath.</p></p>

<p><p>Ever since that time, Nebula has known how to use the Death Star, although he has not used it since. But this situation is a dire one, he is out of ki and out of strength, so he has no choice but to disobey his father&rsquo;s words and use the forbidden move.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Every time Tyson gets to be the hero. But this time&rsquo;s my turn to be the main character!&rdquo; Nebula squeezed every thing he had into the black ball of death. Due to the density of the dark energy, it is unstable and even maintaining it is hard. His arms were shaking and he might lose his grip at any time, but he persevered.</p></p>

<p><p>One mistake and he can lose his arm, since dark energy is very difficult to control. But it can be even worse, he can lose his life to the dark energy. It is a technique that can kill its user, and that is Mason&rsquo;s reason for forbidding Nebula to ever use it.</p></p>

<p><p>Indigo was bewildered as he watched his enemy. He did not know what that black ball is, but he can sense its energy. It is a terrible force that sucks everything into its darkness, an energy that destroys all things living and not living - this is the nature of dark energy. And the Death Star is nothing but a ball of condensed dark energy.</p></p>

<p><p>Indigo fired a lighting wave through the ground, hitting Nebula. But he withstood the attack. Finally, he was done with the Death Star. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s over Indigo...this is one move you can never copy.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He threw the Death Star forward. Indigo flew away from it.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Escaping is useless.&rdquo; said Nebula. &ldquo;The Death Star will chase you until it destroys you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Indigo stopped flying and fired a bunch of beams at it, but the Death Star absorbed all of them. &ldquo;Crap!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Indigo flew into the trees. The Death Star followed his trail, destroying all the trees it touched.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t escape it, then I will block it! Hyah!&rdquo; He decided to summon the Ice Wall to protect himself. He used all the ki he had left to make sure the ice was extra solid, and encased his body inside of it. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if you can hurt me!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula smirked. &ldquo;Bad idea...the Death Star will destroy everything in its path.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The black ball of death touched the ice and absorbed all of it. Indigo screamed.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula: &ldquo;Your best chance was to run away. But instead, you trapped yourself, causing your own doom.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The black ball absorbed Indigo&rsquo;s body, and he screamed in agony as his arms turned to dust. Then his shoulders, his torso, and everything that is him. Although it only lasted seconds, Indigo faced an agonizing death.</p></p>

<p><p>*Kaboom*</p></p>

<p><p>Outside the ship, there lies a dozen bodies of soldiers in uniform. Most of them were unconscious, either that or dead. Those who were still alive and conscious were shaking in pain. The trail of fallen bodies continue into the hallway.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson broke into the lab, startling the soldiers. He saw Faith unconscious inside a glass tube. The soldier closest to him punched him in the face. Other than tilting his head a little, Tyson showed no pain or reaction, which scared the soldier. He got upset and grabbed the soldier&rsquo;s hands, and head butt him in the face. *Wham* He got a broken nose and fell unconscious instantly.</p></p>

<p><p>The second soldier ran away, but Tyson appeared before him, and he gasped. Tyson grabbed him and shoved his knee into the soldier&rsquo;s stomach, causing him great pain before he fell down. *Thud*</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson was too tired to stand up and he grabbed his wounds and fell on his knees, but the keyboard panel broke his fall. &ldquo;Ugh...Faith...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She was sleeping in the glass tube, filled with water, or some form of liquid. She was naked, wrapped in a towel, with wires attached to her limbs. Despite the wires and the mechanical surroundings, she still looks beautiful, like an angel who&rsquo;s been sleeping for a hundred years. Since they were separated, Tyson had a hard time sleeping or eating, or even thinking. All he could think about was to get Faith back, all his energy was focused into that single goal. And now, his goal has finally been accomplished.</p></p>

<p><p>He pushed the red button on the keyboard, and then fell down on the floor. The machines started making mechanical noises, and the glass tube door released some air. The water was drained the chamber, and the wires detached from her body. Finally, the door opened, and she fell out of it, along with a puddle of water.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson crawled forward, reaching his hand for her. &ldquo;F-Faith! Wake up! Wake up!&rdquo; She was all the way across the room, and it felt like she&rsquo;s very far from him. He screamed her name desperately, while inching his way towards her.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s eyes blinked a little, and as Tyson kept calling her name, she came into consciousness. Her vision was blurry and her hearing was distorted, but there&rsquo;s a man&rsquo;s voice crying out her name, and he sounds like Tyson. Then she became fully awake and saw Tyson in front of her. &ldquo;Tyson!&rdquo; she said.</p></p>

<p><p>As he crawled towards Faith, she crawled towards him. Eventually, their fingers touched and they held each other&rsquo;s hands tightly. &ldquo;I found you at last.&rdquo; he said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d come for me.&rdquo; she replied.</p></p>

<p><p>To be reunited under these circumstances was not exactly the ideal reunion. But in that moment, they forgot about the fact that they are in the enemy&rsquo;s spaceship. They are inside a lab with broken machines, broken glass and water on the floor, and two other unconscious soldiers. Enemies could pop into the room at anytime. But all they can see is each other, all they have is each other...it is a world for two.</p></p>

<p><p>After a long battle, Nebula finally got a moment of peace. His clothes had holes and tears in them, and he was battered and bruised. Even standing up is hard. But he used the last ounce of his strength to perform one final duty.</p></p>

<p><p>He contacted Angela with his headset. &ldquo;Yo.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Nebula? Is everything okay?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Indigo&rsquo;s been taken care of by yours truly.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No way!&rdquo; Angela replied in shock. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe? Indigo&rsquo;s been defeated?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never have to worry about him again.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wow, you did a great job, Nebula.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula looked up at the bright blue sky. &ldquo;Finally, I get to show off for once.&rdquo; he said.</p></p>

<p><p>He was tired of Tyson being the main character and the one who always saves the day. It feels pretty damn good to defeat the main villain and be the hero - even if it&rsquo;s this one time. He has proven to himself and others that his fighting level is on par with Tyson&rsquo;s, and even without Tyson, he can hold his own. The sky has never looked bluer and more beautiful than today.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now if you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;m a little tired...&rdquo; With that said, he let himself fall on his butt and let out a big sigh. Then he just lied down on the grass and laughed heartily.</p></p>

<p> <p>The End</p></p>
