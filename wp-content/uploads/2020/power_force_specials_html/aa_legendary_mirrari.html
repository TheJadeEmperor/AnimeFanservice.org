<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="a">[ A ] - The Cursed Jewel </span></p></center>

<p><p>A guy dressed in rags was running through the forest. Most of his face was hidden except for the bottom half, revealing a mustache and beard. His clothes had patches and holes in them, suggesting that he is a beggar. But he is no ordinary beggar, for in his possession is a jewel that is centuries old.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was taking a midnight stroll and noticed a full moon. It was bright and big and hard to ignore. She sensed the beggar coming towards her before he even appeared within sight. Naturally, she was alarmed and was ready to bring out her weapons if needed.</p></p>

<p><p>The beggar stood within three feet away from her. &ldquo;Are you the Princess of Almerak?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes. Who are you?&rdquo; Faith&rsquo;s instincts sensed no danger from this man. In fact, he seemed like he has a message for her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter who I am. I have something to deliver to you.&rdquo; He walked up to her and handed her a large bag. Once it lay on her palms, he opened the bag, revealing a glowing orb.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; she asked, captivated by the orb. Its shine was bright and eye catching like that of a diamond. It is no ordinary orb for sure. She sensed something mysterious and powerful...with a lot of history behind it. Its shine is one that says it can bring immense joy or eternal damnation to its possessor.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is the Mirarri, the legendary cursed jewel.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The Mirrari?&rdquo; Faith looked up at the beggar. The name sounds familiar, something mentioned in the Sacred Scrolls, but she did not remember what it was about.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Rubeus has been looking for it. The only safe place is with you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The beggar just unloaded a lot of information at once. But before she could ask any questions, he ran away. Then she fixed her gaze the orb. She has a feeling that it will change her destiny and the destiny of her kingdom as well.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith brought the orb to the basement and placed it on a shelf. Suddenly, the Mirrari glowed and the entire room flashed for a split second. Faith&rsquo;s body flashed along with it and she was startled. She felt no changes in her body or mind so she shrugged it off.</p></p>

<p><p>The door opened and Tyson walked in. &ldquo;Honey I&rsquo;m home.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was wearing an apron over her clothes and she ran towards him. &ldquo;Tyson!&rdquo; She gave him a warm embrace, her arms wrapped around his neck. &ldquo;I missed you.&rdquo; She gave him a kiss on the lips.</p></p>

<p><p>He was pleasantly surprised. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s gotten into you all of a sudden?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been alone all day and I&rsquo;m happy to see you.&rdquo; She took him by the hand and led him towards the single man couch. &ldquo;Have a seat.&rdquo; She handed him a glass of lemonade.</p></p>

<p><p>He proceeded to drink it while she gave him a shoulder massage. &ldquo;Well...is it good?&rdquo; she asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The lemonade...yeah the taste is just right.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>That compliment made her happy on the inside. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you like it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson relaxed while he received the massage. &ldquo;This is nice...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make us dinner.&rdquo; she said, and proceeded to the kitchen.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson finished off the lemonade and stared at the empty glass. He noticed that Faith has been acting unusual today. Usually she&rsquo;s sweet and warm, but today she took it to the next level. But it didn&rsquo;t feel like an act, so he couldn&rsquo;t figure out what it was. Suddenly, he sensed a strange aura in the house.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was working in the kitchen and did not notice him slipping into the basement stairs.</p></p>

<p><p>*Creek creek* The wooden floor was old and made a creaking sound with each step. It was completely dark but he didn&rsquo;t bother using a light because he memorized every inch of the basement. He went past the bookshelves to get to the source of the aura. There was a round object under a cloth. He removed the cloth and laid eyes on the Mirrari. The glow of it captivated him, as it did to Faith when she first laid eyes on it. He held it with both hands.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, the entire room flashed. Tyson was startled for a second. The look in his eyes changed...the luster in his eyeballs grew dark and the expression on his face changed. He felt a sudden rush of anger and he went back upstairs with the Mirrari.</p></p>

<p><p>He went into the bedroom and placed the orb on the bed. &ldquo;Faith!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith paused what she was doing and took off her apron and headed to the bedroom. The first thing she saw was Tyson with his arms crossed and he did not look happy. Also the Mirrari was next to him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the meaning of this?&rdquo; he asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You...found it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What is this thing?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She was overwhelmed by guilt and stared at the floor like a child caught in the act. &ldquo;I...I&rsquo;m sorry Tyson.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know...someone handed it to me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me? We&rsquo;re not supposed to keep secrets from each other.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry!&rdquo; Suddenly she just fell down on her knees, which startled him a bit. She placed her arms on his lap and looked up at him with sad eyes. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to hide this from you! I didn&rsquo;t mean to betray you! I&rsquo;m sorry...&rdquo; Then she buried her face into his chest and wrapped her arms around his back, which surprised him. &ldquo;Please forgive me! Don&rsquo;t throw me away!&rdquo; She started sobbing and tears drip down her cheek.</p></p>

<p><p>Even if he was mad, there is no way any sane man can stay mad at her. When she looks at him with those puppy dog eyes, there is no way he can resist that, especially if she is crying and apologizing. Faith is a woman in truest sense - beautiful, feminine and submissive.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson gently placed his arms around her back. He sighed. &ldquo;I forgive you.&rdquo; Faith removed her face from his chest to look up at him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep any more secrets from me ok?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She nodded. He placed a finger on her cheek to wipe the tear drop away.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s pretend this never happened okay?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tyson...&rdquo; Her eyes were shaking as she was looking to his eyes. She was happy that he forgave her so quickly and that he&rsquo;s not going to caste her away.</p></p>

<p><p>Their staring continued without blinking and their face got closer and closer...and they kissed on the lips. The tears continued to drip down her cheeks as they locked lips. Her arms were wrapped around his neck to bring his head lower while his hands wrapped themselves around her back to push her up.</p></p>

<p><p>As his back bent lower and lower, he pushed her onto the floor and he landed on top of her. He kissed her some more and she made faint moans. &ldquo;Mmmmf...mmffff...&rdquo; Her hands grabbed his neck and brushed his hair. He put his face into her neck and started kissing it aggressively. She turned to the side and moaned. &ldquo;Uhhh. Uhhh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He became more turned on when she made these noises. He kept kissing the side of her neck then moved to the front. He wanted to go lower but her blouse was in the way. He ripped off a piece of the blouse, revealing some cleavage. He dipped his face into the cleavage and let himself go.</p></p>

<p><p>They remained on the floor for a while, and Tyson let his instincts take over as he became more turned on. Eventually, their clothes came off and one can imagine what happened after that.</p></p>

<p><p>*Chop* A slice of fish fell on the board as Faith cut the fish. She wanted to make a fantastic meal for the two of them when Tyson gets home. After his daily adventures, he will come home hungry. And when his stomach is full, he&rsquo;ll be hungry for something else.</p></p>

<p><p>The Mirrari continued to lie undisturbed in the basement. Suddenly, it began to glow and its aura spread throughout the house in all directions.</p></p>

<p><p>It has already affected Faith. There were no physical changes and she continued to chop fish as if nothing has happened, but in fact, she has become a completely different person already. She had a flashback of what happened last night.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was on her knees and begging for forgiveness, and they ended up kissing, and then doing it on the floor. She felt used...how dare Tyson manipulate her and treat her like a slave. Her hand clenched the knife tightly in anger. She was angry at herself for acting so weak and allowing that to happen. And she was angry at him for taking advantage of her weakness. The more she thought about it, the more angry she grew...and the bigger the revenge that will come.</p></p>

<p><p>The door slammed open. &ldquo;Honey I&rsquo;m home.&rdquo; said Tyson as he came in. The way he opened the door was too loud, causing her to be annoyed. And for some reason, his voice was annoying. He closed the door behind him and walked over the carpet with his dirty shoes, leaving traces of dirt.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith turned around to look at the carpet, then turned back to her cooking. &ldquo;Honey...&rdquo; she said, holding in her anger. &ldquo;When you enter the house, you have to take off your shoes, otherwise it will stain the carpet. I went over this with you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, sorry.&rdquo; Tyson said, shrugging it off.</p></p>

<p><p>His apology did not make her feel better, in fact, it made her more angry. Not only did he dirty the carpet, but he shrugged it off so casually. He never cleans the carpet and that means she has to clean it...every time.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson sat on the couch and put his legs up on the table and opened a newspaper.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Honey...you never help out with the cooking. It wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to help out once in a while.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But you know I don&rsquo;t cook well. Me helping in the kitchen will only make things worse.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith stopped chopping and clenched the knife tightly in her grasp. Her head was facing down so her face was not seen. &ldquo;So...am I just a household slave to you? You just use me for sex and mundane chores?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson put down the newspaper. &ldquo;You know I don&rsquo;t think that about you. You&rsquo;ve never complained before. What&rsquo;s up all of a sudden?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, she could not hold it in anymore. She threw the knife at the table, hitting the newspaper. *Twang* Tyson was startled. &ldquo;Yikes!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith dashed at him and threw a sidekick, he jumped out of the couch, stumbling back for a few seconds. She pulled the knife from the table and made a stab at him. He dodged thanks to his quick reflexes. She continued to stab him, make swipes from the side and up and down. *Whoosh whoosh*</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson caught her hand with both his palms. &ldquo;Faith, what&rsquo;s gotten into you?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How dare you take advantage of me! You tricked me!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What are you saying?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith got free from his grip and continued to slash at him. Her movements were fast and precise, and it took all he had just to dodge. Suddenly, she kicked him in the stomach and he fell down. *Wham*</p></p>

<p><p>She threw the knife at the door and ran away.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s gotten into her?&rdquo; Tyson ran towards the basement, the place where she headed to. Suddenly, he heard glass break. Then he ran outside. Faith flew away, carrying the Mirrari under her arms.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Faith! Come back!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula opened the door without knocking. &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s finally happened. You pissed her off so much that she ran away from home.&rdquo; Then the look on his face became one of confusion as Tyson was focused on something.</p></p>

<p><p>On the coffee table laid tons of small pieces of paper.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;These are lottery tickets.&rdquo; Tyson replied. He was not speaking in his usual manner. He had dark circles under his eyes and his eyes have lost its luster. &ldquo;I bought as many as I can. With these I&rsquo;ll be rich! Rich! Hahahaha!&rdquo; He threw the tickets in air and made it rain lottery tickets.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Uhh...what about Faith running away?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That woman? Who cares about her?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who cares? Tyson, what&rsquo;s gotten into you? She&rsquo;s the love of your life?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That woman decided to leave me. Forget about her! Money is all that matters!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula was no longer confused, but outraged. He slammed his hand on the table. &ldquo;Are you listening to yourself right now?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson hogged all the tickets into his arms and glared at Nebula like gollum holding onto his precious. &ldquo;I know what this is about. These tickets are mine and you can&rsquo;t have them!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Soldiers at the front gate noticed a woman coming towards them. As she came closer, they recognized her right away. &ldquo;Princess. We weren&rsquo;t expecting you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She had a blank expression on her face. &ldquo;Is that all? Is that all you&rsquo;re going to say to the royal princess of the entire kingdom? Huh?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The soldiers glanced at each other and glanced at her. She&rsquo;s always been a cheerful and friendly person, but today, her mannerisms and words confused them.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m standing here before you and you&rsquo;re not going to kneel? Isn&rsquo;t that rude?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Both soldiers kneeled immediately. &ldquo;Sorry princess.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith walked past them. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s better. Next time, do it without me telling you to.&rdquo; She walked into the gate.</p></p>

<p><p>Squire was watching from the second floor window.</p></p>

<p><p>Inside a hallway of the palace, the princess was seen talking to a servant. &ldquo;Where is my father?&rdquo; she asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The king is away on urgent business.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Urgent business? Ridiculous. What can be more urgent than seeing your own daughter?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The servant bowed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure his highness will be back anytime.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Whatever.&rdquo; Faith replied. &ldquo;Go back to your job.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The servant turned around and walked away.</p></p>

<p><p>Squire showed up. &ldquo;Princess.&rdquo;<br>  &ldquo;Oh hey Squire. What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like you to come back unannounced.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith grew annoyed. &ldquo;So I have to announce when I come back to my <strong>own</strong> home?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not what I meant. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting you, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Is that all you have to say to me?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Princess...did something happen while you were at the other dimension? You seem different.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean?&rdquo;<br>  Squire glanced at the Mirrari. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; she replied.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me that&rsquo;s the Mirrari? How did you come into possession of it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;None of your business.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Princess, it&rsquo;s likely that the Mirrari has affected your personality. It&rsquo;s a cursed item that has caused the downfall of many dynasties in the past. You shouldn&rsquo;t be holding onto such a dangerous item.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Listen, don&rsquo;t stick your nose into something that doesn&rsquo;t concern you. Go back to your duties, Squire.&rdquo; With that said, Faith walked away from him.</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="b">[ B ] - The Princess Returns Home </span></p></center>

<p><p>Bossing people around all day made her tired and sleepy. She lay down on her bed and fell soundly asleep. The Mirrari was placed under her bed so no one would find it. The cursed jewel has a mind of its own and it glowed. This time, its effect spread throughout the entire palace. Not only was Faith affected, but all the soldiers as well as Squire.</p></p>

<p><p>Meanwhile, just outside the palace, three silhouetted figures appeared from the shadows. Behind them was their leader, a powerful sorcerer named <strong>Rubeus</strong>. And starting from the left, the three henchmen were - <strong>Arkady</strong>, an expert archer. <strong>Ren</strong>, a street fighter who releases a massive amount of energy in his attacks. And <strong>Cruton</strong>, a sorcerer who wore a white vest.</p></p>

<p><p>Ren: &ldquo;Are are you sure the Mirrari is here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, there is no doubt about it. I can sense it&rsquo;s presence. And I do not sense the princess or any of her companions, so it&rsquo;s safe to invade now.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady: &ldquo;I wonder if it&rsquo;ll be easy like last time?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Cruton: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s guarded by a bunch of ground soldiers, we&rsquo;ll make short work of them.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> The soldiers at the gate drew their spears. &ldquo;Stop, who goes there?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Rubeus!&rdquo; The two soldiers charged at the enemy.</p></p>

<p><p>Ren charged up ki into his fist and punched the ground, making a shockwave that targeted the ground the soldiers stood on. *Kabam* The ground shattered and the soldiers were knocked away.</p></p>

<p><p>Ren fired a projectile at the gate, destroying the middle of it, and consequently causing the gate to open.</p></p>

<p><p> The sound of the gate breaking caused all the soldiers to be alert. One of them blew a horn, alerting all the guards in the palace. All the guards in the backyard unsheathe their swords and charged at their target. Rubeus was completely relaxed. In fact, he let his henchmen do all the work while he didn&rsquo;t have to lift a finger.</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady loaded up three arrows at once and put his ki into them. Cruton made a hand jutsu and suddenly, flames appeared around three of the guards. They screamed in agony as they were burned alive. An arrow hit each of them in the heart, killing them instantly.</p></p>

<p><p> In another part of the front yard Ren pounded his fists and waited for the guards to get close to him. He used melee attacks to beat the guards into a bloody pulp. Bodies flew all over the place.</p></p>

<p><p>In no time at all, the front yard was full of injured and dead bodies. Rubeus predicted that he didn&rsquo;t have to lift a finger and he was right. Him and his three loyal henchmen proceeded to enter the palace doors.</p></p>

<p><p>Inside the palace, the main room was one with a large fountain. Another group of guards had their weapons already drawn and ready to fight. But they were nervous, having heard of Rubeus&rsquo;s name...they know of his terrible reputation. One of the guards burst into the palace. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all killed...in a matter of minutes!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Two of the squad leaders looked at each other. &ldquo;What do we do now? Do we fight...?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t possibly win against a sorcerer of that level. We&rsquo;d just be throwing our lives away.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Then...what? Do we betray the king?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> Rubeus and his three henchmen came past the entrance. Ren cracked his knuckles. &ldquo;So, when do you want to get started.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>To his surprise, the guards bowed down and placed their weapons on the floor. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurt us. We surrender...we swear loyalty to you, Rubeus.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus was surprised at this turn of events. But things turned out to be convenient for him. He stepped in front of his henchmen. &ldquo;Are you willing to betray the king to serve me?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Guard: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just paid soldiers. We value our lives, we have families to take care of!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Very well then. Your lives will be spared as long as you do my bidding.&rdquo; Then turned to his henchmen. &ldquo;See how fickle humans are? They have no loyalties...they only serve whoever is victorious. Now, search the entire palace and eliminate anyone that gets in your way.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The three henchmen placed their arms over their chest. &ldquo;Yes sir!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> One of the palace servants was an old man that was slightly hunched over. He knocked on the door to the princess&rsquo;s chambers. *Knock knock* He peered in. &ldquo;Princess!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She was in bed and woke up.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sorry to disturb you.&rdquo; He said nervously. &ldquo;But there are intruders...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Intruders?&rdquo; She put her feet on the floor and was now sitting on the bed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Rubeus...he&rsquo;s taken over the palace!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Rubeus? Take me to him...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p> <p><a name=&quot;MidAir&quot;></a>Stripped in Mid-Air</p></p>

<p> <p>Faith pushed the door open slowly, making a creek sound. She was half hiding behind the door.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Come in.&rdquo; Rubeus had his back facing her.</p></p>

<p><p>She closed the door behind her and walked forward.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus turned around. &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s you, princess?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Rubeus...&rdquo; She was nervous, and instinctively placed her hand over her breast.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Have you come to foil my plans as usual?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I must warn you, my spells have become more powerful since we last met.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I d-don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re planning, but...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus noticed that Faith&rsquo;s behavior is peculiar. Her body language is one of a shy, nervous girl, who is unable to make eye contact. Usually, she&rsquo;d stare at him with those fierce eyes of hers and she&rsquo;d point her sword at him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t plan on fighting you.&rdquo; she said.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; Rubeus asked, raising his eyebrows.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to fight you...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Even though I wish to claim this palace for myself? This is your home, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I know how powerful you are...&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I know...that I&rsquo;m no match for you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What are you plotting, exactly?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I came here to surrender.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What? You can&rsquo;t trick me. I won&rsquo;t be fooled that easily.&rdquo; Rubeus then realized what it could be. (Wait! Could the Mirari have done this? Legend has it that the Mirari can cause people to change personalities, causing them to be the complete opposite of what they used to be. Still, I have to make sure.) &ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Y-yes.&rdquo; Faith replied meekly. Her eyes were shaking and she stared at the floor. &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s pointless to fight you...so...I...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come to submit to me, yes?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Uhhh...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a wise decision. So, even you the princess, know when to give up. You chose life over a futile struggle followed by a painful death.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I give up my life to you...you can use me as a servant if you want...I d-don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus smiled. He opened his palm and shot an energy ball at her left shoulder. *Bam*</p></p>

<p><p>She screamed in pain and stumbled backwards. &ldquo;Uuuuh!&rdquo; Pieces of her dress were torn. She put her hand over her wound and stood limply.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus was surprised she let the energy ball hit her. He thought she&rsquo;d either block it or dodge it instead of letting her body take the damage.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith remained still and just stared at him with sad eyes. For some reason, Rubeus got annoyed at her. He still thought that this was an act. And if it is an act, it&rsquo;s going too far. He shot another energy ball at her right shoulder. *Bam*</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Uuuugh!&rdquo; She fell backwards.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus was more surprised. Now he was convinced this is no act. There is no reason for anyone to let themselves get hurt unless if they&rsquo;ve given up. He is certain that she will not retaliate no matter what...Perhaps the Mirrari has changed her for good. In that case, he is going to have a little fun with her.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was lying on the ground and trembling from the pain. To take a direct hit like that caused some damage on her body. She panted for breath as she pushed herself off the floor with her arms. Even such a small motion took a lot of strength, considering her injuries. She was moaning with each movement and Rubeus enjoyed the noises she was making.</p></p>

<p><p>She got on her hands and knees, panting for breath. When her breathing calmed she looked up at him with sad eyes. She put her hand over her shoulder injured shoulder. &ldquo;M-Master, did I do something to upset you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus shot another energy ball at the defenseless woman, hitting her in the breasts and knocking her backwards. <strong>*Thud*</strong></p></p>

<p><p>Faith was lying on the floor face up, semi-conscious and moaning from the pain. She was still injured from taking the first two hits, and to take another hit hurt her even more. She panted for breath, trying to get herself off the floor.</p></p>

<p><p>She turned over so she&rsquo;s facing the floor, lifting her torso up with her arms. She managed to crawl on her knees. She&rsquo;s panting for breath the whole time. She then pushed herself off the floor with her hands, and bent her legs so she can stand. She managed to stand on her feet, but limply, like an injured person would. She had one hand over her left arm.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if I&rsquo;ve angered you, master...I&rsquo;m here to serve you...You c-can ask me to do anything...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus leered at her starting from the bottom to the top. &ldquo;Anything?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Y-yes, anything.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I see. Now, as your new master, I give you your first command. I want you to strip.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith gasped and her eyes opened wide. &ldquo;W-what?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You heard me. Strip naked now.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;B-but...I...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You said you&rsquo;d do anything, right? Or was that a lie?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Anything but that. Please!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus walked over to her. She closed her eyes, wincing as he passed by. But he walked past her and got behind her.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus put his hands on her shoulders and smelled her hair. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my servant now and that means you&rsquo;re my property. You and your body belong to me now.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Then he put his hands on her breasts and squeezed them. &ldquo;Ugh! Uuugh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Your body is now mine.&rdquo; he whispered into her ear. &ldquo;Understand?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She tried to get away, Rubeus grabbed her left wrist, forcing her to turn around. His free hand grabbed her by the back and pulled her into him, and he forced his lips onto hers. &ldquo;MMMMFFFFFF!!!&rdquo; She was weak and helpless and did virtually nothing to resist. She could no longer hold back the tears as they streamed down her cheek.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus enjoyed the kiss and made it last as long as he could hold his breath. Her lips were soft and sweet and wet. It was not just the physical sensation he felt. He could tell that she was submissive and given up hope just from the kiss. A woman&rsquo;s lips tastes better when she&rsquo;s submitted to you. Her movements were different and the noises she made were different. It was the taste of victory and complete dominance.</p></p>

<p><p>When he finally released her lips, he shoved her away.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmph. If you won&rsquo;t take your clothes off, I&rsquo;ll take them off for you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus used his Freeze spell. <strong>*Zap*</strong> His eyes glowed and she cannot move a muscle. Her body was frozen in place.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus lifted Faith up with his spell and she was helpless in the air.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now, let me take those clothes off for you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A bunch of scissors flew from the table towards her. One of them went to her breasts and started cutting the shoulder straps. Faith gasped.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus can control many things at the same time. His powers have advanced this much.</p></p>

<p><p>The second scissor was cutting the incision on her leg. It cut all the way to her hip.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Stop, please! Stop!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Then Rubeus got tired of waiting. He tossed all the scissors aside. Rubeus concentrated really hard. Faith&rsquo;s dress ripped itself off in one pull, in many pieces. Pieces of fabric scattered.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aaaahhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>In an instant, she&rsquo;s naked, everything&rsquo;s exposed to this villain. And she&rsquo;s floating in mid air.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus waved his hand, and consequently Faith&rsquo;s body turned horizontal, and floated inside the bed chambers. She fell and landed on the mattress. *Plop*</p></p>

<p><p>He walked towards the bed while she remained still. Perhaps the spell disabled her movements or maybe she has no will to fight back at all. Even if she tried, it would be of no use, only a futile struggle. Faith&rsquo;s will was already weak to begin with...but now she was injured physically and mentally, and thus her will is virtually gone.</p></p>

<p><p>It is just as she predicted, Rubeus is too powerful for someone like her to deal with. Fighting back is pointless because, after all, she already surrendered.</p></p>

<p><p> Rubeus was now standing directly in front of her. This was the moment that she has been dreading since the beginning...ever since he stripped her naked and threw her on the bed, she had a feeling of what was going to happen...and it&rsquo;s not going to be pleasant. He grabbed her left ankle and lifted up her leg and placed it next to his cheek. He rubbed his cheek against her ankle, feeling her skin with his skin. He kissed her ankle slowly and gently, treating her body like a rare delicatessen. He made successive kisses on her shin, slowly moving his lips towards her knee.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith did not move a muscle as he did what he pleased with her leg. She has already submitted to him as a servant, and this is a servant&rsquo;s job, isn&rsquo;t it? It&rsquo;s the servant&rsquo;s job to let her master do whatever he pleases with her body. And she has no right to complain...it is not her place to do so. Someone as powerful as Rubeus can have her killed...or even worse, tortured to death. Enduring this humiliation is better than being tortured to death...isn&rsquo;t it?</p></p>

<p><p>His lips have made their way to her knee, and continued a straight path to her thigh. He made sure to kiss her leg slowly, not missing even an inch of her skin.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s head turned to the side, staring at nothingness. It was uncomfortable having a man who&rsquo;s not her lover touching her like this. It was humiliating and discomforting. But despite her pain, she must endure it no matter what.</p></p>

<p><p>He placed her leg down, and continued to kiss her inner thighs. It would only be a matter of seconds before his face reaches their final destination... He put his face into her sacred area and just let himself loose...he kissed and chewed on it like a hungry beggar eating food for the first time in weeks.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith, who had been silent and lifeless up till now, groaned out loud. Her head tossed and turned, wincing from the agony. There was nothing that could have prepared her for this. There&rsquo;s no woman who can be mentally ready to be physically violated like this. Her fingers squeezed the bed sheet, and her head turned to the side. Those were the only movements she could make at this point.</p></p>

<p><p>Looking from outside the bed, one can see this act of debauchery through the curtains. The silhouetted figure of the woman was lying down, and there&rsquo;s a silhouetted man on top of her, and his face was inside her hips.</p></p>

<p><p>This is for the best, isn&rsquo;t it? She sacrificed her body so that Rubeus is happy. And if he&rsquo;s happy, she gets to live to see another day. Fighting back is useless...there&rsquo;s no way she&rsquo;s a match for him...Rubeus is too strong. She doesn&rsquo;t even have the will to fight anymore. Whatever spirit she had is gone.</p></p>

<p><p>He then moved his face to her stomach. He caressed her skin gently with his lips, and at the same time, smelling her with his nose. Her skin tasted good so he did it slowly, making successive kisses while moving up her stomach.</p></p>

<p><p>And his face landed on her breasts. Rubeus just let himself loose, snuggling her breasts like pillows. He kissed them all over and put his face in between them and just enjoyed himself.</p></p>

<p><p>Her fingers squeezed the bed sheet while tears streamed down her eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>Without any will left, all she can do is cry silently as this man is about to take everything away from her. She had no strength left, all she can do is squeeze the bed with her fingers.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith has already surrendered and proclaimed herself to be his servant. And a woman must keep her word, right? It&rsquo;s not wrong to recognize your own weakness, isn&rsquo;t it? Whether it&rsquo;s wrong or not, it is too late. Her situation has already been decided. She was stripped of not just her clothes, but everything she held dear.</p></p>

<p><p>Whatever pleasure he is experiencing, she is experience 1000 times the pain and suffering.</p></p>

<p><p>There&rsquo;s no way out of this situation...unless if someone were to...no, no one can rescue her now. She did betray Tyson after all. This must be her punishment for betrayal, right?</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus sucked on her breasts without a care in the world. Her head turned to the side and the tears continued to flow down her face. She cursed her own weak existence...maybe this is the fate of a woman...the fate of someone who is a coward.</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="c">[ C ] - The Puppet Master </span></p></center>

<p><p>Squire entered the princess&rsquo;s room, checking to make sure she&rsquo;s not here. Normally, he would not intrude into her room like this, but the Mirrari&rsquo;s effect has affected him too. He looked under the bed and found the glowing orb. Just like anyone else who&rsquo;s held the Mirrari before him, he was mesmerized by it&rsquo;s glow.</p></p>

<p><p>Much like what happened to Tyson, Squire became extremely greedy and only cared about money. He no longer cared about his loyalty to the king or the princess. In his private room, gold coins started to pile up. He told his men to start collecting protection fees from citizens. The fees started to add up and fill up the room with gold coins. On the table was a pile of coins. He grabbed them in his hands and let them fall off his fingers. &ldquo;Yes...I&rsquo;m rich! I am the richest man in the kingdom! Hahaha.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>One of his men decided to speak up. &ldquo;Squire...what about the palace? Rubeus has taken the princess hostage.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I told you - I don&rsquo;t give a damn about any of them. I only care about money.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But this isn&rsquo;t like you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; Squire snapped at him. &ldquo;What are you doing here? Go out and collect more fees!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The man realized it was pointless to argue with him, lest he would get yelled at more. He nodded and left the room.</p></p>

<p> <p><a name=&quot;LikeAPuppet&quot;></a>Like A Puppet</p></p>

<p> <p>Faith backed away until her back hit the bed pillar. She feared for her life, her arm covering her breasts, her legs shaking, her knees were touching.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus used the freeze spell on her, making Faith unable to move. Now she awaited her fate. Rubeus made a motion with his fingers, causing Faith&rsquo;s arms to lift up. While under the spell, he can control her body&rsquo;s movements like a puppet. It&rsquo;s as if her limbs were tied up by invisible strings, and he controls those strings. Her arms were spread sideways.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus then waved his right hand. The loose ribbon on her body flew towards him and he grabbed it. He smiled. Faith knew what he was planning to do, but she cannot do anything to stop it.</p></p>

<p><p>He pulled the ribbon off her body, and she was spinning like a top. Faith screamed as she was being stripped naked. Rubeus pulled for a good ten seconds, and finally all the ribbons came off her.</p></p>

<p><p>He leered at her nude form for a good while. This was the perfect spot to see everything. Faith just stood there, completely humiliated, and completely shocked. She couldn&rsquo;t even utter a sound, all she did was pant for breath.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus walked up to her until they were face to face, and Faith breathed harder, and her pupils dilated. He leaned in close and kissed her lips. He wrapped his arms around her back and leaned forward, forcing her to lean back a little. With her not able to move, he did as he pleased. While tasting her lips, he opened his mouth, forcing her mouth to open.</p></p>

<p><p>Poor Faith stood there while he violated her lips. Her arms hung at the hips. Her fingers twitched a little, but other than that, she could not move.</p></p>

<p><p>Then Rubeus put his face into her neck and kissed it, and kissed her cleavage, causing her to moan. As he continued to violate her while embracing her body, they began to float up. They floated several inches above the ground, then a few feet. Rubeus did not stop even for a second, he continued to violate the poor woman as they floated.</p></p>

<p><p>Then their bodies turned horizontal, and slowly drifted towards the center of the bed. Rubeus put his face in her breasts and kissed it all over.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith groaned and moaned, her head turning left and right. &ldquo;Ahhh! Ugh!! Aaah!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus can enjoy himself and use spells at the same time - for him it&rsquo;s completely natural. He has never done it in mid-air before, so it is kind of a thrill. He is more turned on than before.</p></p>

<p><p>Poor Faith continued to suffer as she screamed and tossed her head. Being in mid-air is uncomfortable. There&rsquo;s nothing under her body but air, and it feels unnatural and dangerous. Not only that, but there is a man on top of her, which makes it even heavier. But she did not even have time to process the fear and discomfort, as Rubeus violated her every single second.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, they dropped on the bed. *Plop!*</p></p>

<p><p>She screamed from the drop. Luckily, the bed was soft and she wasn&rsquo;t hurt. But having a man&rsquo;s body on top of her made the fall painful.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus&rsquo;s face landed in her breasts, just the way he wanted it. How convenient it is for him, since he&rsquo;s in the perfect position to do whatever he wants. After the drop, he paused for a few seconds, and continued where he left off. Now that they&rsquo;re on the bed, he can go all out and have his way with her completely.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s eyes were half open the whole time. She screamed as he ravaged her without holding back one bit. &ldquo;Ugh! Ahh! Ugh!&rdquo; The poor woman had no idea what was happening the whole time. Too many things happened too fast. She&rsquo;s not even sure if she&rsquo;s conscious or not, or maybe this whole thing is a dream. But it is too painful to be a dream.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus let himself loose. Her fingers squeezed the bed sheet, and her legs kicked a little. Her head tossed left and right, and she screamed in agony. It was over before it even began...Faith was helpless and couldn&rsquo;t do a thing. She&rsquo;s no different than a puppet before Rubeus. Or rather, a lamb for the slaughter. She&rsquo;s going to lose everything without even a chance to resist...</p></p>

<p><p>Macintosh was bored today so he went on his computer to google the term Mirrari. He clicked on the first link on the results page and the browser window opened an article page about the Mirrari. As he read the contents his eyes began to widen.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula and Zelfire flew in the lab from the window. &ldquo;What is it Mac? It sounded pretty urgent.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mac: &ldquo;Guys, this is about the Mirrari.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zell: &ldquo;You know something about it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Neb: &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it just some royal treasure that&rsquo;s been passed down the Midas family?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mac: &ldquo;No...that&rsquo;s what Faith told you. It&rsquo;s not something passed down from the Midas family and it&rsquo;s not treasure. It&rsquo;s more like a curse.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zell and Neb glanced at each other.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This curse explains Tyson and Faith&rsquo;s odd behavior as of late. The Mirrari is a cursed jewel that has caused nothing but calamity throughout history. Royal families think that it&rsquo;s a sacred treasure, being lured in by it&rsquo;s glow. It changes people&rsquo;s personalities - for better or for worse. It has torn royal families apart, causing them to betray and kill each other, destroying entire dynasties in the process. &rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Neb: &ldquo;Are you saying that Tyson&rsquo;s odd behavior is because of this curse?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mac: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only explanation.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;LongLiveKing&quot;></a>Long Live the King</p></p>

<p> <p>Rubeus was sitting on the throne chair, wearing a crown. He sat crossed legged and his arms lay on the armrest.</p></p>

<p><p>He has been playing king all day. And now he&rsquo;s bored.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith came into the room. &ldquo;Master...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh? Did you finish your chores?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith walked up the red carpet and stood in front of Rubeus and the throne chair. Her right hand was holding her left wrist, she was staring at the floor nervously. &ldquo;Yes sir...I cleaned the bedroom and made dinner, just as you told me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know it&rsquo;s rude to stand before the king?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Immediately, Faith got on her knees. &ldquo;Sorry, my lord.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus was not pleased, however. He waved his fingers, using the puppet spell to control her body. He made her lower her head all the way to the floor. &ldquo;Ah, much better. That&rsquo;s more like it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith just stayed there, not moving and staring at the floor.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I make a much better king than your father, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Poor Faith has no choice but to put up with these insults. Everyday she is abused sexually and physically, forced to do physical labor, and on top of that, she has to take these insults without talking back.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now come over here.&rdquo; Rubeus made her look forward. She was forced to stand up, and then slowly walk over to him. Every movement she took was not of her own free will, but of someone else&rsquo;s will. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good girl.&rdquo; he said.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was now standing before him. She bent down and put her hands on the armrest, hovering over him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Good...a slave must serve her king.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He grabbed one of her breasts and squeezed it. She moaned while shutting her eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ugh...ughhh...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>It was uncomfortable. Her arms were trembling as he violated her. Suddenly, he grabbed her torso and pulled her and she fell forward. Her head fell against his shoulder, and she was facing the chair. They were hugging and cheek to cheek. He could smell her. She smelled good.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly Rubeus grabbed her torso and turned her body over horizontally. Her back rested on his right arm and her legs rested on his left arm. He leaned in and forced his lips into hers. He became aggressive and did not hold back against this poor girl. Sitting in the king&rsquo;s chair and playing king makes him feel powerful. And nothing says power like screwing a woman in his arms.</p></p>

<p><p>He completely swallowed her lips and her head was being pushed down. He wanted to enjoy this to the fullest. The poor girl was semi-conscious and her eyes were shut. She could not even move a muscle. Her limbs twitched.</p></p>

<p><p>Tears drip down her eyes and fell to the carpet.</p></p>

<p><p>He finally released the kiss to take a breath, but he was not done. He moved his lips to her chin, then sensually kissed her neck and her cleavage. She moaned. His left hand touched her thigh and moved up and down.</p></p>

<p><p>When he grew bored of screwing her in that position, he tossed her on the floor. *Thud*</p></p>

<p><p>The poor girl was being treated like cargo. He got off the chair and lied down on top of her, and continued to violate her. Faith moaned and groaned in agony. From behind the chair, one can see her head, while the rest of her body was hidden. Her head was tossing and turning in discomfort, while she let out painful moans. Her fingers grabbed the carpet.</p></p>

<p><p>Back at home, Tyson squeezed the lottery tickets in his hand, still obsessing over being rich. &ldquo;All the fortunes will be mine!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>But in an instant, his eyes returned to normal and he snapped out of his neurotic behavior. He felt stupid holding onto these tickets. His memories were still intact, but he couldn&rsquo;t believe what he had done. &ldquo;What is all this? What have I been doing all this time?&rdquo; Suddenly, he remembered something Nebula said to him. Faith had gone back to her dimension. He needs to get her back asap.</p></p>

<p><p>Without wasting any more time, he called up the others: Nebula, Macintosh and Zelfire. There was a critical situation on their hands - Faith has the Mirarri and it&rsquo;s a cursed jewel. If left alone, who knows what will happen?</p></p>

<p><p>Mac brought them to the dimensional pod and they went to the parallel dimension.</p></p>

<p> <p><a name=&quot;TheTango&quot;></a>The Tango</p></p>

<p> <p>Faith backed up against the bed, her arms crossed over her breasts. She feared for her life. After all the hell she&rsquo;s been through, who knows what else he&rsquo;s planning to do to her...</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus just stood there, with a grin on his face. He made a gesture with his right arm. A violin floated up from the floor into the air. Two more violins floated up from the background. They started to play themselves. His spell has become more advanced and now he can move multiple objects at once. The violins played tango music.</p></p>

<p><p>Then he stared at Faith and his eyes glowed white. Her body was now under his control. Her arms dropped to the side of her hips and she walked towards him slowly. At the same time, Rubeus walked towards her.</p></p>

<p><p>Her eyes were shaking from fear... She was practically naked, wearing only thin ribbons...and she&rsquo;s at his complete mercy. Rubeus was not only a demon, but a cold-blooded murderer, and completely unpredictable. There&rsquo;s no telling what this madman is thinking and what he will do next.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Shall we dance, princess?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>They held hands and their bodies started to move in tune with each other&rsquo;s. Faith has no control over her body whatsoever under his spell. Rubeus can make her do whatever his will desires...and he was in the mood for doing the tango.</p></p>

<p><p> Their feet moved in sync with each other&rsquo;s - moving left, then right, then back and forth. They were face to face, and Faith was frightened the whole time. She just stared at him with big, frightful eyes. The only thing she can control was her emotions and her facial expressions. Even if she can still talk, she was speechless as she was overcome by fear.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, her body was pressed into his body as if embracing. He held one of her hands while his other hand held her back. They were now cheek to cheek while still dancing in a box. Rubeus smelled her hair and sighed. &ldquo;You look beautiful tonight.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Those words sent chills down her spine. It&rsquo;s not something you&rsquo;d expect from the enemy...but Rubeus is making her tango with him...as if he&rsquo;s seducing her. There&rsquo;s something terribly wrong with this scenario... terribly wrong. He is holding her hands like a lover would, and embracing her like a lover would, and even whispering sweet nothings into her ear.</p></p>

<p><p>He turned his head slightly and smelled her neck and at the same time his lips touched the skin on her neck. He was smelling her and tasting her at the same time. He lowered his face slightly and kissed her shoulder.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was very uncomfortable...Her body was pressed against his body entirely from top to bottom...and he was smelling her and kissing her. It wasn&rsquo;t just uncomfortable physically...but in many ways. Rubeus is the enemy and yet they&rsquo;re dancing the tango, an activity that is meant for lovers.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus&rsquo;s left hand slid down her back, but his right hand continued to hold her left hand. Their feet were moving the whole time, not stopping for anything.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;P-Please stop this...&rdquo; Faith mumbled. <a name=&quot;Dance_face_breasts&quot;></a></p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Rubeus lowered her torso so her body was bending backwards. His right hand lifted up her left leg, and consequently her leg was completely horizontal. Only her right foot was on the ground. Even without the puppet spell, she was completely helpless in this position. Rubeus bended his torso forward, and he buried his face into her breasts.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith moaned in pain. Her head was dangling off her neck, and everything she saw was upside down. His right hand rubbed her thigh from top to bottom and bottom to top. His hand liked the texture of her thigh, it felt smooth like the surface of a table, but soft like a pillow.</p></p>

<p><p>The only thing between his face and her breasts were thin layers of ribbons. They were so thin it was inconsequential, it&rsquo;s as if he&rsquo;s feeling her bare breasts. They were so soft and bouncy and he wanted to stay like this all day long. <a name=&quot;Dance_kiss_lips&quot;></a></p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus then lifted her torso up and let go of her leg so she could stand up straight. They stared face to face for a brief moment and Faith gasped. She was in constant fear the entire time, not having any control over herself and basically being this man&rsquo;s sex object. But she&rsquo;s especially afraid when staring at him directly in the face...her pupils dilate and her throat dries up. It&rsquo;s not just her body, it&rsquo;s as if he&rsquo;s violating her very soul.</p></p>

<p><p>This was the moment he&rsquo;s been waiting for. His hands held her back and he pulled her in and kissed her lips. His eyes were closed as he enjoyed the kiss. &ldquo;Mmmmffff!&rdquo; Faith&rsquo;s eyes were wide open with shock and she was on the verge of tears. Even though she knew this was coming, there&rsquo;s no way she could prepare for something like this...ever. She&rsquo;s a dignified princess of a kingdom and should be treated like a lady. But Rubeus treats her as nothing more than a piece of meat. This dance is nothing but an excuse to violate and molest her in every possible way. So far, this was the most uncomfortable thing he&rsquo;s doing to her, she can&rsquo;t see anything or breath. Even though the kiss was a few seconds, to her it felt like an eternity.</p></p>

<p><p>After he was done with the lip lock, they resumed dancing as before. Their feet moved back and forth. She was worried every single moment, knowing it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before he molests her again. &ldquo;Stop this...please!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus&rsquo;s knees were slightly bent, and Faith&rsquo;s right leg intertwined with his left leg, and her left leg was between his legs. He dragged her backwards and their two bodies moved as one across the floor. <a name=&quot;Dance_tango_spin&quot;></a></p></p>

<p><p>While holding hands, he raised his arm vertically, raising her arm at the same time, causing her to spin into him. It was a classic tango move, and it was flawlessly executed, considering that Rubeus was controlling her every move. Her back was pressed against his torso, while his right hand held her right hand firmly, pressing it against her breasts. His left hand was grabbing her left hand as her hand grabbed the ribbons on her stomach.</p></p>

<p><p>He smelled her hair and sighed. &ldquo;You smell good.&rdquo; He proceeded to place his lips on her shoulder, kissing them slowly and softly. He made successive kisses towards her neck. She was wincing and turned away from him. &ldquo;Uhhh...uhhh...&rdquo; Each time he did something to her she made a whimpering noise.</p></p>

<p><p>He kissed her neck while moving his lips towards her face. Faith&rsquo;s head turned all the way to the other side while her eyes were squinting. &ldquo;Uhhh...uhhh...&rdquo; <a name=&quot;Dance_kiss_hand&quot;></a></p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Rubeus lowered her torso so that she was horizontal. His right arm was holding onto her while his other hand was holding her left hand in front of his face.</p></p>

<p><p>He kissed the back of her hand as if he&rsquo;s a gentleman greeting a woman. Her hand was soft and creamy, and it tastes different than other parts of her body.</p></p>

<p><p>He kissed her wrist and moved his lips down her forearm. Even if music was playing, each kiss was loud and was clearly audible. <a name=&quot;Dance_lower_kiss&quot;></a></p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, he jerked her hand and pulled her shoulder, forcing her torso to move up. He moved down to meet her face. They were face to face again, and her was the same, fearful and helpless. He forced his lips into hers.</p></p>

<p><p>He closed his eyes to enjoy it fully. His mouth was open and tasted her lips.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mmmmmfffff!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He was so aggressive that his head was pushing her head lower.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith not only had to deal with the physical pain, but the psychological pain as well. This was humiliating for her, but for Rubeus this is just a game. Her head was dangling off her neck and upside down. She couldn&rsquo;t see anything but the wall.</p></p>

<p><p>He raised her torso up and made her stand straight. They resumed dancing. He raised her arm up and made her spin a few times, and her back was pressed into his body. Her arms were raised up. His hands held her hands, then slowly slid down her wrist, then her forearms. He was feeling the texture of her skin. He touched her triceps and down her underarms. Then his hands grabbed her breasts and squeezed them. Faith moaned in pain.</p></p>

<p><p>He squeezed her breasts while he smelled her hair. Then his left hand slid down her stomach and to her hip, down to her thigh, and into the ribbons. She groaned even louder.</p></p>

<p><p>When he was done with that, he held her hand and spins her until they were face to face. They continued to tango like normal.</p></p>

<p><p>They were spinning round and round clockwise. Then he slammed her against the wall, causing her to moan slightly. &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He pressed her wrists against the wall and they were so close their noses were almost touching. He can feel her breath, they were rapid and loud, because she was scared for her life. Who can blame her, considering all the torture and harassment that Rubeus put her through so far?</p></p>

<p><p>Of course, the next thing he did was lean in and went for her lips. This time he was more aggressive than before.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;MMMMMFFFF!!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>With the wall as support, he could do more with his lips...he swallowed her lips whole by opening and closing his mouth. He made it last as long as possible, savoring every second and every inch of her lips. It&rsquo;s as if his lips were magnetically drawn to her lips...he tried to kiss her at every opportunity.</p></p>

<p><p>When he grew bored of that, he lowered himself and went for her neck. The front of her neck was so soft and tender, it tastes like the skin on other parts of her body, yet it tasted different. She winced while turning her head the other way. &ldquo;Ughhhh, ughhhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He shoved his face between her breasts. Half of them were covered by ribbons while the half was exposed. Rubeus&rsquo;s mouth was in the ribbons, while his nose touched her exposed skin. He kissed her skin while turning his head back and forth to enjoy her breasts full. They felt so soft and bouncy against his face and for him, it was heaven. He could have stayed like this all day, but he must control his urges, for he has a dance to complete.</p></p>

<p><p>His right hand grabbed her thigh and lifted up her leg against his hips.</p></p>

<p><p>Then they resumed the tango. &ldquo;Please...stop...please!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He lowered her torso just like before, and her head was upside down. His hand lifted her leg up. He lifted her leg even higher and put it on his shoulder. He and kissed her ankle and her shin.</p></p>

<p><p>They resumed dancing, moving along with the music. Suddenly, he pulled her close and kissed her lips. Unlike the other kisses, this one was quicker. He stopped the kiss and stared at her in the eyes. Her eyes were shaking and on the verge of tears. <a name=&quot;Dance_strip_dance&quot;></a></p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;And now, the strip dance...&rdquo; he said in almost a whisper.</p></p>

<p><p>Before she even had time to react, he grabbed the loose ribbon and pulled it hard. It caused her to spin away from him. &ldquo;Ahhh...ahhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus kept on pulling until there was nothing left to pull. The ribbons all dropped to the floor, and she stood in front of him stark naked. Faith was beyond embarrassed to be standing in front of this villain completely exposed, and he could see everything. One can see the lust in his eyes as he stared at her naked body without even blinking.</p></p>

<p><p>She watched like a deer in headlights as he walked up to her. Not only could she not move, but now she can&rsquo;t even speak because of the fear. Her eyes were shaking and on the verge of tears. <a name=&quot;Dance_naked_dance&quot;></a></p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;And now, the naked dance...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s arms moved by themselves, and joined hands with Rubeus. They resumed dancing like before.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, please! Please stop!&rdquo; Faith was already embarrassed enough, being completely naked. And he&rsquo;s still forcing her to dance and go through more humiliation. But there was nothing she could do as her body kept moving against her wishes. Her feet moved in tune with his, doing the tango and spinning together.</p></p>

<p><p>He pulled her torso close to his and they were cheek to cheek. They continued to spin and move about slowly, with her legs following his pace in perfect unison.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s chin was resting against his shoulder. &ldquo;Stop...please...&rdquo; A teardrop appeared in the corner of her eyes. <a name=&quot;Dance_naked_kiss_neck&quot;></a></p></p>

<p><p>Now they were sidestepping slowly. Rubeus lowered his head and kissed her neck slowly and sensually. Her skin was so soft and sweet that he has to touch it every time he gets close to her. He turned his head slightly and kissed her shoulder. It was not so much kisses, but rather he was gliding his lips along the curves of her shoulder, smacking his lips against her curves slowly and tantalizingly.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith&rsquo;s head turned to the side. &ldquo;Ughhh...uhhhh...&rdquo; <a name=&quot;Dance_naked_kiss_lips&quot;></a></p></p>

<p><p>He could not control himself any longer...he had to taste her more. He removed his face from her cheek and they stared face to face. He forced his lips into hers...</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;MMMMMMFFFFF!!!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>For some reason, her lips taste better than before. Maybe it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s the thrill of kissing a naked woman...the fact that she&rsquo;s naked and ripe for the taking makes this even more enjoyable. He kept their lips locked as long as possible, and only stopped so he can breathe.</p></p>

<p><p> She could no longer hold back the tears...they streamed down her face like a river. She has already reached her limit...being forced to dance while wearing ribbons was bad enough...but now she&rsquo;s completely naked and has to go through the same thing again.</p></p>

<p><p>When the kiss was over, they resumed slow dancing. &ldquo;Please...stop...&rdquo; With one hand on her back, he lowered her torso while leaning forward, just like before. His left hand was grabbing her thigh, holding up her leg.</p></p>

<p><p>His face was in her breasts but now he can feel her bare skin. It felt even better than last time, at least one hundred times better. This has to be the best feeling in the world for a man. He can&rsquo;t see anything, so he closed his eyes to enjoy the sensations...the feel of her bare breasts...so soft and firm. And his hand was holding up her leg, he can feel its texture.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith moaned in pain and discomfort. Her head was dangling upside down and her eyes were closed. Tears drip from her eyes to the floor. As if being exposed wasn&rsquo;t bad enough, she&rsquo;s being forced to dance naked. But this isn&rsquo;t even tango, it&rsquo;s Rubeus&rsquo;s twisted perverted version of the dance.</p></p>

<p><p>Her leg was extended horizontally, being gripped by his cold, lifeless hand. She was standing on one leg, with her torso lowered. But the worst part was that his face was snuggling her breasts.</p></p>

<p><p>Then he reset her back to neutral position and continued to tango. <a name=&quot;Dance_naked_final_dance&quot;></a></p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;And the final dance...&rdquo; They continued to dance in circles and Faith was dizzy from the spinning. She had no idea they were moving towards the bed.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, her legs hit the edge of the bed. Rubeus leaned forward, causing them both to fall on the bed. *Plop*</p></p>

<p><p>And now, it was the moment that he was waiting for. The time when he can have his way with her body completely. It always leads up to this dreadful moment.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus let himself loose... and her fingers grabbed the bed sheet. She moaned and groaned in agony.</p></p>

<p><p>After reaching the other dimension, the heroes hid the dimensional pod and entered the capital city of Almerak. The streets were littered with people wandering about the marketplace. It was afternoon time, which is the busiest time in the market. Tyson, Nebula, Mac and Zelfire blended into the crowd, not sure of where to go.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So where do we begin?&rdquo; Tyson asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t plan ahead.&rdquo; said Zelfire.</p></p>

<p><p>Mac: &ldquo;Are we supposed to grab someone and ask them &lsquo;Hey have you heard of the Mirrari?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Neb: &ldquo;What else are we supposed to do?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>As per Mac&rsquo;s suggestion, all four of them separate and ask random people about the whereabouts of the Mirrari. They stayed close enough to be in each other&rsquo;s visible range.</p></p>

<p><p>An old man in a hood approached Nebula. &ldquo;Are you looking for the Mirrari?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah! Do you know something about it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact, I do.&rdquo; The old man showed him a scroll.</p></p>

<p><p>Neb signaled the others to come over. Now that the group was together, they can finally get some answers.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;First of all, who are you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m nobody important. Just a guy who possessed the Mirrari for a short while.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Everyone gasped.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I was the one who handed it to Princess Faith.&rdquo; said the beggar.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re the one who gave it to her.&rdquo; said Tyson.</p></p>

<p><p>Zell opened the <strong>scroll</strong> and read it.</p></p>

<p><p>The old beggar began to explain. &ldquo;The <strong>Mirrari</strong> is a cursed jewel that is known to tear people apart. It can even tear a kingdom apart. It changes the victim&rsquo;s personality to varying degrees. It can awaken your dark side or turn you into the opposite of what you are.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That explains a lot. I never cared about money but I became obsessed with winning the lottery.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The beggar continued. &ldquo;All humans are greedy, some more than others. Even if someone is altruistic and heroic, there&rsquo;s still a little bit of greed inside of him...it&rsquo;s human nature. The Mirrari will magnify that greed 10 times, even 100 times, while suppressing the person&rsquo;s other qualities, thus turning him into a different person. But it&rsquo;s not just greed that magnifies, but also lust and violence. It takes the worst part of human nature and magnifies it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> All the heroes glanced at each other.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The Mirrari can take your dark side and magnify it ten fold. Even though you&rsquo;re not a greedy person. There&rsquo;s still some part of you that wants money. Even if it&rsquo;s only one percent of your personality, the Mirrari will magnify that trait and make it 100%.</p></p>

<p><p>Now, money is all that care about and you will abandon everything and everyone to get it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s a cursed jewel.&rdquo; Nebula added.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s even worse than that...all it takes for you to change to is touch the Mirrari. No...you just need to be within range. It could be in the same building without you knowing about it, you will be affected like everyone else. If exposed long enough, the changes are permanent.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How do you know all this?&rdquo; Mac asked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I was the one who found it. I took it from the temple because I know someone else was looking for it. I have to keep it away from Rubeus at all costs.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Rubeus?&rdquo; Mac repeated. &ldquo;Why does that name sound familiar?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson fisted his own palm. &ldquo;I remember him! He was one of Faith&rsquo;s old archrivals.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I used to be a spy that worked for Squire. But the Mirrari has affected me. I no longer care about my loyalties. I only look out for myself now. Well I told you everything I know. You can keep the scroll for free.&rdquo; The old man walked away.</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="d">[ D ] - The Puppet Princess</span></p></center> 

<p> <p><a name=&quot;TheNakedPortrait&quot;></a>The Naked Portrait</p></p>

<p> <p>Two men sat on the floor and watched as the woman backed into the corner. &ldquo;No...no...&rdquo; she murmured.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus slowly stepped forward. &ldquo;Come, princess, it&rsquo;s time to make a portrait for us.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...no...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;As a king I will perform many great feats. So it&rsquo;s only natural that I have my image immortalized.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He used the puppet spell on her and she&rsquo;s under his control once again. He never gets tired of doing this. And the one other thing he never gets tired of doing...is her.</p></p>

<p><p>Her arms drop to her hips and she remained still as he walked up to her. He held the ribbon on her breasts and gasped. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be needing this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> He pulled it, making her spin like a top. As the ribbons came off, more of her body was revealed and the painters stared in awe. In a matter of seconds, her breasts were revealed, followed by her stomach. He kept on pulling the same ribbon and it came off her hips and fell to the floor. Their eyes didn&rsquo;t even blink. She was standing before these men butt naked. Instinctively she covered up her private parts.</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t just keep staring. Start painting.&rdquo; ordered Rubeus.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes my lord!&rdquo; said one of them. They picked up their paint brushes and began to work immediately.</p></p>

<p><p>He walked up to Faith who was trembling in fear. He placed his hand on her shoulders, then leaned in to embrace her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;By the way, I expect a masterpiece. If you make her look ugly, I will execute you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The two men looked up for a second. &ldquo;Yes my lord.&rdquo; They got back to work and sweated profusely.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus embraced the naked woman who was still trembling. His arms held her back and they were cheek to cheek. He smelled her hair and let out a sigh of pleasure. His left hand slipped lower and grabbed her butt cheek. Faith moaned slightly in reaction to his touches. Her arms wrapped around his back and her fingers held onto his robe.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Make sure you look at this from a good angle. A king needs to be seen with his concubine, like this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>His fingers squeezed her butt cheek harder, causing her to wince in discomfort. &ldquo;Uhhh...&rdquo; she moaned. Her fingers squeezed his robe tighter. Under the puppet spell, there was not much she could do but endure this. She could not even object because a slave has not right to object to her master&rsquo;s orders.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus put his face into her shoulder blade and kissed it gently. He kissed her neck and her cheek while smelling her skin. The more he violated her the more aroused he became.</p></p>

<p><p>The painters found it difficult to paint while he keeps moving. But they have no choice, for their lives were on the line.</p></p>

<p><p>He continued to kiss her neck and shoulder constantly, not stopping for a moment. Then he removed his cheek from hers and faced her directly. He went straight for her lips. &ldquo;MMMMFFF...&rdquo; Her head was tilted at an angle, but his arm held her back in perfect balance.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith continued to suffer in her helpless state. She has already endured a lot of torture and suffering from this villain, but the torture continues non-stop. Tears begin to swell up in her eyes and her fingers squeezed his robe tightly. Her eyelids slowly closed as she accepted her sad fate. All she can do was endure it no matter how painful its...she can pretend she&rsquo;s somewhere else...</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus&rsquo;s left hand moved away from her buttock and grabbed her thigh and lifted it against his waist.</p></p>

<p><p>The painters scribbled furiously on their canvas.</p></p>

<p><p>The longer he kissed her, the more aroused he became. Kissing a submissive woman like her was a turn on, but it&rsquo;s a different story when he&rsquo;s kissing a submissive woman that&rsquo;s naked. He can feel the skin on her back with his hands. He can feel her thigh against his waist. He can feel the warmth of her naked body against his body. He kept leaning into Faith, making her torso lower and lower, and at the same time lifting her leg up higher.</p></p>

<p><p>Standing on only one leg, she was losing balance. Eventually, they both fell down on the carpet. *Thud*</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus&rsquo;s face landed right where it should be - between her breasts. He started to kiss them and suck on them.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But what about the portrait?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The other painter elbowed him on the arm. &ldquo;Just keep going.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>As Rubeus was violating her breasts, his left hand was still on her thigh, and he rubbed it up and down. Faith groaned in discomfort and agony. Her fingers squeezed the carpet...and tears drip down her eyes. Those were the only movements she could make...</p></p>

<p><p>The painters were able to make four portraits with vibrant colors. First image - Faith was naked and covering her privates while Rubeus stood in front of her, looking menacing. Second image - of them embracing and Rubeus grabbing her butt. Third image - of them kissing with all the details. His hand was on her thigh. Fourth image - of him violating her on the floor.</p></p>

<p><p>A spy entered Squire&rsquo;s room and walked over to Squire to whisper something into his ear. &ldquo;I see.&rdquo; He signaled the spy to leave. &ldquo;Looks like Tyson Spade and company are inside the city.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady was in the corner of the room, leaning against the wall with his hands in his pockets. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good to know. I&rsquo;m sure Lord Rubeus will find that information helpful. By the way, are you sure it&rsquo;s okay to betray them? Aren&rsquo;t they your allies?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My only loyalty is to money only.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Man, the Mirarri sure is a mystery.&rdquo; Arkady dropped a bag of coins on the table. He proceeded to leave the room.</p></p>

<p><p>(The Mirrari can make a man like Squire change so much. The legend is true after all...it can cause entire kingdoms to fall. But it works to our advantage. Squire only cares about money - and a greedy man is easier to control.)</p></p>

<p><p><a name=&quot;SoldierHarassment&quot;></a>Soldier's Harassment</p></p>

<p> <p>Two soldiers were seen in the dining room, one of them carrying the Mirrari under his arm. <strong>Mylo</strong> was short and fat and had a beard. <strong>Pecha</strong>, on the other hand was average sized.</p></p>

<p><p>Pecha: &ldquo;Dude, are you sure about this? If Lord Rubeus finds out, he&rsquo;s going to have our heads.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mylo: &ldquo;Whoever possesses the Mirrari rules the kingdom. With this magical item, we can turn even Lord Rubeus into our slave.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But what if it doesn&rsquo;t work?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;If you want to obey him like a dog for the rest of your life, then sit this one out.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was clinging onto the wall while limping forward. Despite her condition, she still wanted to escape that awful nightmare. Rubeus has violated her day after day and she could not take it anymore. Upon hearing the voices of two men, she looked up.</p></p>

<p><p>Pecha and Mylo were both shocked to see such a scantily dressed woman appear before them. Purple ribbons were wrapped around her torso, covering her breasts down to her hips. But equally shocking was the fact that she&rsquo;s the princess.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hey, that&rsquo;s the princess!&rdquo; exclaimed Mylo.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ohhh...what a nice little bonus for us.&rdquo; Pecha said, chuckling.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give her a little greeting, how about it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This one is mine...heh heh...&rdquo; He walked up to her like a lecher, making grabbing gestures.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith covered her breasts with her arms and backed away. &ldquo;No...stay away!&rdquo; Her back hit the wall and she had no where to go.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon here baby!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...stay away!&rdquo; she shrieked. She was gasping for breath and her eyes were shaking from pure fear. This was the first time in a long time that she was able to move on her own free will. Rubeus has finally gone to do something else, and she just wanted to escape. She&rsquo;s no different than a newborn chick that just opened its eyes for the first time...she was naked, weak and vulnerable to predators. Each step Pecha took towards her was a step towards her demise.</p></p>

<p><p>Without thinking, she dashed to the side. He ran after her and grabbed the loose ribbon on her back. This made her spin away from him, while revealing more of her cleavage.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oooh.&rdquo; Pecha was happy that he saw more of her skin. Mylo was thinking the same thing, based on the perverted look on his face.</p></p>

<p><p> Faith looked down and realized what had just transpired, and became instantly embarrassed. But she had no time to react or do anything. Pecha tugged the ribbon towards him, making her spin towards him. He caught her from the back.</p></p>

<p><p>His arms reached around and grabbed both her breasts while he smelled her hair. She moaned in pain and discomfort. &ldquo;Uhhh...P-Please stop it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The noises she was making as well as her begging made him more excited. He squeezed her breasts even harder. &ldquo;Yes...beg some more!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith continued to moan louder and louder. It was extremely uncomfortable to have a man behind her, smelling her hair while his hands squeezed her breasts, treating them like ornaments. She was too weak and feeble to resist...her hands were dangling to the side while she was being harassed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Uhhhh! Uhhhh! Please stop!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Pecha then slammed her against the wall. Pressing his body against hers, he continued to harass her. Her cheek was trapped between the wall and his face. His nose was pressed against her cheek and she could feel his breath...and she did not like that...no man should be this close to her.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Your skin is so silky and smooth...as expected of the princess.&rdquo; he whispered into her ear. The way he said those words made her cringe.</p></p>

<p><p>He kissed her cheek, and she winced, closing her eyes. He slipped his hands around her arms and squeezed her breasts hard. &ldquo;Please...stop! Ugh! Uhhhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>His hips were pressed against her butt firmly, to prevent escape and for maximum pleasure. Leaning against her felt good - her body felt soft but firm. He grew more turned on as he continued to screw her...pressing his lower body against hers and smelling her hair...he sighed in pleasure while she moaned in pain.</p></p>

<p><p>While his buddy was having fun, Mylo grew bored and started playing with the Mirrari. &ldquo;I wonder how this thing works?&rdquo; He rubbed it with his hand. Suddenly it glowed and the entire room flashed. Mylo was startled.</p></p>

<p><p>Pecha was enjoying himself so he did not notice the quick flash that just happened. He kissed her shoulders all over and squeezed her breasts with his hands...not knowing that the woman he was screwing was a different one from seconds ago.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith pushed herself away from the wall, forcing them both to step back. She elbowed him and turned around.</p></p>

<p><p>Pecha: &ldquo;Ow, that hurt bitch!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She punched and he blocked it. She kept throwing punches and he backed away. One of them hit his nose. &ldquo;This must be the Mirrari&rsquo;s doing! Mylo turn her back to normal!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith threw a side kick into his stomach and he was knocked down. Then she glared at Mylo.</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;The Mirrari doesn&rsquo;t belong to you. Hand it over!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mylo desperately rubbed the orb but it won&rsquo;t glow. &ldquo;Crap...crap...&rdquo; He backed away while the princess approached. Even though he&rsquo;s a soldier, he doesn&rsquo;t know how to fight. He always skips training and would rather eat large chunks of meat than do actual work. Even when he has to train, he&rsquo;d do be lazy and do the bare minimum.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith made a fist and threw it at him and he winced. The Mirrari glowed just before her first reached his face. *Flash*</p></p>

<p><p>She remained still for a moment and was surprised and confused at the same time. Her arm went back to her body. Mylo realized that she&rsquo;s back to the helpless woman like before and smiled. He advanced while she retreated.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Pecha grabbed her from behind and squeezed her breasts.</p></p>

<p><p>Mylo was turned on by watching them. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get too rough. Save some for me, will ya?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, you&rsquo;ll get your turn. When I&rsquo;m done.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Pecha grabbed her chin and kissed her lips. He continued to kiss her neck and shoulder while squeezing her breasts firmly.</p></p>

<p><p>He shoved her against the wall so that they&rsquo;re face to face. &ldquo;No...please!&rdquo; He kissed her neck and breasts. Her head turned to the side completely. &ldquo;Uhhh! Uhhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mylo was holding the orb doing nothing. The orb glowed by itself.</p></p>

<p><p>Pecha kept screwing her non-stop. Faith had to escape but couldn&rsquo;t, she was trapped. Suddenly, Pecha felt a paralyzing pain in his groin. She had kneed his groin. He stepped back to grab his pain area. Then she punched him in the face. She got into fighting position.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mylo, why&rsquo;d you change her back to normal?&rdquo;<br>  &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t me! This thing has a mind of it&rsquo;s own, I swear!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well do something!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith charged and attacked. Pecha was pushed against the table.</p></p>

<p><p>Mylo rubbed the orb desperately. Finally it glowed.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith dropped her fighting guard. She turned around to run away. Pecha ran after her and grabbed her from behind. He kept pulling her towards the table.</p></p>

<p><p>Then he shoved her against the table. He grabbed her from behind while she was bent over. He grabbed her head and pushed her torso on the table. He put his face into her back and kissed it all over, and smelled her hair.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mmmm. You smell good. Tonight I&rsquo;m going to make the princess my woman.&rdquo; He continued to harass her.</p></p>

<p><p>Then he turned her over to face him. Her whole body turned around. His legs were inside of her hips, with her legs on the outside, and dangling off the table&rsquo;s edge. He put his face into her breasts and let himself loose. She screamed and groaned.</p></p>

<p><p>Mylo was bored and kept playing with the orb and it glowed again.</p></p>

<p><p>Pecha kept violating her and enjoyed himself. Faith&rsquo;s personality had changed back again in the middle of all this. Even though she wanted to resist, she was unable to do, in this position. One of her eyes opened. She was still moaning from his harassment. She moved her arms to shove his face away. He kept trying to lean into her. She pushed his chest away, then lifted up her legs and put her knees on his chest, and shoved him back. Then she kicked him, knocking him out cold.</p></p>

<p><p>She got off the table and she was pissed off. Mylo did not like the looks of this. She advanced towards him while he backed away.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is not a toy!&rdquo; She kicked the Mirrari out of his hands.</p></p>

<p><p>She grabbed him by the collar.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;W-wait...can&rsquo;t we talk about this?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I have nothing to talk about with you...after what you tried to do to me? You have the nerve to want to talk?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No wait...it was my partner&rsquo;s idea. I have nothing to do with it, I swear!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith tightened her grip on his collar. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m supposed to believe your lies? You&rsquo;re a traitor who defected to Rubeus!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Pecha woke up and grabbed the ball and rubbed it all over, then it glowed.</p></p>

<p><p>In an instant, Faith&rsquo;s anger resided and she was shocked for a second. She let Mylo go, then took a step back. &ldquo;W-What was I doing?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mylo knew she turned back to her vulnerable self. &ldquo;I believe you were making threats.&rdquo; He took a step forward while she took a step back.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No...I didn&rsquo;t mean it...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh really?&rdquo; he asked, slowly inching forward. He glanced at her figure from top to bottom.</p></p>

<p><p>She knew he was leering, and instinctively covered her breasts and her sacred spot.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith kept backing up until she hit the table. It was the same spot where Pecha violated her moments before. Mylo chuckled, knowing that she has no where to run to. He charged at her, smashing his face into her breasts. She screamed with her arms being held up by his hands.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please stop...stop it! Uhhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He kept pushing her and they fell on the table. &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; The top half of her body was on the table, while her legs were dangling off the edge. Mylo enjoyed himself even though he could barely breathe. He removed his face from her chest.</p></p>

<p><p>Then his hand grabbed her neck and he put his face close to hers and she winced.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;From now on you&rsquo;ll address me as sir. Got it?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith nodded. &ldquo;Y-Yes sir...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Good. That&rsquo;s a good girl.&rdquo; He licked her neck and her face. She winced.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s see what you got down here...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>His left hand grabbed one of her tits and squeezed it. &ldquo;Uhhh...please no! Please sir...uhhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Then he squeezed both her tits round and round. &ldquo;Uhhh! Please sir! Please no!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He was enjoying this a lot. He wanted to do all kinds of things to her and have her beg him all day.</p></p>

<p><p>He put his hand on her knee and glided it to her thigh. &ldquo;No...please sir...please...&rdquo; His hand moved into the ribbons into her sacred spot.</p></p>

<p><p>Her head titled and her body thrashed and convulsed. She screamed. &ldquo;Ughhhh! Ughhh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Then he took out a knife and pointed it at her face. She winced.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Should I cut your pretty face?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tears stream down her eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>Then he glided it down her neck and to her cleavage, at the tip of the ribbons. &ldquo;How about here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No please...sir...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He moved the knife to between her legs.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No please sir!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith feared for her life.</p></p>

<p><p>Then he poked the tip of the blade at her chin continuously while laughing at her.</p></p>

<p><p>The Mirrari glowed.</p></p>

<p><p>Mylo kept the blade pointed at her cheek while his other hand squeezed her left tit.</p></p>

<p><p>She moaned in agony. She did not want to stay like this. He dunked his face between her breasts.</p></p>

<p><p>Her fingers twitched. Some feeling restored to her arms. She had to get away.</p></p>

<p><p>She shoved his face away. He pointed the blade at her face, she grabbed his hand and pushed it to the side, the knife dropped. She kneed him in the stomach, then kicked him off the table.</p></p>

<p><p>She crawled backwards. Mylo climbed onto the table and crawled towards her on all fours.</p></p>

<p><p>The Mirrari glowed.</p></p>

<p><p>Mylo chuckled. &ldquo;So which princess are you now?&rdquo; But he can tell by the look in her eyes. It was a look of pure fear, it was the submissive one.</p></p>

<p><p>She kicked and he caught her leg with both hands. He pulled her leg into him, making her lie down completely. He kissed her thigh all over. She moaned in discomfort. Her arms did nothing, her fingers twitched.</p></p>

<p><p>Then he got on top of her and put his face into her breasts and motorboat them.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Uhhh! Please sir! Stop! Please!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He violated her like that for a while. Her arms were flailing and her legs thrashed about.</p></p>

<p><p>Then he kissed her neck and her chin and her lips. Tears drip down her eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>He continued to violate her.</p></p>

<p><p>He found a banana and shoved it between her legs, causing her to moan and squirm. Then he shoved the banana into her mouth. It was gross. But it was a turn on to him.</p></p>

<p><p>He then peeled off the banana. One hand groped her breast while he ate the banana. Eating and raping are his two favorite hobbies.</p></p>

<p><p>She has a flashback of why she&rsquo;s so submissive. Her father was very protective of her. He tells to follow the rules and if she didn&rsquo;t, he&rsquo;d punish her. So she developed a personality that follows orders.</p></p>

<p><p>Mylo finished the banana and tossed the peel away. He shoved his face into her breasts. She screamed for her life.</p></p>

<p><p>He kissed her lips and tears stream down her eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>The Mirrari glowed. Mylo kept raping her non-stop.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith kept using her hips and hands to move backwards. Her head was completely off the table. She kept moving, inch by inch. Her torso was diagonal and they lost balance and fell off. *Thud*</p></p>

<p><p>Mylo was out of it for moments. Faith turned over to her back and crawled away backwards. She got on her knees. She was watching Mylo in fear.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Pecha grabbed her hair from behind and yanked it. &ldquo;Heh. Got you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He reached down to squeeze her left tit. He kissed her shoulder and her neck, and her face. She winced and moaned. Then he squeezed both her tits, causing her to moan even more.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please stop! Please sir!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sir? Heh Mylo, you trained her well. This is more like it!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please stop! Ugh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>His right hand reached down further to touch her thigh and reach into the ribbons. She was in extreme discomfort, as she&rsquo;s being violated in two places at once. He was also smelling her hair. He kissed her cheek. She was being violated in three places at once. Tears drip down her eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>Then his right hand grabbed her chin, forcing her lips into his lips. Tears drip down her eyes. His other hand was still groping her breast and he squeezed it round and round. She was in extreme discomfort, wit her lips and her breast being violated at the same time.</p></p>

<p><p>While still lip locked, his hand let go of her breast and reached down to her thigh and shoved it into the ribbons. More tears drip down her eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>Mylo just woke up from a daze. &ldquo;Save some for me, will ya?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Pecha: &ldquo;You just had your turn, now it&rsquo;s my turn.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He continued to squeeze her breasts.</p></p>

<p><p>Mylo then walked over to them and shoved Pecha.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hey what&rsquo;s the big idea?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;My turn isn&rsquo;t done yet.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care! You had her for a while. Now it&rsquo;s my turn.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my fault she kicked your ass. Heh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Pecha got mad and grabbed him by the collar. &ldquo;Listen chump, don&rsquo;t mess with me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mylo punched him in the face, knocking him on the floor. Then he turned over to the princess, who was kneeling and covering her privates.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now...where were we?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She was trembling. He grabbed her by the arms and leaned forward, and they laid down. He smothered his face into her breasts.</p></p>

<p><p>Pecha wanted to get even. He grabbed the Mirrari and rubbed it, and it glowed. He wanted the princess to beat him up.</p></p>

<p><p>But there was no change. Faith continued to groan while Mylo violated her.</p></p>

<p><p>Pecha: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not working? Or maybe she can&rsquo;t fight back like this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Pecha grabbed Mylo, pulling him off the woman.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the big idea, that hurt, dumbass!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Listen chump, this was my idea. So I get dibs on the woman.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t have done it if I didn&rsquo;t follow along.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You wanted to back out.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Pecha&rsquo;s eyes focused on Faith to see what she was doing.</p></p>

<p><p>She was panting for breath. She started to move, getting off her back.</p></p>

<p><p>They continued to argue. Pecha wanted to distract him long enough for her to recover.</p></p>

<p><p>She leaned against the wall sideways.</p></p>

<p><p>Pecha: &ldquo;Who died and made you boss?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mylo: &ldquo;It was my idea to do this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m risking my life too.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well how do you want to settle this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s simple. I&rsquo;m the better soldier so I should get dibs on her.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ridiculous! You&rsquo;re so out of shape.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Look who&rsquo;s talking. You skip out on all your workouts. You don&rsquo;t even know how to fight.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Why you...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Pecha: &ldquo;Okay okay...calm down. You know what...you can have her.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Save some for me, okay?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Pecha turned his attention to his prey. Faith was leaning against the wall and trembling. He leaned his body against hers and violated her back. She groaned.</p></p>

<p><p>Then she used her hands to push against the wall, shoving both of them backwards. She pried his hands off her chest and turned around and shoved his face away.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon baby...give papa a kiss!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She punched him in the face.</p></p>

<p><p>Mylo: &ldquo;Ow...wait...you&rsquo;re the fighter one?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She punched again and he ducked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;When did you switch personalities?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She grabbed him by the shoulders and threw a knee into his stomach, knocking him out.</p></p>

<p><p>Pecha smiled since his plan worked out.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith turned to Pecha and did a fighting pose. He rubbed the Mirrari and it glowed. Faith let go of her pose and became stupefied. She backed away to the wall.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No sir...please...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now...get on your knees.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She didn&rsquo;t respond.</p></p>

<p><p>He pulled the sword slightly out of its sheath, not all the way, but enough to see the blade.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Do it...or else it&rsquo;s going to hurt.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith got on her knees and hands.</p></p>

<p><p>Pecha grabbed her hair and yanked her head backwards.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That kick earlier hurt, bitch.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry sir...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now...say this. I am the strongest fighter in the kingdom!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the strongest fighter in the kingdom!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Say you&rsquo;re weak and useless.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m weak and useless!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Say you&rsquo;re my woman.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>She hesitated.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Say it! You&rsquo;re my woman!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m your woman...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He kissed her lips while groping her breast.</p></p>

<p><p>Mylo looked afraid and pointed his finger at Pecha. &ldquo;Look behind you!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Pecha: &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus was behind them. Pecha turned around and gasped. He released the female and stood next to companion and both of them bowed. It was clear that Rubeus was not pleased with them, actually, he was angry. He used shadow puppet to control them and make them get on their knees.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who told you to leave your posts? Who said you could touch the princess?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mylo: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry sir. We caught her trying to escape.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Pecha: &ldquo;It was an honest mistake. It won&rsquo;t happen again, I promise!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No one touches my woman...except for me, understood?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes sir!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus took a glance at the glowing orb. &ldquo;Why&rsquo;s the Mirrari here?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Pecha: &ldquo;The princess stole it. We tried to stop her.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus released the spell, and they both sighed in relief. &ldquo;Get out of my sight.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The two cowards ran away.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was on her knees, one hand over her breasts and one hand squeezing the ribbons between her legs. Rubeus took a step forward. &ldquo;As long as I&rsquo;m here, no other man can touch you. I won&rsquo;t even allow a woman touch you! Is that understood?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith gasped in pure fear.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Is that understood?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mylo and Pecha ran down the hallway while panting for breath. &ldquo;We got lucky dude. He was about to execute us.&rdquo; Mylo exclaimed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He actually believed that the princess was the one who stole the Mirrari instead of us. What a lucky break.&rdquo; said Pecha. Suddenly, he had a look of surprise on his face.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; asked Mylo.</p></p>

<p><p>An arrow hit his back exactly where the heart is located. He fell down. Down the hall, Arkady was seen holding a bow.</p></p>

<p><p>Mylo stepped back. &ldquo;No...wait! Not me!&rdquo; He ran for it. The arrow hit him in the back. He fell on his knees. The arrow hit a vital organ of his and he knew he was done for. He fell on his face and uttered his last breath.</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="e">[ E ] - Storm the Palace </span></p></center>


<p><p>After receiving the scroll regarding the cursed jewel, the heroes were on their way to the palace. They stopped walking when all of them sensed a threatening ki...three to be exact. Cruton, Arkady and Ren appear on the rooftop, looking down on the heroes.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tyson, you go ahead to the palace.&rdquo; said Zelfire.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you guys at the palace.&rdquo; He floated up to the sky and flew off like a rocket.</p></p>

<p><p>All the villains and heroes vanished out of sight.</p></p>

<p><p> Nebula ended up in the same area as Arkady, who was holding a bow and has a patch of arrows on his back. (He&rsquo;s an archer just like Marianna)</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady shot one arrow forward. Nebula drew his sword and cut the arrow into smithereens. Arkady smiled and ran away from him, Nebula chased him. *Doosh doosh* He loaded up one arrow after another. *Twang* One arrow was the same height as Neb&rsquo;s head. He cut it. The second arrow was at the height of his knee. He cut it.</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady jumped onto the wall with ninja like reflexes then jumped onto the ground. Nebula was right behind him, running just as fast as him. *Doosh doosh* He loaded one arrow, fired it and loaded up another immediately after the first one. *Twang twang*</p></p>

<p><p>Neb slipped his head to the side. The arrow missed him by two inches and he noticed that the second arrow followed the first arrow, its head was actually touching the first arrow&rsquo;s tail. (One arrow right behind the other? He&rsquo;s testing different variations on me. I have to be careful of this guy.)</p></p>

<p><p>(I thought he would use that sword to defend against it. If he cut the first arrow, the second one would pierce him. I didn&rsquo;t expect him to dodge, he must have realized something was up. This guy has sharp instincts and he&rsquo;s observant.)</p></p>

<p><p>They were able to learn so much about each other without exchanging a single word. Arkady loaded up two arrows at the same time and released them. Nebula cut them both. *Slish slash* (He can fire two at the same time? How many can he do at once?)</p></p>

<p><p>The archer ran away with ninja like speed and hopped onto a rooftop. Neb was in hot pursuit, not lacking in the speed department. Arkady led Neb to an open area, while he was hiding behind some ruble.</p></p>

<p><p>He loaded up another arrow and he closed his eyes...charging up the arrow with his ki and it became red.</p></p>

<p><p>(He&rsquo;s putting his ki into the arrow?)</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Take this, my special technique, the Demonic Arrow!&rdquo; Arkady released it and it went full speed ahead towards our hero.</p></p>

<p><p>Neb waited for it to get within range and took a swing at it, but the arrow curved around him and passed him. It made a 180 degree turn. Neb jumped away from it. The arrow was being controlled by Arkady and it&rsquo;s homing in on its target. Neb can&rsquo;t shake it off because it kept making circles around him. Neb ran head on towards the wall and jumped up at the last minute. The arrow with red ki went through the concrete wall. Neb dashed away at full speed.</p></p>

<p><p>(The Demonic Arrow can pass through a concrete wall? If I make an energy shield around my body it won&rsquo;t work. The arrow will just pierce through it and hit me directly. There&rsquo;s only one way to deal with it.) He gathered ki and put it into his sword. He turned around and slashed the arrow.</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady loaded up three arrows at once and fired them at once. *Twang* Neb was startled and did what he could. He cut the first two but the third one scraped his leg. Knowing that victory is near for him, Arkady loaded another three arrows. He charged them all with red ki. &ldquo;Demonic Arrows!&rdquo; As soon as he fired them, Neb dashed away. Even dashing at full speed, the arrows were hot on his trail and it&rsquo;s impossible to outrun them.</p></p>

<p><p>Knowing that, Neb instead made a 180 turn and headed for Arkady. The arrows also made a 180 turn. One of them hit a nearby object and exploded. (If I can disable his bow he can&rsquo;t attack anymore.) Neb drew his sword and slashed and Arkady jumped backwards. The two arrows went past them and hit a building and exploded.</p></p>

<p><p>(He&rsquo;s going on the offensive now. He must think I have the same weakness other archers have. Once you destroy their bow, they are useless. But I am different. I can use sorcery to generate arrows out of thin air, including a bow if I need to.)</p></p>

<p><p>The wind blew hard as Cruton and Macintosh stared at each other. Cruton summoned a bunch of orbs around his body - this move is pretty much a duplicate of Rubeus&rsquo;s Orb Storm. With a wave of his arm, he threw two orbs at Mac, who dodged them. *Bam* The orbs exploded with the impact of a small dynamite.</p></p>

<p><p>Cruton then threw four orbs forward. Mac ran to the side while covering his face. *Bam* Smoke covered the place.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You did well to dodge those attacks. But can you dodge this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mac looked around and saw nothing, then he looked up and gasped. There were twenty orbs directly above him.</p></p>

<p><p>Cruton raised his right arm and swings it down, and all the orbs came down on him. There&rsquo;s no way he can dodge them all, he dashed around with a cross arm block over his face.*Bam bam bam* The orbs rained on him and a few hit him in various places.</p></p>

<p><p>When the dust settled and smoke cleared, Mac was still standing, although bleeding from the leg and right arm. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m impressed you managed to survive that.&rdquo; said Cruton.</p></p>

<p><p>Macintosh powered up and became full of ki. He dashed forward and threw an energy ball at his target. Cruton blurred and appeared somewhere else. Mac fired a beam from his palms. Cruton summoned orbs around him, then appeared somewhere else.</p></p>

<p><p> The orbs gravitate towards Mac. He dodged them. Cruton appeared to his side and punched him. Mac was knocked down. (This guy and his energy orbs can be in two different places and he can control them from anywhere!)</p></p>

<p><p>Meanwhile, somewhere not far away...Zelfire and Ren did the stare down. Usually Zell likes to feel out his opponent first, but this time he wanted to get straight to the point. Wasting no time, he powered up and his body was surrounded by a white aura. Upon seeing how serious his opponent is, Ren also powered up.</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire charged forward at full force without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation. He intended his next combo to be the last combo of the fight. Ren used his specialty, the Power Wave. He gathered energy into one fist and punched the ground, creating a shockwave that moves forward. Zell quickly rolled out of harm&rsquo;s way.</p></p>

<p><p>He wanted to end this fight quick so he can meet up with Tyson, but he wasn&rsquo;t expecting an attack like that. Ren charged forward with a fired up fist, Zell jumped up. Ren punched the ground, and everything within his radius blew up.</p></p>

<p><p>Zell floated to the air, and shortly afterwards, Ren joined him at the same altitude.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Was it too hot for you?&rdquo; Ren taunted.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve dealt with worse.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you worse!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Ren gathered ki into his fist and it became a ball of fire. He dashed forward and Zell did a cross arm block. The heat was too much and he quickly evaded to the side. Part of his sleeves were completely burned off and some of his skin was burned. Without exchanging words they both knew what the other was feeling. Zelfire was at a disadvantage against Ren&rsquo;s raw power.</p></p>

<p><p>Ren flew into him and let out a flurry of punches. *Pow pow pow* Zell blocked them all while moving away. Ren kicked him in the stomach, causing him to land on the top of a tower.</p></p>

<p><p>Zell gathered energy and fired the Energy Blast. Ren knocked it away with both arms. His fist turned into a fireball and he headed downwards. Zell quickly jumped out of harm&rsquo;s way. Ren&rsquo;s attack combined with gravity was stronger than before. The tower exploded on impact...each floor blew up one after another.</p></p>

<p><p>The citizens nearby watched in awe as the tower exploded into smithereens.</p></p>

<p><p>Sounds of energy blasts were heard as well as the scream of several guards. Smoke came out of Tyson&rsquo;s palm. He just blasted some guards that got in his way. Their bodies lay on the floor with smoke coming out of them. They were not dead, just injured and unconscious because he held back his attacks. (Why did these soldiers attack me? Did the Mirrari do this?) His thoughts were interrupted when he sensed a powerful presence in the room. It must be him...</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus appeared from the hallway. The two rivals have not seen each other in a long time and took a moment to do the stare down. Many things were going through Tyson&rsquo;s mind and his opponent as well. But Tyson remained focused on his primary objective. &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The princess? Safe and sound in her room. You are not needed here. I&rsquo;m the only man she needs.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The one that&rsquo;s not needed is you! You kidnapped her and stole the Mirarri!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus powered up. &ldquo;I am the king of this palace! And I&rsquo;m going to teach you some manners.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Too bad, I&rsquo;m a slow learner!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>A bunch of orbs appeared near his head and upper torso. With a wave of his arm, three orbs flew towards his target. Tyson ran to the side to dodge the balls. *Boom* Rubeus made three more orbs fly to him. And he kept throwing them until there was none left. Tyson ran in circles and didn&rsquo;t stop even for a split second. *Boom boom boom boom*</p></p>

<p><p> Rubeus summoned another twenty orbs near his body. Tyson was tired of running in circles and used Energy Shield. Some of the balls hit the shield and bounced away. The sorcerer then made a motion with both arms. The orbs began to combine into a bigger orb. Now it&rsquo;s the size of half his body. He threw the orb and hit Tyson&rsquo;s energy shield. After seconds of struggling, the shield broke and Tyson was hit. He was knocked away a few feet.</p></p>

<p><p>He recovered and stood up on his feet. But he realized he&rsquo;s in trouble. (I can use the Energy Shield to block the orbs. But then he&rsquo;ll just use that bigger orb to break my shield. And if I don&rsquo;t use my shield, I&rsquo;ll get hit by the smaller orbs.)</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tyson Spade, you never had a chance to begin with. Allow me to demonstrate.&rdquo; Rubeus&rsquo;s eyes glowed white and used the <strong>puppet spell</strong>.</p></p>

<p><p>At first, he thought it had no effect...until he tried to move. &ldquo;What...is going on?&rdquo; Neither his arms nor legs would do what he wanted them to do. He tried to bend his elbows with all his might...he groaned and used all his willpower...but it was no use. An invisible force was restraining his limbs.</p></p>

<p><p>Unbeknownst to him, there was a puppet master controlling Tyson with strings. Normal humans cannot see it, but Rubeus can. He can see all the strings that connect to his body and limbs.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now...let&rsquo;s see you bow before your king.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Tyson fell on one knee. &ldquo;Ugh.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s much better. What else should have you do before I kill you? Or maybe I should kill you right now?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is impossible! I don&rsquo;t care what tricks you&rsquo;re using...you&rsquo;re not going to control me!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You know what? I think I&rsquo;ll have you strangle yourself. That&rsquo;s a fitting way to die for a peasant like you. I don&rsquo;t want to get my hands dirty.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> &ldquo;I have no choice but to use <strong>that</strong>.&rdquo; Tyson released all the ki in his body and his hair turned golden.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo; Rubeus&rsquo;s eyes winced from the bright light.</p></p>

<p><p>All the strings on Tyson&rsquo;s body broke and he was able to stand up. Rubeus was bewildered. Not only did his enemy&rsquo;s appearance change, but so has the tide of the battle. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like this before. You didn&rsquo;t transform last time...what kind of sorcery is this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not sorcery. It&rsquo;s a power that I discovered recently...I&rsquo;m a super sayan.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Super Sayan?&rdquo; The sorcerer had never heard of such a thing.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an ability that my race has. I&rsquo;m not from here...I&rsquo;m from another world...outside this planet.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Outside this planet?&rdquo; Rubeus was more shocked. He never imagined that such a world can exist.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson blurred and appeared closer to Rubeus, then blurred again. Rubeus dashed to the side to avoid the incoming attack. He summoned a bunch of orbs and threw them at Tyson. The super sayan ran straight ahead and put his arm over his face, blocking the orbs with just his forearm. *Bam bam bam*</p></p>

<p><p>Within seconds, Tyson got within reach and let out a flurry of punches. Rubeus blocked them all. Both of them jumped away from each other. Rubeus&rsquo;s arms were aching...the super sayan&rsquo;s punches were much stronger than he anticipated.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus formed another group of orbs. This time, he combined all of them into one bigger orb. Tyson put his palms together and put them to the side, gathering energy for a big attack. Once Rubeus was done, he was controlling a ball of energy bigger than himself. It was floating up and down, ready to explode at any time. He threw the orb forward.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson threw his palms forward and fired the Super Sayan Beam - a beam made of pure golden light. It destroyed Rubeus&rsquo;s unnamed attack...and headed straight for him. Rubeus dodged to the side and the beam went past him and down the hall and exploded. Suddenly, Tyson was in the air and kicked him in the face and chest. *Wham whack wham*</p></p>

<p><p>During the confusion, nobody noticed Squire sneaking into the palace for the purpose of getting the <strong>Mirrari</strong>. He can sense its aura from where he is and found the room that the cursed jewel was stored in. He was still in his greedy state. But collecting money and gold from people was not enough for him...he wanted more. Holding the glowing orb in his hands, a grin fell upon his face. If he could sell the glowing orb, it could be worth millions...even billions.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus was battered and panting for breath. It has been a while since he&rsquo;s had so much trouble with an opponent. His eyes glowed and used the puppet spell again.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson found himself unable to move yet again. He grunted and strained his muscles but it was no use. Just now he had an idea. He powered down to normal state...and now he can move again. He dashed forward and hit Rubeus with an elbow to the chest. The sorcerer was knocked back a few steps. &ldquo;Ugh...what?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You little trick won&rsquo;t work anymore. I can transform and un-transform at will.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus wiped the blood off his lips. &ldquo;Unbelievable.&rdquo; (I can&rsquo;t believe he found a way to break the spell. When he becomes a super sayan, the puppet sees him as a different person than before. And when he returns to normal, he&rsquo;s being treated as a different person. The puppet master is confused...)</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re out of tricks and out of time. Get out of my way.&rdquo; said the sayan, who was confident in his victory.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not out of tricks yet. I still have one more trick up my sleeve. If I can&rsquo;t defeat you, I&rsquo;ll bring out someone who can.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson was confused. He got into fighting stance.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus began to chant and his body glowed with a white aura. In front of him a black dot appeared and with each passing second, the dot grew bigger and bigger. Tyson&rsquo;s eyes opened wide as he has no idea what&rsquo;s going on. It was a move he has used in the past - he opens a portal where demons would come out.</p></p>

<p><p> Squire was running in a dark hallway that was illuminated by the Mirrari. He felt very tired for some reason and took a break. He held the glowing orb in front of his face and stared at it...and it began to glow.</p></p>

<p><p>All of a sudden, the look in Rubeus&rsquo;s eyes changed. It was no longer full of malice and evil, but rather, he had the look of confusion. He released his ki and the white aura round his body vanished, along with the black hole. &ldquo;Why were we fighting?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson was now as equally confused as him. &ldquo;What kind of trick is this?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no trick. I think it&rsquo;s stupid that we are fighting over a woman.&rdquo; Rubeus then powered down and his ki disappeared, much to Tyson&rsquo;s surprise. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have the desire to fight anymore.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson relaxed a bit. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me...this is the Mirarri&rsquo;s effect?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; the sorcerer replied. &ldquo;But I changed my mind. If this is the Curse of the Mirrari, then so be it. I am doing what I feel is right. Go and get your princess...before I change my mind.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson reverted back to normal state and ran past him. Rubeus&rsquo;s sudden change reminded him of the old man&rsquo;s words. (Even if it&rsquo;s only one percent of your personality, the Mirrari will magnify that trait and make it 100%.) The Mirrari doesn&rsquo;t generate new personalities out of thin air, but takes traits were already in a person and magnifies them. The fact that Rubeus became a pacifist means he has a good side? He brushed that thought aside when he found the door that leads the princess&rsquo;s room. He didn&rsquo;t bother to use the knob, the kicked the door open, breaking it into pieces.</p></p>

<p><p>Upon hearing the noise, Faith gasped and looked up. She was kneeling on the bed with curtains covering three sides. She pulled the curtain away and her eyes lit up as she saw the one thing she did not expect to see. It was the man she loved with all her heart but also the man she betrayed. Even though she tried to kill him and leave him, here he is to rescue her, as always.</p></p>

<p><p>All the emotions exploded inside of her and the tears began to swell up in her eyes almost instantly. She has shed many tears already, but she still had a lot left, and upon seeing this man&rsquo;s face, all the remaining tears dripped down her cheek like a running faucet.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tyson...&rdquo; He opened his arms. She hopped off the bed and ran into him. Her arms wrapped them around his neck and her face was buried in his shoulder. &ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d come for me!&rdquo; she cried out, sobbing profusely. With such strong emotions swelling up inside of her, she didn&rsquo;t know what else to say. His shoulder felt warm and comfortable, and this is the shoulder that made her feel safe and secure. She continued to sob and let everything out.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t hurt you, did he?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I waited for you for a long time.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I should have gotten here sooner.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady was on the run with Nebula right behind him. While running he loaded arrows into this bow and shot them from a close range. Neb cut the arrows down as they came. Both of them stopped running at once. Neb put his sword away, surprising Arkady. He shot one arrow after another. Nebula fired a purple energy beam and he made it curve up and down, destroying the arrows in different altitudes.</p></p>

<p><p>(He can control the beam just like my demonic arrow?) Arkady jumped to the left to avoid the incoming beam. The beam went to the right and exploded on the wall. The explosion knocked Arkady onto the ground.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula floated up to the sky. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve shown me all your attacks but you haven&rsquo;t seen mine.&rdquo; He put his palms together and fired a beam.</p></p>

<p><p>Arkady ran away but the beam was faster than him. He turned around and realized he can&rsquo;t outrun it. &ldquo;No...no!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The beam hit him in the back. *Zap* &ldquo;Aaaaaaah!&rdquo; he screamed as the beam incapacitated him.</p></p>

<p><p>*Bam Bam* Mac jumped away from explosions. He was unable to get near Cruton and all he did was dodge his orbs and observe. But he won&rsquo;t be able to do that forever because eventually the orbs will hit him. *Bam bam* He jumped away and landed in a crouch. Just now he noticed something.</p></p>

<p><p>(When Cruton makes the orbs move he has to do that arm gesture, that&rsquo;s when he&rsquo;s open for one second.)</p></p>

<p><p>Cruton continued his relentless attack. Orbs came from different directions and gravitated towards Mac. He dashed forward and took the orbs head on, letting them hit his arms. Cruton was ready for him. Mac let out a fury of punches and Cruton blocked with a regular guard. *Pow pow pow* They flew up while hitting.</p></p>

<p><p>Mac was able to get close enough to hit him in the stomach, causing Cruton to groan in pain. Mac then threw a hook at his face. *Pow*</p></p>

<p><p>Cruton was annoyed and he wanted payback. He gathered energy and put his palms forward. Mac did the same. They fired beams at the same time and collided in the middle. *Kaboom*</p></p>

<p><p>Both of them landed to conserve their energy and re-strategize. Cruton continued his attack from earlier. He summoned a bunch of orbs and vanished and appeared somewhere else.</p></p>

<p><p>Mac got ready for the incoming onslaught. He extended his arms forward and opened his palms and fired the Electro-shockwave. Cruton waved his arm and the orbs gravitated towards their target. He was expecting Mac to dodge it as usual, but doesn&rsquo;t move, which shocked him. The shockwave was already coming at him and there was no time to move away. Cruton did a cross arm block and the beam hit him. The orbs hit Macintosh and exploded.</p></p>

<p><p>The beam pushed Cruton all the way until he hit the wall...he was embedded into the wall and his body was smoking. He tried to move but his body received too much damage. When the smoke cleared, Mac was still standing unharmed.</p></p>

<p><p>Cruton&rsquo;s eyes opened wider. (How is he still standing? No way...he put extra power into his beam so that when it fired, the recoil pushed him back, avoiding my orbs.)</p></p>

<p><p>Macintosh avoided the final attack but he was not unharmed. He was battered and bruised and there were holes on his shirt. (Looks like my idea worked.)</p></p>

<p><p>(Usually when someone shoots a beam they want to be grounded. They use the horse stance and plant their feet firmly in the ground. But instead he did the opposite...to come up with a strategy like that, he must be a genius...or completely stupid.)</p></p>

<p><p>(To deal with someone with an ability like yours, I can&rsquo;t use an orthodox strategy.)</p></p>

<p><p>Cruton was too tired to even stay awake and he fell unconscious. His eyes closed and his head dropped.</p></p>

<p><p>  Zelfire and Ren powered up to their maximum level. They were going to give it all they&rsquo;ve got for their next attack, it was all or nothing. Ren&rsquo;s fist turned into fire and he charged forward like a fireball.</p></p>

<p><p>Zell used the Spirit Blast, a shockwave that hits anybody within his radius. It damages the neurons of the person, causing them to be paralyzed for a brief moment. Ren was caught by complete surprise. While he&rsquo;s shaken up, Zell charged forward with ki into his fist and punched him hard. *Thud* Ren was knocked away into a nearby store. *Crash* He landed on a basket of fruits.</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire and Mac entered the main hall of the palace. Nebula was sitting on the fountain. &ldquo;Took you guys long enough.&rdquo; he said in a cocky tone. &ldquo;I was falling asleep waiting for you.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zell placed his hands on his hips. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get too carried away, youngster. You just got here. I sensed you just minutes ago.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But I still got here before you.&rdquo; Neb retorted.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus entered the main hall and everyone became alert. &ldquo;What are you all doing here?&rdquo; The look in his eyes indicated he has turned evil again. &ldquo;This is <strong>my</strong> palace!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Mac was concerned only about his friend. &ldquo;What happened to Tyson?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about someone else when you&rsquo;re about to meet your end.&rdquo; Rubeus powered up and glowed with white aura.</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire powered up, followed by Nebula and Macintosh. Although they just finished a battle, they had enough time to rest so their ki&rsquo;s were fresh and powerful.</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, the Mirrari flashed. It was different than it&rsquo;s normal flash as this was more intense and powerful. Squire held it up at eye level. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo; The flashing became more intense and the spirit of the jewel traveled to Squire&rsquo;s body. He screamed in agony as he was being possessed.</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="f">[ F ] - The Mirrari's True Form </span></p></center>

<p><p>The Mirrari&rsquo;s glow extended to places beyond the palace...the entire environment began to change. The palace was no longer in the capital city, but transported to an unknown place. It was in the middle of a plains areas with green hills and mountains in the background.</p></p>

<p><p> Squire ran out of the palace, still screaming and groaning from the agony. Nebula and others ran outside to check on the commotion.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What the hell? Where are we?&rdquo; asked Macintosh.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I have no idea. Hey isn&rsquo;t that Squire?&rdquo; Zell commented.</p></p>

<p><p>Squire&rsquo;s body was releasing ki without his control. His body was surrounded by a strange but powerful aura as he continued to groan. Wings sprouted from his back and opened fully. Everyone was bewildered by such an eye opening sight. The wings were pure white and white feathers floated gently onto the ground. His image resembled that of an angel...but not the good kind, more like the angel of death.</p></p>

<p><p>Neb made a grimace. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not Squire? Who are you?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the spirit of the Mirrari and I have taken over the body of the human you call Squire.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>[Split screen - 3] - [Nebula, Macintosh, Zelfire]</p></p>

<p><p>Squire began to power up and it was unlike anything the heroes have seen. The ground was shaking and rocks floated up.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson placed Faith in a sitting position against the wall. &ldquo;Stay put. I&rsquo;m going to check out what&rsquo;s happening outside.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Come back soon.&rdquo; she murmured. Then she handed him a rose.</p></p>

<p><p>He stared at it and smiled. &ldquo;I will...I promise.&rdquo; He put the rose in his pocket and jumped out the window. He was confused by nearly everything he saw - the sky was different. When he entered the palace, there were dark clouds looming over, but now the sky was clear blue. And not to mention, Squire stood before him with wings.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on here? Where are we?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Squire&rsquo;s eyes darted to the side to look at Tyson. &ldquo;Not where, but when. You are in a world inside the Mirrari...<strong>my world</strong> from 500 years ago.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Five hundred years ago?!&rdquo; Tyson exclaimed.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Just like everyone else, you&rsquo;ve fallen under my spell multiple times.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Your spell?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. You thought that the Mirrari was a cursed jewel. But it&rsquo;s true form is actually me a sorcerer who lived over 500 years ago.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a sorcerer like Rubeus?&rdquo; Macintosh asked.</p></p>

<p><p>Squire got mad. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even compare me to him! Rubeus was another foolish human who was under my influence. No one is immune to my effect. In my time, I was the most powerful sorcerer. I had the ability to change people&rsquo;s personalities according to my will. If I wanted someone to surrender, all I had to do was seek the fear inside them and magnify that fear one hundred fold. I&rsquo;ve always had my way. But then...an even more powerful sorcerer fought me and turned me into a jewel...that was my curse.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; said Zelfire. &ldquo;So now that you&rsquo;re free, you&rsquo;re going to continue what you started, right? Something like getting revenge on the world.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; Squire replied eagerly.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tch. You sound like the typical villain I&rsquo;ve dealt with many times.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m different. You&rsquo;ll soon find out that my power is incomparable.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula stepped forward. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s find out then!&rdquo; He powered up and dashed forward at full speed. Being the most impulsive one in the group, he is usually the one who attacks first, partly because he wants action and he thinks he can end the fight quickly. He let out a fury of punches while Squire dodged by slipping left and right. They kept hitting as they floated up to the sky.</p></p>

<p><p>Squire blocked Nebula&rsquo;s fist and saw an opening and countered with a punch to the nose. *Pow* Then he kicked Neb&rsquo;s chest, causing him to fall.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson did a high kick and hit Squire on the head. *Whack*</p></p>

<p><p>Neb stopped himself from falling just before he hit the ground. He regained control of himself and pushed all his ki towards his back side, causing his body to bounce up. *Whoosh*</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson and Squire exchanged blows in the air. *Pow bam pow*</p></p>

<p><p>Mac was a safe distance away and gathered energy for a beam. When Squire knocked Tyson away, Mac fired.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson landed in a crouch.</p></p>

<p><p>Mac&rsquo;s beam headed straight for its target and Squire blocked it with his forearm. Zelfire snuck up behind him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I can see you.&rdquo; said Squire. Zelfire gasped.</p></p>

<p><p>Squire vanished and appeared to his side...and punched Zell, knocking him down. *Wham* He fell into someone&rsquo;s body. It was Tyson who was already a <strong>super sayan</strong>.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You got me.&rdquo; said Zell in gratitude.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This guy is a tough one.&rdquo; said Tyson. Considering how many strong opponents he&rsquo;s fought in the past, him saying this is a testament to the Mirrari&rsquo;s power. It is truly &ldquo;beyond this world&rdquo;.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What kind of transformation is that? I have never seen it before.&rdquo; said Squire.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to need our help. All of us.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right about that.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> Nebula flew up and now everyone is at the same altitude. The heroes have surrounded Squire on all four sides. Despite being outnumbered, Squire was confident in his power so he remained calm and unfazed. The four heroes all powered up at once - they screamed at the top of their lungs until they reached their max power level.</p></p>

<p><p>Squire clenched his fists and curled his biceps and spread his wings fully. When he powered up, everyone felt it. His ki had a sinister feel to it...it&rsquo;s the same feeling as when someone stares at the Mirrari for the first time. They all felt Squire&rsquo;s ancient and immense power. He created shockwaves that expand forever...and they changed the environment&rsquo;s colors. Everyone was startled and winced from his ki.</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was still inside the palace. She was crawling towards the window but did not get far in her condition. She felt the sinister ki and grew worried about Tyson and her friends. But having no energy left, she fell unconscious on the floor.</p></p>

<p><p>Despite being afraid, the heroes have no choice but to fight. Nebula and Tyson were the first ones to take jabs at him. One attacked from the left and the other from the right. Squire was able to fend them both off with his speed. *Pow wham bam whack* He knocked him both away. *Wham whack*</p></p>

<p><p>Mac fired an electric beam at Squire and he was paralyzed by it. &ldquo;Ughhh!&rdquo; His torso tilted backwards and he grunted in agony.</p></p>

<p><p>With him being wide open, Zell flew forward and punched him in the face. *Thud* Squire&rsquo;s eyes opened and he smiled. Zell was shocked, realizing that Squire was pretending to be hurt. He gathered a ball and hit Zell&rsquo;s chest at point blank range. *Bam* Zell was knocked on the ground.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Zelfire!&rdquo; screamed Tyson.</p></p>

<p><p>Neb and Mac charged at him from different angles. Squire hit them both in the face. *Pow pow* They were both knocked out.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson fired a golden beam into the sky. Squire flew around the beam swiftly. With his wings, he was able to move unlike the others. Tyson fired another beam, even bigger than the previous one. Squire flew around it and flew closer to the sayan. Tyson stopped firing but it was too late to react. Squire kicked him in the chest several times.</p></p>

<p><p>*Whack whack* Tyson was sent backwards...but he still could move. He threw energy balls so fast it was like a machine gun. *Bam bam bam* Squire dodged all of them as he&rsquo;s faster than the balls. He fired a thick white beam and it hit Tyson and pushed him into a column of rock and exploded. *Boom*</p></p>

<p><p>Witnessing the explosion he created, Squire was on a high and he laughed out loud. &ldquo;Ha ha ha ha ha! Ah ha ha ha!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p><strong>*Zap*</strong> A beam hit his back, destroying part of his wings and features sprayed everywhere. &ldquo;Ugh! Who...&rdquo; Squire turned around with red angry eyes.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus&rsquo;s palm was open and smoke came out of it.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Rubeus?!&rdquo; Squire snarled with bloodshot eyes. He landed on the ground. &ldquo;Rubeus, are you helping these fools? Has the Mirrari turned you into a goody-two-shoes?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t misunderstand. I am not doing this because it&rsquo;s &lsquo;the right thing to do&rsquo; or something stupid like that. I just don&rsquo;t like the idea that anyone is stronger than me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ha...hahahaha!&rdquo; Squire&rsquo;s wings regenerated. &ldquo;Everyone is affected by my sorcery and you are no exception. When you were fighting Tyson Spade you backed down because your personality switched.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an abomination that shouldn&rsquo;t exist!&rdquo; Rubeus used Orb Storm, consequently twenty or more orbs appeared around him. Then he threw them forward.</p></p>

<p><p>Squire&rsquo;s wings folded and enclosed his body like a cocoon. The orbs hit him. *Kaboom* He was not affected by the attack. &ldquo;Was that supposed to hurt me?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus smiled. &ldquo;You fell for it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Squire didn&rsquo;t know what he meant but he was curious. He took a step forward but his body did not move. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; He tried to move his other limbs but none of them obeyed him.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You are being controlled by the Puppet Master.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Ohhh? So you&rsquo;re going to make me unable to defend myself?&rdquo; He was not worried, but rather entertained.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus was confused by his opponent&rsquo;s attitude towards the situation. But he shook off the bad feeling because this is his golden chance and he won&rsquo;t waste it. He charged forward and punched Squire non-stop. *Pow pow bam* Squire was thrown a few feet back.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He he he he he.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so funny? Have you lost your mind?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You think the Puppet Master can hold me?&rdquo; He looked up.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus was shocked. (He can see the puppet master?)</p></p>

<p><p>Squire clenched his fists and powered up to the maximum. His body generated shockwaves that expand infinitely and they changed the environment&rsquo;s colors. Rubeus winced from the enormous power. The strings on Squire&rsquo;s body broke off. Now that he can move, he blurred and appeared in front of Rubeus, and kicked him in the chest.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus scraped the ground. *Scrrrrrr* He was unable to get up.</p></p>

<center><p><span class="fanfic_section_title" id="g">[ G ] - The 500 Year Legacy </span></p></center>

<p><p>Tyson was watching these events transpire from a distance. He was shocked that Rubeus is helping them. Or is he? Whatever his intentions may be, they now have a common enemy. Even if Rubeus is defeated, he has accomplished one thing: to buy time for Tyson to recover.</p></p>

<p><p>Despite his condition, Nebula stood up, is ki emanating from his body.</p></p>

<p><p>Squire felt Nebula&rsquo;s ki. &ldquo;You can still stand?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula held his wrist with his other hand and gathered ki into his palm. He was charging up for his most powerful attack, the <strong>Nebulon Blast</strong>. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if you can take this.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Squire knew he was about to do a big attack so he charged up his own big attack. His wings extended themselves fully and his body was glowing white. A beam of light appeared with Squire&rsquo;s body in the middle. *Zap*</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson was startled. The Mirrari warrior resembled an angel of light with inconceivable power. Nebula was finished with the charge and his ki took the form of a blue ball with a ring around it. &ldquo;Nebulon Blast!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>He threw the ball forward and Squire fired his beam of light. The two forces collided in the middle and exploded. Everyone winced from the brightness.</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula was in shock that his strongest move was countered. &ldquo;No way...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Squire blurred and appeared in front of him and grabbed him and slammed him into the grass. *Scrrrrr* Nebula scraped the grass until he lost momentum and stopped. The Mirarri warrior held him by the neck and lifted him off his feet. &ldquo;Now do you see? You mortals can never summon enough power to defeat me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Suddenly, Tyson the Super Sayan punched him in the face, making him let Nebula go. Squire fell face flat on the ground. He got up and wiped the blood off his mouth. &ldquo;Hmm. Nice one. But that won&rsquo;t happen again.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyke made a grimace and powered up and right after that he charged forward. Squire charged forward and they hit on the elbows. *Wham*</p></p>

<p><p>Then they took it to the air and hit all over the place. Nebula&rsquo;s eyes opened. &ldquo;Damn...I wasn&rsquo;t able to stop him.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The two colossal forces moved as fast as jets and crashed as hard as a freight train into each other. They seem even at first but the difference was clear. Squire was able to hit Tyke, causing him to lose control for a second. Then Squire moved so fast he looked like a white beam, moving around Tyke and hitting him from different angles. *Wham wham* He hit Tyke on the back, making fall down. Then he appeared from the bottom and kicked Tyke in the stomach, causing him to fly up. *Whoosh* Squire appeared behind Tyke and caught him in a full nelson.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyke struggled to get free but it was useless. One can&rsquo;t break out of a full nelson with brute force. &ldquo;Going up.&rdquo; said Squire. He took Tyke up to a higher altitude. &ldquo;Going down.&rdquo; Then they both turned upside down and flew to the ground like a torpedo. Tyke screamed for his life while desperately trying to break free.</p></p>

<p><p>Just a second before they hit the ground, Squire let go and flew away. Tyke was the only one that hit the ground. *Kaboom*</p></p>

<p><p>When the smoke cleared, Tyke seen coughing. He had dirt all over his head and face. Squire threw two energy balls down. Tyke back flipped away, barely avoiding the explosions. Squire fired two more balls. Tyke back flipped away. The smoke covered the whole area so the ground was not seen. Suddenly, Tyson jumped out of the smoke and dashed forward. Squire flapped his wings and the air pressure hit Tyson&rsquo;s face and he winced. Squire flew in a triangular path and struck him.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyke landed face first on the ground and his hair turned from gold to black. Despite having almost no energy left, Tyson forced himself to stand up. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not over yet...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Squire crossed his arms. &ldquo;Let me guess, you never give up, right? That&rsquo;s one of your many personality traits. A very annoying one, at that. And one that will get you killed.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worked out so far.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I know you inside and out, Spade. I know all of your personalities...after all, I was the one that brought them out.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;These are lottery tickets.&rdquo; Tyson replied. He was not speaking in his usual manner. He had dark circles under his eyes and his eyes have lost its luster. &ldquo;I bought as many as I can. With these I&rsquo;ll be rich! Rich! Hahahaha!&rdquo; He threw the tickets in air and made it rain lottery tickets.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah I remember that.&rdquo; Tyson said with an angry look on his face. &ldquo;You were able to manipulate me even when you were trapped in that orb.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny how guys like you keep acting like you&rsquo;re the hero of justice and yet you are the same as everyone else. You have a dark side just like everyone else.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson was panting for breath. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the same. Yes I have desires just like them...but I control my urges and keep my dark side in check. That&rsquo;s what makes me different than them. Like Rubeus.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You are merely repressing those other sides of you. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before desires and greed take over. Let me demonstrate for you.&rdquo; Squire opened his palm and did something with his hand.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson&rsquo;s head tilted backwards and his face was not seen. Moments later, Tyson&rsquo;s head returned to normal position but he was not the same as before. &ldquo;What am I doing here? I should be making money. Money is the only thing that matters.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire was too injured to do anything so all he could was watch.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s see your villainous side.&rdquo; The Mirrari warrior opened his palm again and activated his spell. Tyson&rsquo;s head tilted backwards and his body froze up.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I know I don&rsquo;t have a chance of defeating you. We should team up.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What about your allies?&rdquo; asked Squire.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about them.&rdquo; he said apathetically. &ldquo;I only care about my own life. I don&rsquo;t mind if they die so I can live. It&rsquo;s the only logical choice.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Zelfire was shocked to hear these words. &ldquo;No way...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Squire activated his spell yet again. He was enjoying this. &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s see your cowardly side.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson&rsquo;s personality changed yet again. His eyes were shaking from fear. &ldquo;I am no match for you...there&rsquo;s no way. You&rsquo;re too powerful.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The Mirrari warrior laughed out loud. &ldquo;Ha ha ha ha. What happened to all that toughness earlier?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m outta here!&rdquo; Tyson turned around and ran away.</p></p>

<p><p>Squire appeared in front of him and Tyson gasped. Squire jabbed him in the stomach, causing him to grab his wound and stutter backwards. Then he fell on his knees. &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> He has done it many times, but the Mirrari warrior never gets tired of messing with people&rsquo;s heads. By manipulating people&rsquo;s personalities, he led them to ruin. People have lost their jobs, families, homes, even entire kingdoms have fallen due to his spell.</p></p>

<p><p>He opened his palm. (Let&rsquo;s see what other personality he has.) Squire did a scan of Tyson&rsquo;s consciousness and subconscious. He searched deeper and deeper, straight into the depths of the sayan&rsquo;s psyche. Suddenly, he found something. (Oh? What&rsquo;s this? This personality is unlike any other he has.) Using his signature spell, he released this part of Tyson&rsquo;s personality by bringing it to the surface.</p></p>

<p><p>The sayan did not respond well to this as he groaned in pain. He grabbed his head while his head shook back and forth. It&rsquo;s as if he&rsquo;s trying to rip his own brain out. &ldquo;Arrrgh! Uuuuugh!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>After what felt like a long time, his groaning finally stopped. His breath returned to normal and he began to stand up. But the look in his eyes changed - he had no eyeballs. Squire was startled, having an ominous feeling about this.</p></p>

<p><p>Veins popped up in Tyson&rsquo;s forehead and the various muscles on his arm. He powered up and his hair turned a vibrant golden color.</p></p>

<p><p>Squire covered his eyes. &ldquo;This is just the super sayan transformation. No, it&rsquo;s not the same, it&rsquo;s more powerful than a super sayan!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the same.&rdquo; said Zelfire. &ldquo;This is the <strong>third stage</strong>.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Third Stage?&rdquo; Squire repeated.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The first stage is Tyson&rsquo;s normal state. When he becomes a super sayan, he is the second stage. But he has a hidden power that never comes out under normal circumstances - the third stage. It is a power stronger than the super sayan. It is considered a different transformation but in this stage he has no control over himself. He can&rsquo;t tell friend from foe...he might as well be a beast...or killing machine.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Killing machine?&rdquo; Squire repeated. &ldquo;This should be interesting.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The sayan continued to power up, increasing his power level even further. Everyone within the vicinity felt his ki.</p></p>

<p><p>Mac was laying on the ground. &ldquo;T-Tyson...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Nebula was in the same boat. &ldquo;Ugh...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p> Inside the palace, Faith was almost by the window. She did not see the battle but was able to sense everyone&rsquo;s ki...and right now Tyson&rsquo;s ki is growing nonstop to a point that&rsquo;s scary.</p></p>

<p><p> Tyson stared at his opponent with those lifeless eyes of his. He grunted and his fingers clenched into fists. He charged forward and unleashed a fury of punches. Squire did a boxer&rsquo;s guard to block all the punches. *Pow bam pow* Squire flew backwards while Tyson flew forward. His punches have no rhythm or pattern, but he hit fast and hard. *Pow pow pow*</p></p>

<p><p>They went to the air and the punches never stopped. It&rsquo;s just as Zelfire described - Tyson was not the Tyson you knew. He has no consciousness, reason or logic, but rather, a killing machine that treats anything that moves as an enemy. Squire&rsquo;s arms was starting to feel sore. *Pow pow pow* Suddenly, he punched Squire in the chest, causing him to drop his guard. Then he punched Squire&rsquo;s face. *Kapow*</p></p>

<p><p>Squire threw an energy ball and Tyson knocked it away. Squire threw two more balls and Tyson flew into them, using his arms to block the explosion. Squire was surprised by that. Tyson appeared in front of him and punched him in the face. *Wham*</p></p>

<p><p>The enraged sayan gathered ki and threw energy balls in Squire&rsquo;s direction. The Mirrari warrior flew backwards while dodging the balls. (So he attacks without regard to his own safety. That&rsquo;s his weakness. The third stage makes him more powerful, but also an easy target.) Suddenly, he got an idea.</p></p>

<p><p>Squire gathered energy into both hands. The amount of ki was enough to kill even someone in the third stage. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? I&rsquo;m over here. Come and get me.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson grunted angrily. He did not understand the words, but he did understand that he was being taunted. He powered up and dashed forward, becoming a golden meteor.</p></p>

<p><p>Squire was almost done charging his attack. &ldquo;Time to say goodbye!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Zelfire screamed.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson was almost within Squire&rsquo;s range...then suddenly he stopped moving. Squire was surprised and disappointed. There&rsquo;s a rose in Tyson&rsquo;s pocket and it was glowing. This was what caused him to stop moving. Suddenly, his eyeballs returned to him and he looked at his own hands. He was conscious once again.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What? You have returned? How?&rdquo; asked Squire.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because of this.&rdquo; he took out the rose that Faith gave him.</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson placed Faith in a sitting position against the wall. &ldquo;Stay put. I&rsquo;m going to check out what&rsquo;s happening outside.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Come back soon.&rdquo; she murmured. Then she handed him a rose.</p></p>

<p><p>He stared at it and smiled. &ldquo;I will...I promise.&rdquo; He put the rose in his pocket and jumped out the window.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I was asleep but now I am awake thanks to this rose. It&rsquo;s more than just a rose. It has Faith&rsquo;s spirit in it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Faith was sprawled on the ground, her arms and head draped over the window. &ldquo;Tyson...&rdquo; She can feel Tyson&rsquo;s spirit from where she is, just as he can feel hers from his position.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This rose is what saved me. Thank you Faith.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;A rose woke you up? That&rsquo;s ridiculous!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>The sayan charged and attacked furiously while Squire defended. *Pow wham bam* Tyson has the same speed and power as before except now he was conscious. he can now use the third stage freely, which makes him a threat. Squire flew back a good distance away and shot a ball of energy and hit Tyson. *Zap* He was about to fire a second ball when his ribs hurt. &ldquo;Ugh...&rdquo; He grabbed his ribs. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me this wound is from that time he hit me?&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>*Pow pow pow* Suddenly, he punched Squire in the chest, causing him to drop his guard. Then he punched Squire&rsquo;s face. *Kapow*</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is from the previous punch? How can he damage me that much?!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson recovered from the attack. He blurred and appeared on top of Squire and kicked him in the face. *Whack* Squire was falling halfway to the ground when he recovered. Tyson put his palms together and fired the Wrath Beam. *Froom* The Mirrari warrior was hit and slammed into the ground. The impact created a cloud of dust several feet wide.</p></p>

<p><p>Squire stood up and he was panting for breath. The confidence and arrogance he had earlier was gone - right now he was struggling against Tyson&rsquo;s new transformation. He no longer had the advantage and this made him angry.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the type of person who enjoys messing with other people&rsquo;s personalities.&rdquo; Tyson appeared on the ground. &ldquo;You treat people like toys and ruin their live without batting an eye. You don&rsquo;t have a personality of your own.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson appeared directly in front of him. Squire threw a punch and Tyson blocked it with ease. Squire panicked pulled his hand away and jumped back.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You must be sad and empty on the inside. Not knowing the love of a family. You take out your unhappiness on others.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What would you know? I&rsquo;ve lived ten times longer than you! My ability has ruined entire kingdoms!&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m going to make sure you never get to do it again.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Squire grunted angrily and powered up. But his power level did not increase - all he was doing was charging his body up with his remaining ki. He flapped his wings and the air hit Tyson&rsquo;s face, causing him to wince. Then he charged at him with lightning speed and kneed him in the stomach. Tyke groaned from the impact. From an angle, it looked like his knee hit Tyke directly. But from the front view, Tyke actually blocked the knee with both hands. Squire was in disbelief it didn&rsquo;t work. Tyke answered him with an upper. *Pow* The Mirrari warrior was knocked to the air.</p></p>

<p><p>He grunted angrily and flew down and punched but his fist went through Tyke because it was an after image. Tyke appeared from above and kicked him in the back. Squire hit the ground. Tyke appeared from the side and kicked him in the stomach, causing him to be knocked away.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This can&rsquo;t be happening.&rdquo; said the Mirrari warrior. Tyke was walking towards him at a normal pace. Eventually he was directly in front of him. &ldquo;I am supposed to be invincible...&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>With his opponent wide open, Tyson stuck his hand inside his chest. But it wasn&rsquo;t easy because he had to use up all his ki and physical strength to get inside. Squire screamed and grunted as he resisted with all he had. But it was no use resisting the inevitable. Tyson&rsquo;s hand pulled the Mirrari out of his chest.</p></p>

<p><p>As soon as the orb was out, Squire&rsquo;s wings disappeared, leaving behind orphaned feathers. Squire stumbled forward while hunching back. &ldquo;Ughh...&rdquo; he groaned while drooling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the most powerful warrior in history...but I was beaten by a rose?&rdquo; Those were his final words before he collapsed. *Splat*</p></p>

<p><p>Tyson held the Mirrari in his hand and he punched it into pieces. *Crack* The cracking sound echoed throughout the area, possibly the entire world. The environment flashed different colors...and seconds later everything went back to normal. The palace was safe and they were back to their timeline.</p></p>

<p><p>The sayan turned him over to check his heartbeat. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s fine, he&rsquo;s just unconscious.&rdquo; he said to whoever was still awake.</p></p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good to know.&rdquo; Zell replied.</p></p>

<p><p>Rubeus was missing, so it is assumed that he escaped in the middle of the battle. Faith was still inside the palace, alive and resting. She recovered shortly afterwards. And because of her healing, everyone&rsquo;s injuries were healed instantly. Fortunately, she was not exposed to the Mirrari for too long, so her personality returned to normal.</p></p>

<p><p>The same was true for Squire. Once he woke up, he was no longer greedy and was baffled by his own actions.</p></p>

<p><p>The legendary demon was defeated and the Mirrari was broken into a thousand pieces. The nightmare was over...not just for the heroes, but for everyone whose lives were affected by the Mirrari for the past five hundred years. Their souls have been avenged and they can truly rest in peace for all of eternity.</p></p>

<p> <p>End.</p></p>
